40286246,Investigation of Anticancer Peptides Derived from <i>Arca</i> Species Using In Silico Analysis.,"This study employed an integrated in silico approach to identify and characterize anticancer peptides (ACPs) derived from <i>Arca</i> species. Using a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline (BIOPEP, ToxinPred, ProtParam, ChemDraw, SwissTargetPrediction, and I-TASSER), we screened hydrolyzed bioactive peptides from <i>Arca</i> species, identifying seventeen novel peptide candidates. Subsequent in vitro validation revealed three peptides (KW, WQIWYK, KGKWQIWYKSL) with significant anticancer activity, demonstrating both high biosafety and clinical potential. Our findings highlight <i>Arca</i> species proteins as a valuable source of therapeutic ACPs and establish bioinformatics as an efficient strategy for rapid discovery of bioactive peptides. This approach combines computational prediction with experimental validation, offering a robust framework for developing novel peptide-based therapeutics.",2025-04-07
40279769,"A comprehensive review of small molecules, targets, and pathways in ulcerative colitis treatment.","Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), poses significant clinical challenges because of its complex pathophysiology, long-term nature, and the limited efficacy of existing treatments. Small-molecule compounds, particularly those that are able to modulate inflammation-related signaling pathways and, in many cases, occur in nature, offer a promising alternative or supplement to conventional therapies. Studies on molecules for UC therapeutics reported in 1394 publications over the past 30 years were collected from the Web of Science (WOS) database. Only studies that verified therapeutic efficacy through animal experiments were included. Through an analysis of the molecular classes, structures, common targets, and pathways using network pharmacology, we identified 14 classes of compounds, 5 direct-target modules, and 3 crucial downstream pathways. Alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, and terpenes (and their derivatives) appeared most frequently and mainly targeted lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, immune regulation, signaling transduction, and cancer-related pathways. Notably, there has been an increasing trend of applying naturally sourced compounds in both preclinical and clinical trials, especially flavonoids, over the last five years. Although progress in UC research has been made, the majority of studies have focused on the overall therapeutic effects and biomarker alterations, with limited emphasis on the direct targets and underlying mechanisms. These findings highlight the need to explore novel small-molecule therapeutic strategies for UC, focusing on clearly defined targets and precise modes of action.",2025-04-15
40269496,High-throughput screen identifies MAS9 as a novel inhibitor of the C-type lectin receptor-2 (CLEC-2)-podoplanin interaction.,"The C-type lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2) is a platelet receptor for the endogenous ligand podoplanin. This interaction contributes to several (patho)physiological processes, such as lymphangiogenesis, preservation of blood and lymphatic vessel integrity organ development, and tumour metastasis. Activation of CLEC-2 leads to the phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic hemITAM domain and initiates a signalling cascade involving the kinase Syk. The aim of this study was to identify and characterise a novel small molecule inhibitor of CLEC-2.",2025-04-23
40262387,Positional isoform analysis of PEGylated biotherapeutic protein using a novel peptide-based reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection.,"PEGylation, the covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to biomolecules, is a well-established molecular modification strategy that enhances the pharmacological properties of conjugated proteins by improving stability, reducing immunogenicity, extending half-life, and increasing solubility. Despite its benefits, PEGylated proteins are often heterogeneous mixtures containing positional isoforms that are challenging to eliminate and can significantly impact the biological activity of drugs. This study developed a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for the separation and quantification of positional isoforms in commercial PEGylated recombinant human growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) at the peptide level. In this strategy, PEG-rhGH was digested into peptides via trypsin treatment and then separated and quantified using RP-UPLC. Under the chromatography condition optimized from Quality by Design (QbD) principles, this method can effectively distinguish the PEGylated peptides in five isomers. MALDI-TOF MS, SDS-PAGE and Edman degradation indicated that each of these five isomers was conjugated with one 40 kDa branched PEG at a specific lysine residue and the N-terminal. Through the concentration correction of PEGylated peptides varying in sequence lengths, the proportion of five modified sites can be quantified. The comparative assay showed that this strategy effectively addresses the limitations of the commonly used IEC method, especially under challenging conditions like post-translational modifications (e.g., oxidation, deamidation, and cyclization) and conformational changes. As a result, it offers improved robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed RP-UPLC method exhibited outstanding repeatability across various storage conditions, making it a reliable tool for quality control and product release in the biopharmaceutical industry.",2025-04-17
40257351,Radiosynthesis and Evaluation of a Novel <sup>68</sup>Ga-Labeled Peptide for PD-L1-Targeted PET Imaging.,"Although programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-targeted immunotherapy has demonstrated favorable therapeutic effects, concern regarding a low response rate persists. Our study aimed to develop a novel peptide probe for PD-L1 targeting positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging as an alternative for assessing PD-L1 expression and exploring its potential role in guiding PD-L1 immunotherapy <i>in vivo</i>. The probe targeting PD-L1 was obtained by modifying 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) with the peptide CCC, followed by labeling with <sup>68</sup>Ga. Radiochemical purity, log <i>P</i>, pharmacokinetics, and stability of the probe were evaluated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The systematic evaluation of the probe performance included microPET/CT imaging, biodistribution, biosafety, and an investigation of its use in immunotherapy monitoring. <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-CCC was successfully synthesized with over 99% radiochemical purity, eliminating the need for purification. The probe exhibited good hydrophilicity and stability and was rapidly metabolized with a short blood clearance half-life of 16.1 ± 0.5 min. Additionally, the probe exhibited an excellent PD-L1 targeting ability, with tumor uptake positively correlating with PD-L1 expression levels in both cellular experiments and microPET/CT imaging. Moreover, the dynamic expression of PD-L1 was assessed using <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-CCC during atezolizumab administration. <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-CCC accurately reflects PD-L1 expression and holds promise for precisely guiding PD-L1-targeted immunotherapy.",2025-04-21
40257194,Dysregulation of miR-330-3p is Involved in the Occurrence and Development of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Caused by Congenital Heart Disease.,The study aimed to investigate the expression of miR-330-3p and its clinical and functional performance in congenital heart disease-associated pulmonary hypertension (CHD-PAH).,2025-04-21
40239269,Identification of novel small molecule chaperone activators for neurodegenerative disease treatment.,"A pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative disease is the accumulation of aberrant protein aggregates which contribute to the cytotoxicity and are therefore a target for therapy development. One key mechanism to manage cellular protein homeostasis is heat shock proteins (HSPs), protein chaperones which are known to target aberrant protein accumulation. Activation of HSPs target aberrant TDP-43, tau and amyloid to rescue neurodegenerative disease. As an attempt to target HSP activation for neurodegeneration therapy, we here develop a drug screening assay to identify compounds that will activate the master regulator of HSPs, the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). As HSF1 is bound by HSP90 which prevents its activation, we developed a NanoBRET assay, which allows us to monitor and quantify the HSF1-HSP90 interaction in living cells to screen for compounds disrupting this interaction and thereby releasing HSF1 for activation. After the optimisation and validation of the assay, a two thousand compound library was screened which produced 10 hits including two known HSP90 inhibitors. Follow-up functional study showed that one of the hits oxyphenbutazone (OPB) significantly reduces the accumulation of insoluble TDP-43 in a cell model, eliciting no signs of stress or toxicity. Overall, this study demonstrates a viable strategy for new drug discovery in targeting aberrant proteins and identifies potential candidates for translation into neurodegenerative disease treatment.",2025-04-15
40236546,"Targeting Oncogenic Pathways: Advances in KRAS, CDK, EGFR, and PROTAC-Based Therapies.","Recent advancements in cancer therapy focus on targeting critical mutations and regulatory pathways, particularly KRAS mutations and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which drive cancer progression. This Patent Highlight showcases the development of novel small-molecule inhibitors for KRAS and CDKs, highlighting their mechanisms of action, critical findings from preclinical studies, and the potential for improving therapeutic outcomes in cancers such as nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal, and pancreatic cancers.",2025-03-11
40229415,A novel peptide RR-171 derived from human umbilical cord serum induces apoptosis and pyroptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.,"Human umbilical cord serum is full of molecules that play vital roles in foetal development. This study aimed to explore the effects of RR-171, a novel peptide derived from umbilical cord serum, on pancreatic cancer cells and to elucidate its mechanisms. The anti-pancreatic cancer properties of RR-171 were detected by a cell counting kit-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, LDH release and EdU incorporation assays. RNA sequencing and gene enrichment analysis were applied to identify the differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways. Western blotting analysis was used to detect the expression of proteins. A subcutaneous xenograft model was used to examine the effect of RR-171 on pancreatic cancer cells in vivo. The results demonstrated that RR-171 inhibited the viability, proliferation and colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that RR-171 inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, RR-171 significantly induced apoptosis and pyroptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Z-VAD-FMK partly reversed the proapoptotic effect of RR-171, and VX-765 partly reversed the pro-pyroptotic effect of RR-171. Finally, RR-171 inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in a subcutaneous xenograft mice model and suppressed the expression of Ki-67 and PCNA in tumors. In conclusion, RR-171 induces apoptosis and pyroptosis through multiple pathways and inhibits pancreatic cancer growth, suggesting that RR-171 might be a potential agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",2025-04-14
40228125,The emergence and loss of cyclic peptides in <i>Nicotiana</i> illuminate dynamics and mechanisms of plant metabolic evolution.,"Specialized metabolism plays a central role in how plants cope with both biotic and abiotic stresses in order to survive and reproduce within dynamic and challenging environments. One recently described class of plant-specific, ribosomally synthesized, and posttranslationally modified peptides are the burpitides, which are characterized by the installation of distinct sidechain macrocycles by enzymes known as burpitide cyclases. While they are found across many plant families and exhibit diverse bioactivities, little is known about their evolution or how new variants arise. Here, we present the identification of a burpitide cyclase, resurrected from a defunct pseudogene from the model organism <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>, the coyote tobacco. By repairing the pseudogene <i>ΨNatBURP2</i> and expressing it heterologously in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, we successfully reconstituted its original enzymatic activity. As an autocatalytic peptide cyclase, it installs a unique C-C bond between the tyrosine side chain and a specific backbone α-carbon of a heptapeptide core motif, resulting in burpitides dubbed ""nanamins."" Despite its pseudogenization in <i>N. attenuata</i>, we found that the closely related species, <i>Nicotiana clevelandii</i>, retains the wild-type gene and produces nanamins. Phylogenetic analyses and targeted mutagenesis experiments reveal that this chemotype must have evolved from the duplication and neofunctionalization of a more promiscuous ancestral gene. This work highlights how novel peptide chemotypes may rapidly emerge and disappear in plants, while expanding the molecular toolkit for engineering novel peptides with applications in agriculture and drug discovery.",2025-04-14
40214124,Identification of novel small molecule inhibitors of ETS transcription factors.,"The evolutionarily conserved E-Twenty-Six (ETS) family of transcription factors acts downstream of major signal transduction pathways and plays a pivotal role in tissue development and maintenance. Importantly, their function is frequently corrupted in a substantial proportion of tumour types, and they are also indispensable for angiogenic sprouting, a hallmark of cancer, which is essential for fuelling tumour enlargement and dissemination. Consequently, targeting aberrant ETS activity could potentially represent a precise and effective means by which to block tumour growth. Here, we present proof-of-principle high-throughput screens and an initial characterization of candidate hits, as a methodological and conceptual framework for the identification of novel ETS transcription factor inhibitors, which may ultimately lead to new therapeutic avenues for treating cancer.",2025-04-11
40212079,A Novel Piezo1 Agonist Promoting Mesenchymal Stem Cell Proliferation and Osteogenesis to Attenuate Disuse Osteoporosis.,"Disuse osteoporosis (OP) is a state of bone loss due to lack of mechanical stimuli, probably induced by prolonged bed rest, neurological diseases, as well as microgravity. Currently the precise treatment strategies of disuse OP remain largely unexplored. Piezo1, a mechanosensitive calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ion channel, is a key force sensor mediating mechanotransduction and it is demonstrated to regulate bone homeostasis and osteogenesis in response to mechanical forces. Using structure-based drug design, a novel small-molecule Piezo1 agonist, MCB-22-174, which can effectively activate Piezo1 and initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, is developed and is more potent than the canonical Piezo1 agonist, Yoda1. Moreover, MCB-22-174 is found as a safe Piezo1 agonist without any signs of serious toxicity. Mechanistically, Piezo1 activation promotes the proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by activating the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related extracellular signal-related kinases and calcium-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) pathway. Importantly, MCB-22-174 could effectively promote osteogenesis and attenuate disuse OP in vivo. Overall, the findings provide a promising therapeutic strategy for disuse OP by chemical activation of Piezo1.",2024-06-30
40207932,Research strategies of the N-peptide fusion inhibitor: a promising direction for discovering novel antivirals.,"AIDS, caused by HIV-1, is a devastating condition that severely compromises the human immune system, often resulting in fatal consequences. The primary therapeutic approach for AIDS involves a combination of multiple agents, known as ""cocktail therapy,"" aimed at maximizing and sustainably suppressing viral replication within patients. The ongoing discovery of novel compounds and the establishment of innovative research strategies have become the mandatory path to provide increasingly effective treatment options for AIDS. Peptide-based fusion inhibitors, exemplified as enfuvirtide, are able to target the six-helix bundle fusion core in HIV-1 envelope protein and function during the early stage of viral invasion. However, the prolonged and intensive use of enfuvirtide in clinical settings has posed significant challenges, including the emergence of drug resistance. N-peptide fusion inhibitors, whose sequences are different from enfuvirtide, exhibit potential anti-HIV-1 activity and inhibition of drug-resistant strains through the advanced coiled-coil conformation and are expected to serve as novel peptide inhibitors in the iteration of enfuvirtide. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of N-peptide fusion inhibitor research and development (R&D) to date, with the aim of providing investigators with prospective ideas for exploring antivirals.",2025-04-10
40207083,Effects of the number of ethylene glycol units on the efficacy of novel complex I inhibitor 9bw.,"4'-Iodobiphenyl nonaethylene glycol ether (9bw) is a novel small molecule, composed of a biphenyl unit and 9 ethylene glycol (EG) units. Recently, we found that 9bw induces apoptosis in cancer cells by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory complex I (CI) and accordingly reducing cellular ATP level. In addition, 9bw shows little effect on normal cells, suggesting that 9bw is a potential antitumor agent with few adverse effects. However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which 9bw acts on CI are still elusive. To clarify the molecular structure critical for 9bw's function, we tested the function of 9bw analogues on human oral squamous cell carcinoma lines HSC4 and Ca9-22. The analogues were 4-hydroxy-4'-iodobiphenyl (HIOP), I-BP-EG3, I-BP-EG6, and I-BP-EG12 containing 0, 3, 6, and 12 EG units, respectively. Our results demonstrated that I-BP-EG6 and I-BP-EG12 inhibited CI to a similar extent as 9bw, whereas I-BP3 and HIOP showed no effect on CI activity. These observations indicate that the number of EG units is crucial for the activity of 9bw and its analogues. As high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis demonstrated that both HIOP and I-BP-EG3 could be incorporated into mitochondria abundantly, the number of EG units probably affects CI inhibitory function of 9bw and its analogues rather than their efficacy to enter cell and mitochondria.",2025-03-20
40199779,Iterative Optimization Yields Stapled Peptides with Superior Pharmacokinetics and Potency for Renal Fibrosis Treatment.,"Renal fibrosis, resulting from myofibroblast-mediated excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, lacks effective treatments. Novel peptide DR3penA developed by our group showed therapeutic potential for fibrotic diseases; however, its application was hindered by poor stability and bioavailability. To address this unmet need, we implemented stepwise optimization of DR3penA. The conformationally restricted analogs designed via structural predictions enhanced both activity and stability. Through structure-activity relationship analysis and cleavage site mapping, introducing unnatural amino acids improved stability. Fatty acid modifications conferred fibroblast-selective cytotoxicity and improved pharmacokinetics. After several rounds of progressive modification, peptide <b>27</b> exhibited remarkable stability, with a 5.68-fold extended half-life compared to DR3penA. Following profibrotic stimuli, peptide <b>27</b> effectively inhibited myofibroblast activation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and ECM synthesis. It also attenuated renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction model. Our study leverages multiple modifications that integrate cell and animal models to identify peptide <b>27</b> as a promising candidate for renal fibrosis therapy.",2025-04-08
40191352,<sup>68</sup>Ga-Labeled Peptide for Noninvasive Quantifying Tumor Exposure of PD-L1 Therapeutics.,"Targeting the programmed death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) immune checkpoint blockade therapy plays a critical role in cancer therapy. However, not all patients benefit from this approach, with PD-L1 expression levels being a significant contributing factor. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of PD-L1 offers a noninvasive, whole-body, and dynamic assessment of its expression. This study aims to develop a novel peptide-based PD-L1 tracer, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]HF12, to quantitatively evaluate PD-L1 expression in tumors, thereby offering clinical guidance.",2025-03-18
40187756,Conformation-sensitive targeting of CD18 depletes M2-like tumor-associated macrophages resulting in inhibition of solid tumor progression.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) primarily exist in the M2-like phenotype in the tumor microenvironment (TME). M2-TAMs contribute to tumor progression by establishing an immunosuppressive environment. However, TAM targeting is hindered, mainly owing to a lack of specific biomarkers for M2-TAMs. Previously, we demonstrated that a novel peptide drug conjugate (TB511) consisting of a TAM-binding peptide and the apoptosis-promoting peptide targets M2-TAMs. This was achieved through M2-TAM targeting, although the target mechanism of action remained elusive. Herein, we elucidate the anticancer efficacy of TB511 by identifying new target proteins that preferentially bind to M2-TAMs and clarifying the apoptosis-inducing mechanism in these cells.",2025-04-05
40179614,Synthesis and structure-activity evaluation of a series of novel tricyclic STING activators.,"A novel small molecule tricyclic series of STING activators was designed, synthesized and evaluated for human STING activity. These STING agonists were optimized from an initial set of structures with low potency through iterative cycles of design, synthesis and biological evaluation to yield compounds with potent human STING activity. The binding and functional properties of 68, an exemplar from the series were determined. Further, while 68 activated major variants of human STING it did not activate murine STING. Treatment of human PBMCs led to pathway engagement and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. When administered intra-tumorally, 68 caused robust retardation in the growth of MCA205 mouse fibrosarcoma tumors in human STING knock-in mice.",2025-03-28
40177869,Broadening the Therapeutic Window of ADCs Using Site-Specific Bioconjugation Showcased by an MMAE-Containing Peptide Linker in a CD79b-Targeting ADC.,"The limitations of first-generation antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technologies include suboptimal stability and efficacy, poor safety profiles, and challenging manufacturing processes. In this study, we describe an anti-CD79b-monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) ADC generated using a novel peptide-based linker technology that allows for site-specific linker-payload conjugation to native antibodies in only one step. The ADC comprises native polatuzumab as the targeting antibody and a linker-payload consisting of a RKAA-peptide linker and MMAE. We compared our anti-CD79b-RKAA-MMAE ADC with polatuzumab vedotin (PV), the FDA-approved ADC for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In the clinic, PV shows significant instability in circulation, leading to strong and dose-limiting side effects, including neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy. The anti-CD79b-RKAA-MMAE ADC showed optimal biophysical properties with a well-defined drug-to-antibody ratio of 2. It demonstrated potent cytotoxicity in multiple cancer cell lines and was very stable in mouse, cynomolgus monkey, and human sera. The anti-CD79b-RKAA-MMAE conjugate showed equal antitumor efficacy at half the payload dose compared with PV in different xenograft models. At equal MMAE concentrations, greater tumor growth inhibition and a considerably longer duration of response were observed. Ultimately, the highest nonseverely toxic dose of 30 mg/kg was determined in a 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study in rats, which is a 3-fold higher ADC dose than reported for PV. In summary, the data show that our novel site-specific bioconjugation technology enabled the generation of an anti-CD79b-RKAA-MMAE ADC with highly favorable biophysical properties and a greatly improved therapeutic index by a factor of 4 to 6 compared with PV. The ADC may therefore represent a safe and efficacious alternative for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",2025-04-03
40177110,"Protein to biomaterials: Unraveling the antiviral and proangiogenic activities of Ac-Tβ<sub>1-17</sub> peptide, a thymosin β4 metabolite, and its implications in peptide-scaffold preparation.","Peptide metabolites are emerging biomolecules with numerous possibilities in biomaterial-based regenerative medicine due to their inherent bioactivities. These small, naturally occurring compounds are intermediates or byproducts of larger proteins and peptides, and they can have profound effects, such as antiviral therapeutics, proangiogenic agents, and regenerative medicinal applications. This study is among the first to focus on using thymosin β4 protein-derived metabolites to pioneer novel applications for peptide metabolites in biomaterials. This study found that the novel peptide metabolite acetyl-thymosin β4 (amino acid 1-17) (Ac-Tβ<sub>1-17</sub>) exhibited significant protease inhibition activity against SARS-CoV-2, surpassing its precursor protein. Additionally, Ac-Tβ<sub>1-17</sub> demonstrated beneficial effects, such as cell proliferation, wound healing, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Integrating Ac-Tβ<sub>1-17</sub> into a peptide-based scaffold facilitated cell growth and angiogenesis inside the scaffold and through gradual release into the surrounding environment. The Ac-Tβ<sub>1-17</sub> peptide treatment induced significant biochemical responses in HUVEC, increasing Akt, ERK, PI3K, MEK, and Bcl-2 gene expression and proangiogenic proteins. Ac-Tβ<sub>1-17</sub> peptide treatment showed similar results in ex vivo by enhancing mouse fetal metatarsal growth and angiogenesis. These findings highlight the potential of natural protein metabolites to generate biologically active peptides, offering a novel strategy for enhancing biomaterial compatibility. This approach holds promise for developing therapeutic biomaterials using peptide metabolites, presenting exciting prospects for future research and applications.",2025-03-19
40169588,Targeting METTL3 mitigates venetoclax resistance via proteasome-mediated modulation of MCL1 in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Venetoclax, a selective BCL2 inhibitor, is extensively utilized in clinical settings for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, its efficacy is often compromised by the development of drug resistance. Hence, identification of potential venetoclax combination treatment strategies is imperative to overcome this acquired resistance. In this study, we discovered that inhibition of METTL3 can synergistically enhance the anti-leukemic efficacy of venetoclax, and is capable of overcoming venetoclax resistance in in vivo experiments and various venetoclax resistance models. Mechanistic study revealed that STM2457 augmented venetoclax activity by downregulating MCL1 and MYC, thereby increasing apoptosis in leukemia cells induced by venetoclax. Further investigation demonstrated that STM2457 promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation of MCL1 primarily through pharmaceutically targeting METTL3. Moreover, through molecular docking-based virtual screening, we identified isoliquiritigenin as a potential novel small molecule natural product targeting METTL3, which exhibited potential effects as an anti-leukemic agent.",2025-04-01
40168838,pACPs-DNN: Predicting anticancer peptides using novel peptide transformation into evolutionary and structure matrix-based images with self-attention deep learning model.,"Globally, cancer remains a major health challenge due to its high mortality rates. Traditional experimental approaches and therapies are resource-intensive and often cause significant side effects. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) have emerged as alternative therapeutic agents owing to their selectivity, safety, and potential to mitigate drug resistance. In this paper, we propose pACPs-DNN, a novel attention mechanism-based deep learning model developed for the accurate prediction of ACPs and non-ACPs. The pACPs-DNN model transforms input peptides into image representations using residue-wise energy contact matrix (RECM), substitution Matrix Representation (SMR), and Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) embeddings, followed by local binary pattern (LBP)-based decomposition to capture enhanced structural and local semantic features. These transformations generate novel feature sets, including RECM_LBP, LBP_SMR, and LBP_PSSM. Subsequently, a two-tier feature selection approach is employed to identify a high-ranking optimal feature set, which is then used to train an attention-based deep neural network. The proposed pACPs-DNN model achieves an impressive training accuracy of 96.91 % and an AUC of 0.98. To evaluate its generalization capability, the model was validated on independent datasets, demonstrating significant improvements of 5 % and 3.5 % in accuracy over existing models on the Ind-I and Ind-II datasets, respectively. The demonstrated efficacy and robustness of pACPs-DNN highlight its potential as a valuable tool for advancing drug discovery and academic research in cancer-related therapeutic development.",2025-03-28
40165933,Novel peptide inhibitor for the Chikungunya virus nsP2 protease: Identification and characterization.,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging pathogen affecting populations worldwide, with rapidly increasing infection rates. CHIKV, an arbovirus of the alphavirus genus, is predominantly found in tropical regions and transmitted by <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes. Climate change has accelerated the global spread of these vectors, leading to outbreaks in non-tropical regions, including parts of Europe. The absence of antiviral therapies and the potential for co-infections with other viruses make CHIKV a significant public health concern. CHIKV replication relies on nsP2 cysteine protease activity to cleave its viral polyprotein into functional nonstructural and structural proteins. Targeting the nsP2 protease represents a promising strategy for antiviral therapy development. In this study, phage display was used to screen a library of peptides for potential binders of the target protease. Biophysical and biochemical analyses of the identified peptides assessed their inhibitory potential. Among the six identified peptides (named as P1-P6), four demonstrated inhibitory effects on the nsP2 protease (nsP2<sup>pro</sup>). Peptide P1 exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 4.6 ± 1.9 µM, and a low cytotoxicity. The secondary structure analysis through CD spectroscopy and homology modelling revealed that P1 adopts an alpha-helical conformation. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations enabled us to investigate the dynamics of the nsP2<sup>pro</sup> active site and molecular docking was employed to predict the orthosteric binding mode of P1, providing insights into protein-peptide interaction. These findings underscore the potential of peptide P1 as a lead compound for further investigation in the context of CHIKV research.",2025-03-11

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the only approved TB vaccine, has been shown to have highly variable protective efficacy in different populations and is ineffective at protecting adults. Therefore, the development of more effective TB vaccines is vital.",2025-03-27
40150858,AZP2006 (Ezeprogind<sup>®</sup>): a Promising New Drug Candidate in the Battle Against Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal tau protein accumulation. This perspective article explores AZP2006 (INN: Ezeprogind), a novel small molecule targeting the Progranulin (PGRN) and Prosaposin (PSAP) axis to enhance lysosomal health in PSP treatment. AZP2006 stabilizes the PGRN-PSAP complex, improving lysosomal function and reducing tau pathology. Preclinical studies in tauopathy models demonstrated AZP2006's ability to decrease tau hyperphosphorylation, enhance neuronal survival, mitigate neuroinflammation and promote synaptogenesis. Clinical trials have shown AZP2006 to be well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and PSP patients. A Phase 2a study met its primary endpoints, as it provided valuable safety data and even encouraged further investigation of its efficacy in a larger clinical study. An upcoming Phase 2b/3 trial aims to assess long-term safety and efficacy in a larger PSP cohort. AZP2006's mechanism of action strongly suggests potential applications in other tauopathies, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. By addressing lysosomal dysfunction and tau pathology, AZP2006 represents a promising disease-modifying approach for PSP and other neurodegenerative disorders.",2025-03-27
40144621,Covert cerebrospinal fluid dynamics dysfunction: evolution from conventional to innovative therapies.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics disorders are intricately linked to diverse neurological pathologies, though they usually are mild and covert. Contemporary insights into glymphatic system function, particularly the CSF transport, drainage, and its role in clearing metabolic waste and toxic substances in both normal and pathological states, and the pivotal role of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in CSF-interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange, have established novel theoretical frameworks of subclinical CSF dynamics dysfunction, and have promoted the development of non-surgical therapeutic approaches for them simultaneously. This review comprehensively analyzes the advancement of non-surgical interventions for CSF dynamics disorders, emphasizing the transition from established methodologies to innovative approaches. Current non-surgical treatment strategies primarily encompass three directions: pharmacological therapy, physical therapy, and biological regulation therapy. In terms of pharmacological interventions, developments from traditional diuretics to novel small-molecule drugs show promising therapeutic potential. In physical therapy, innovative techniques such as lower body negative pressure, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and vagus nerve stimulation have provided new options for clinical practice. Meanwhile, biological regulation therapy, exemplified by recombinant VEGF-C administration, has established novel therapeutic paradigms. These therapeutic strategies have demonstrated potential in improving CSF dynamics and enhancing CSF waste elimination. Future research should focus on developing individualized treatment protocols, elucidating of therapeutic mechanisms, and assessing longitudinal outcomes. This will facilitate the development of more precise therapeutic strategies and exploration of optimized multimodal treatment combinations in handling the so-called convert CSF dynamics dysfunction.",2025-03-12
40139077,Inhibition of interleukin-1 signaling protects against Group B streptococcus-induced preterm birth and fetal loss in mice.,"Group B streptococcus is a common microbial agent associated with spontaneous preterm birth and fetal inflammatory response syndrome. In this study, we evaluated the utility of rytvela, a novel peptide antagonist of the interleukin-1 receptor, to suppress inflammatory activation, prolong gestation and improve neonatal outcomes induced in mice by Group B streptococcus. Pregnant mice were administered rytvela or PBS on gestation day 16.5, immediately prior and following surgical administration of heat-killed Group B streptococcus (hkGBS) or PBS into the uterine cavity. Treatment with rytvela prevented preterm delivery and alleviated fetal demise in utero and in the perinatal phase elicited by hkGBS. Compared to pups exposed to hkGBS alone, pups of dams co-administered rytvela exhibited substantially improved survival and growth through to weaning. Analysis by qPCR showed expression of inflammatory cytokine genes Il1b, Il6, Tnf, and Ifng in uterine tissues, and Il1b, Il6, and Tnf in fetal membranes, were stimulated by hkGBS and this increase was suppressed by co-administration of rytvela. Premature induction of uterine activation gene Ptgs2 in the myometrium was also attenuated by rytvela treatment. These data show that activation of IL1-mediated signaling in response to Group B streptococcus triggers an inflammatory cascade that causes preterm parturition and fetal inflammatory injury, and that rytvela can suppress inflammatory mediators to substantially improve pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Our findings add to accumulating evidence supporting clinical investigation of rytvela for fetal protection and delaying preterm birth.",2025-03-17
40138250,"Enhanced Antitumor Immunity by ASP1570, a Novel Diacylglycerol Kinase Zeta Inhibitor, Offers a Potential Novel Immunotherapy for Treating Cancer.","Studies of diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ) in DGKζ knockout mice have revealed its role as an intracellular immune checkpoint in T cells. Although enhancing antitumor immunity by pharmacological inhibition of DGKζ is desirable, selective DGKζ inhibitors for clinical use remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel, small-molecule, DGKζ inhibitor, ASP1570, which is currently under phase 1 development (NCT05083481), and characterize its effect on potential resistance mechanisms against approved immune checkpoint inhibitors in multiple immunosuppressive conditions: not only TGF-β, PGE2, adenosine, PD-1, but also CTLA-4 and TIGIT. Firstly, our findings indicated that ASP1570 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of DGKζ. Unexpectedly, we observed that DGKζ protein was degraded in cells treated with ASP1570 in a proteasome-dependent manner. ASP1570 enhanced T-cell activation with increased diacylglycerol downstream signaling and released anergic T cells from their hyporesponsive state. Further, ASP1570 restored T-cell functions suppressed by multiple immunosuppressive signals (TGF-β, PGE2, adenosine, PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT) and induced tumor growth inhibition in 2 types of syngeneic mouse models: anti-PD-1-antibody-sensitive MC38 and anti-PD-1-antibody-insensitive B16F1/F10. The antitumor efficacy of ASP1570 was cancelled by CD8+ T-cell depletion, indicating that its antitumor effect depends on CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell activation. Collectively, ASP1570 potentially improves antitumor efficacy in both anti-PD-1-therapy-resistant and anti-PD-1-therapy-responsive tumors by overcoming multiple immunosuppressive signals.",2025-03-26

40121226,Innovative peptide therapeutics targeting IL17RA to regulate inflammatory responses.,"Interleukin-17 receptor A (IL17RA) is a critical mediator of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and a key immune checkpoint in autoimmune diseases. While monoclonal antibodies targeting IL17RA have demonstrated clinical efficacy, their high costs, complexity in production, and lack of oral bioavailability present significant limitations. In response to these challenges, we developed AL-8(0), a novel peptide specifically designed to inhibit the IL17A-IL17RA signaling pathway. AL-8(0) was synthesized with high purity and systematically evaluated for its binding affinity and anti-inflammatory activity. Biophysical and cellular assays confirmed the peptide's strong affinity for IL17RA and its ability to inhibit inflammatory cytokine production in IL17RA-expressing monocyte-macrophages and keratinocytes. Moreover, its anti-inflammatory effects were com-parable to IL17RA-targeting monoclonal antibodies and were dependent on IL17RA expression, as demonstrated by experiments using IL17RA-deficient cells. These results underscore AL-8(0)'s potential as a targeted therapeutic for autoimmune diseases, offering a peptide-based alternative with lower antigenicity, improved scalability, and potential for oral administration. This study lays the groundwork for further development of AL-8(0) and similar peptides as innovative treatments for inflammatory disorders driven by the IL17A-IL17RA pathway.",2025-03-22
40118958,"Fluorofenidone attenuates choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet-induced metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis in mice.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a severe form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), involves hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. It can progress to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma without timely treatment. Current treatment options for MASH are limited. This study explores the therapeutic effects of fluorofenidone (AKF-PD), a novel small-molecule compound with antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties, on MASH in mouse model. Mice fed a choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) were treated with AKF-PD, resulting in reduced serum ALT, AST, hepatic lipid accumulation, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. Network pharmacology and RNA-sequencing analyses suggested that AKF-PD influenced multiple metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrosis-related pathways. Further experiments verified that AKF-PD activated hepatic AMPK signaling, leading to the inhibition of the downstream SREBF1/SCD1 pathway and the activation of autophagy. Additionally, AKF-PD suppressed the expression of various inflammatory factors, reduced macrophage infiltration, and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, AKF-PD attenuated liver fibrosis by inhibiting TGFβ1/SMAD signaling. In conclusion, this study reveals that AKF-PD effectively decreases hepatic lipid accumulation, liver inflammation and fibrosis in a CDAHFD-induced MASH model, positioning AKF-PD as a promising candidate for the treatment of MASH.",2025-03-21
40118325,A novel adenosine 2A receptor antagonist HZ-086 enhances the efficiency of immunotherapy and alleviates the acquired resistance to PD-L1 by restoration of T cell functions.,"Immunotherapy faces significant challenges due to low clinical response rates and immune escape mechanisms, which ultimately lead to drug resistance. Previous studies suggest that adenosine-2A receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) signaling plays a critical role in immunosuppression and immune escape. However, no potent and selective A<sub>2A</sub>R inhibitors are currently available for clinical use to address immunotherapy resistance in tumors. In this study, we identified a novel small molecule compound, HZ-086, as a potent and selective inhibitor of A<sub>2A</sub>R. HZ-086 restored the activation of T-cell signaling which is suppressed by adenosine analogs in vitro. Additionally, HZ-086 enhanced T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, increased the secretion of cytokines for antitumor and subsequently inhibited growth of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, HZ-086 inhibited tumor growth, enhances anti-tumor capacity, and reversed PD-L1 resistance in vivo. When combined with FD-L1, a PD-L1 small molecule inhibitor discovered by our lab, HZ-086 achieved over 80 % tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and restored immune response in anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody-resistant tumors. This combination treatment also promoted the infiltration and activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment. Our findings demonstrate that adenosine-A<sub>2A</sub>R signaling mediates resistance to immunotherapy and discover a novel potent and selective A<sub>2A</sub>R inhibitor with high efficacy in enhancing antitumor immune responses and reversing PD-L1 resistance. The combination of A<sub>2A</sub>R inhibitor and PD-L1 inhibitor represents a promising therapeutic strategy for antitumor therapy.",2025-03-19

The pseudo-peptide [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-BQ0413 demonstrated high affinity and specificity to PSMA in preclinical evaluation. The purpose of this study was to clinically evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single administration of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-BQ0413 as well as study its biodistribution using SPECT to estimate dosimetry. [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-BQ0413 was studied in a single-center diagnostic Phase I open-label exploratory study. Whole-body planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT imaging were performed 2, 4, and 6 h after administration of 50, 100, or 150 μg (680 ± 140 MBq) of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-BQ0413 in five PCa patients per injected mass (NCT05839990). All injections of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-BQ0413 were well tolerated. The elimination of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-BQ0413 was predominantly renal. The stable physiological uptake of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-BQ0413 was observed in the lacrimal and salivary glands, liver, spleen, and kidneys for all tested peptide-injected masses. The average effective doses were 0.007 ± 0.001, 0.0049 ± 0.0003, and 0.0062 ± 0.0008 mSv/MBq for 50, 100, and 150 μg/injection, respectively. The radionuclide-associated dose burden per patient was 4-7 mSv/study for the given activity. Uptake of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-BQ0413 in primary tumors was identified in all patients and increased with the peptide-injected mass. Uptake in lymph nodes and bone metastases was the highest at 100 μg/injected mass.

40107018,Thiosulphate sulfurtransferase: Biological roles and therapeutic potential.,"Mitochondria are central to eukaryotic cell function, driving energy production, intermediary metabolism, and cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of mitochondrial function often results in oxidative stress, a hallmark of numerous diseases, underscoring the critical need for maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Among mitochondrial enzymes, thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) has emerged as a key regulator of sulfur metabolism, redox balance, and Fe-S protein maintenance. Beyond its well-known role in cyanide detoxification, TST facilitates hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) metabolism by catalyzing the transfer of sulfur from persulfides (R-SSH) to thiosulfate (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), promoting H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation and preventing its toxic accumulation. Additionally, TST contributes to the thiol-dependent antioxidant system by regulating reactive sulfur species and sustaining mitochondrial functionality through its role in sulfide-driven bioenergetics. This review highlights the biochemical and therapeutic significance of TST in mitochondrial and cellular health, emphasizing its protective roles in diseases associated with oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Dysregulation of TST has been implicated in diverse pathologies, including specific metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, cardiovascular conditions, kidney dysfunction, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. These associations underline TST's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Therapeutic strategies to activate the TST pathway are explored, with a focus on sodium thiosulfate (STS), novel small molecule (Hit 2), and recombinant hTST protein. STS, an FDA-approved compound, has demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects across multiple preclinical models, mitigating oxidative damage and improving mitochondrial integrity. A slow-release oral formulation of STS is under development, offering promise for expanding its clinical applications. Small molecule activators like Hit 2 and hTST protein have shown efficacy in enhancing mitochondrial respiration and reducing oxidative stress, though both reagents need further in vitro and in vivo investigations. Despite promising advancements, TST-based therapies remain underexplored. Future research should focus on leveraging TST's interplay with pathways like NRF2 signaling, investigating its broader protective roles in cellular health, and developing targeted interventions. Enhancing TST activity represents an innovative therapeutic approach for addressing mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and their associated pathologies, offering new hope for the treatment of diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.",2025-03-14
40105966,A novel peptide targeting CCR7 inhibits tumor cell lymph node metastasis.,"Lymph nodes are the most common metastasis sites for tumor cells, which are intimately linked to patient prognosis. It has been reported that cancer cells can upregulate CC Chemokine Receptor 7 (CCR7) expression and hijack its normal functions, enabling them to migrate along the gradient of CCL19 and CCL21 toward the lymph nodes and colonies as the initial stage of distant metastasis. In tumor patients, the metastatic tumor in the lymph nodes exhibited higher expression of CCR7, as well as inhibitory immune checkpoints PD-1, LAG-3, and TIM-3 compared to the primary tumors with the analysis of TCGA and GEO databases. Also, in mouse tumor model, tumor cells with elevated CCR7 expression were more susceptible to develop popliteal lymph node metastasis. Subsequently, we successfully identified a CCR7 binding peptide TC6 by phage display biopanning, which specifically blocks the interaction of CCR7/CCL19 and CCR7/CCL21. Further, the D-amino acids were introduced to substitute the N- and C-terminus of TC6 peptide to obtain the proteolysis-resistant TC6-D3 peptide, which decreased tumor cell migration in vitro via ERK1/2 pathway and inhibited tumor growth and lymph nodes metastasis in vivo, as well as effectively restored T cells cytotoxicity in both primary tumors and lymph nodes. In conclusion, CCR7 promoted tumor cell metastasis to lymph node and inhibited the anti-tumor immune responses in lymph nodes. Specific blockade of the CCR7 pathway with TC6-D3 peptide can significantly reduce lymph node tumor burden, promoting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in primary tumors, meanwhile, enhancing anti-tumor immune responses in lymph nodes.",2025-03-19

40096611,Embryonic reprogramming of the tumor vasculature reveals targets for cancer therapy.,"A sustained blood supply is critical for tumor growth, as it delivers the nutrients and oxygen required for development. Targeting of blood vessel formation via immunotherapies is an area of great importance. Knowing that certain embryonic genes, such as carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) and oncofetal fibronectin, become reexpressed in malignant transformation, we hypothesized that a similar phenomenon holds true for tumor endothelial cells (TECs) as well. An approach for identification of highly selective tumor endothelial markers was conducted to develop targeted antiangiogenic immunotherapies. We first queried the transcriptome that is present during embryo development. We then performed a systematic search for genes selectively expressed in the mouse embryo at days E11 and E18, as compared to the transcriptome of the adult mouse. Subsequently, we queried for expression of these embryonic genes in sorted murine TECs. This approach identified among others the tumor endothelial antigens fibrillin-2 (Fbn2), elastin microfibril interface-located protein 2 (Emilin2) as well as the tumor endothelial antigens lysyl oxidase (Lox) and serine/cysteine protease inhibitor, clade E, member 1 (Serpine1; Pai-1). For these selected genes, functional involvement in angiogenesis was confirmed in in vitro bioassays. We subsequently used iBoost conjugate vaccine technology to develop vaccines against the selected targets. For all four targets, vaccination readily induced target-specific antibody responses in mice, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. Access to highly specific tumor endothelial markers provides opportunities for direct targeting of the tumor vasculature with high specificity, without affecting healthy vasculature.",2025-03-17
40092780,The Novel Long-Acting Peptide S6-FA Attenuates Liver Fibrosis In Vitro and In Vivo.,"Liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, there is no effective drug for liver fibrosis. The peptide 6 (T6) is an endogenous peptide derived from human intrauterine adhesion tissues and has antifibrotic potential. Here, to improve the long-term efficacy and activity of T6, we conducted the rational modified of T6 through studying structure-activity, and synthesized a series of analogues. Among them, S6 and S6-FA exhibited optimal antihepatic fibrosis activity, and S6-FA had a stronger long-acting effect than T6 and S6. The two analogues inhibited the expression of α-SMA and Collagen 1 in TGF-β-induced LX2 cells model and CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced mouse model of liver fibrosis. Besides, we discovered that S6 and S6-FA remarkably reduced the AST and ALT serum levels. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that analogues inhibited liver fibrosis through inhibiting Erk, Smad and P65 pathways. This study provided that the novel peptide S6 and S6-FA is potential candidate compounds for treating liver fibrosis.",2025-02-27
40088962,Dual targeting of the mitochondrial Lon peptidase 1 and the chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity as a potential therapeutic strategy in malignant astrocytoma models.,"Malignant astrocytomas are aggressive primary brain tumors characterized by extensive hypoxia-induced, mitochondria-dependent changes such as altered respiration, increased chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) proteasome activity, decreased apoptosis, drug resistance, stemness, and increased invasiveness. Mitochondrial Lon Peptidase 1 (LonP1) overexpression and increased CT-L proteasome activity are biomarkers of an aggressive high-grade phenotype and found to be associated with recurrence and poor patient survival. In preclinical models, small molecule agents targeting either LonP1 or the proteasome CT-L activity have anti-astrocytoma activity. Here, we present evidence that the dual inhibition of LonP1 and CT-L proteasome activity effectively induces ROS production, leading to apoptosis in malignant astrocytoma established cell lines and patient-derived glioma stem cell-like cultures. We also evaluated a novel small molecule, BT317, derived from the coumarinic compound 4 (CC4) using structure-activity modeling, which we found to inhibit both LonP1 and CT-L proteasome activity. Using gain- and loss-of-function genetic models, we discovered that LonP1 is both necessary and sufficient to drive BT317 drug sensitivity in established and patient-derived glioma stem-like cells by generating ROS and inducing apoptosis. In vitro, BT317 had activity as a single agent but, more importantly, enhanced synergy with the standard of care commonly used chemotherapeutic temozolomide (TMZ). In an orthotopic xenograft astrocytoma model, BT317 crossed the blood-brain barrier, showed selective activity at the tumor site, and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy as a single agent and combined with TMZ. BT317 defines an emerging class of LonP1 and CT-L inhibitors that exhibited promising anti-tumor activity and could be a potential candidate for malignant astrocytoma therapeutics. SIMPLE SUMMARY: Malignant astrocytoma patients have poor clinical outcomes, and novel treatments are needed to limit tumor recurrence and improve their overall survival. These tumors have a malignant phenotype mediated by altered mitochondrial metabolism, abnormal protein processing, and adaptation to hypoxia. We have previously published that astrocytomas are especially vulnerable to proteasome inhibitors as well as to inhibitors of the mitochondrial Lon Peptidase 1 (LonP1), but the effect of combining the two strategies has not been reported. Here, we present evidence that the dual inhibition of LonP1 and Chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) proteasome activity effectively induces cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to apoptosis in malignant astrocytoma established cell lines and patient-derived glioma stem cell-like cultures. We developed BT317, a small molecule dual inhibitor, which crosses the blood-brain barrier and shows strong synergy with the standard of care, temozolomide (TMZ), in the astrocytoma cell lines independent of their isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) profile and in an orthotopic glioma murine model. This preclinical study demonstrated the potential of dual LonP1 and CT-L proteasome inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for malignant astrocytoma and provides insight for future clinical translational studies alone or in combination with other chemotherapies.",2025-03-13
40076833,1-Pyrene Carboxylic Acid: An Internalization Enhancer for Short Oligoarginines.,"Getting through the cell membrane is challenging, and transporting a therapeutic agent while entering the cell is even more complicated. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are valuable tools for solving this problem, although they have drawbacks. In this work, the synthesis and investigation of efficient CPPs are described. We used an aromatic group, 1-pyrene carboxylic acid (PCA), to enhance internalization. We designed oligoarginines to investigate the effect of PCA in different positions at the <i>N</i>-terminus or in the side chain. Our novel peptide derivatives showed remarkable internalization on tumor cell lines, and more than one endocytic pathway plays a role in their internalization mechanism. With this modification, there is an opportunity to design short oligoarginines that can rival well-known CPPs like octaarginine in internalization.",2025-02-28

40057827,Pro-inflammatory microglia-targeted peptide therapy ameliorates neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in mice.,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is aggravated by intracerebral inflammation. As pro-inflammatory microglia in the brain become activated in this condition, we aimed to establish a novel peptide therapy for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy by investigating the therapeutic effects of pro-inflammatory microglial depletion. MG1 homing peptide, which selectively targets and binds pro-inflammatory microglia, was conjugated with the pro-apoptotic peptide <sub>D</sub>[KLAKLAK]<sub>2</sub> (KLA), creating MG1-KLA. After confirming that MG1-KLA selectively bound pro-inflammatory microglia and decreased cell viability by inducing apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, the in vivo therapeutic effect of MG1-KLA was assessed following intracerebroventricular injection in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy model mice through histological, behavioral, and biochemical analyses. In these mice, MG1-KLA selectively bound to microglia and induced their apoptosis. Brain atrophy was significantly suppressed in the mice treated with MG1-KLA compared with non-treated mice. Additionally, motor function and locomotor hyperactivity were improved in mice treated with MG1-KLA compared with non-treated mice. Gene expression analysis further revealed that pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was downregulated in mice treated with MG1-KLA compared with non-treated mice. These findings suggest that novel MG1-KLA peptide therapy has high potential for treating neonatal patients with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy through the selective induction of apoptosis in pro-inflammatory microglia.",2025-03-08

40051947,Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Children: Current Diagnosis and Treatment Strategies.,"Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, has emerged as a significant global health challenge with rising incidence rates. Unlike adult inflammatory bowel disease, PIBD presents complexities, including growth impairment, nutritional deficiencies, and psychosocial challenges that necessitate tailored management strategies. This article reviews current diagnostic and emerging treatment strategies to highlight the evolution from traditional therapies such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators to advanced biologic agents like infliximab and adalimumab. Emerging biological therapies, including vedolizumab and ustekinumab, show promise, while novel small molecule therapies such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are under investigation for potential use in the pediatric population. Supportive treatments, including exclusive enteral nutrition, modified diets, and probiotics, play a critical role in comprehensive disease management. Stem cell therapy and fecal microbiota transplant represent innovative approaches still under clinical evaluation. The review underscores the significance of holistic care, incorporating mind-body interventions and psychosocial support to improve patient quality of life. Key challenges persist, such as infection risks associated with long-term biological therapy use, gaps in pediatric-specific guidelines, and the limited inclusion of children in clinical trials. Future recommendations emphasize the importance of structured transition programs bridging pediatric and adult care, regular updates to clinical guidelines, and the integration of precision medicine to personalize treatment plans. Continued research and collaboration are essential for advancing the understanding and management of PIBD, ensuring that pediatric patients benefit from the most effective, evidence-based care available.",2025-02-03

40035591,Microenvironment-Regulated Hydrogels Prepared with a Brand-New Small Molecule Cross-Linker for Stepwise Treatment of Myocardial Infarction.,"Despite the development of many injectable hydrogels intended for the repair of myocardial infarction (MI), their effectiveness is often compromised because they target merely one or two phases of MI's pathological progression. Here, a multifunctional hydrogel delivery platform is prepared with a brand-new small molecule cross-linker for stepwise treatment of MI. The synthesis and reporting of a novel small-molecule phenylboronic acid cross-linker ((N(BA)<sub>3</sub>)) with a precise molecular structure is conducted for the first time, and it is successfully utilized with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) dopamine to prepare a hydrogel with infarct microenvironmental responsiveness and anti-oxidant. Further, considering the multistage of MI repair, hydrogel contains both hyperoside bioactive nanoparticles (EGCG@Hyp&Arg NPs) and PLGA microspheres loaded with galunisertib (PLGA@Gal Ms). The EGCG@Hyp&Arg NPs are rapidly released and demonstrate anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenesis effects, while in the long term, Gal is released from the PLGA@Gal Ms to inhibit myocardial fibrosis and improve cardiac function. Results from both in vitro and in vivo studies reveal that the hydrogel is engineered with programmed capabilities for anti-oxidation, reducing inflammation, promoting new blood vessel formation, and inhibiting fibrosis, thereby significantly enhancing heart function post-MI. Overall, this multifunctional hydrogel delivery platform has great potential for application as a therapeutic strategy for MI.",2025-03-04

40033556,Discovery of Potent and Selective MNK Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Leukemia.,"MNK activity is regulated by the p38 and Erk MAPK pathways. Phosphorylation of MNK leads to its activation and binding to the eIF4G/eIF4E complex. MNK then phosphorylates eIF4E at Ser209, whose activation is associated with oncogene translation, leading to tumorigenesis. Given this important role for eIF4E in tumorigenesis, MNK inhibition with novel small molecule inhibitors could be a promising strategy to combat AML, which continues to be an area of unmet medical need. Here, we report the medicinal optimization of a series of novel inhibitors and their evaluation of their effects on eIF4E and leukemia cell viability. We discovered a class of ether-containing compounds with a high MNK1/2 selectivity. These MNK inhibitors show good potency in reducing cell viability and colony formation and have desirable pharmacokinetic properties. X-ray cocrystallization was accomplished to confirm the binding mode of our inhibitors and aid in future optimization.",2025-03-04
40027732,"Long-Term Functional Rescue of Trauma-Induced Vision Loss by a Novel, Small Molecule TrkB Activator.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor promotes neuronal growth and survival following an injury. However, its short half-life and pleiotropic effects limit the clinical use of BDNF as a therapy in neurodegenerative disorders. Identification of novel and selective TrkB activators may ameliorate the damage caused to retinal neurons during eye-related injuries, and may reduce adverse visual outcomes associated with visual trauma. We previously described a selective TrkB agonist, N-[2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]-2-oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC), that reduces the decline in visual function in a mouse model of ocular trauma (1). Using the lead optimization approach, we subsequently synthesized a fluoropyridine analog of HIOC, 2-fluoro-N-(2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl) nicotinamide (HIFN), which also successfully activates TrkB. HIFN is a more potent TrkB activator than the parent compound, HIOC. Further, treatment with HIFN demonstrated neuroprotection in an animal model of overpressure ocular blast injury, ameliorating blast-related visual functional decline. Mice treated with HIFN had better visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and retinal function supported by enhanced survival of retinal ganglion cells compared to vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, HIFN exhibited better protective effects than HIOC. The therapeutic effects of HIFN were attributed to TrkB activation, as blocking the receptor with a selective receptor antagonist (ANA-12) abrogated the neuroprotection.

40027648,Synergistic RAS-MAPK and AKT Activation in MYC-Driven Tumors via Adjacent PVT1 Rearrangements.,"MYC-driven (MYC+) cancers are aggressive and often fatal. MYC dysregulation is a key event in these cancers, but overexpression of MYC alone is not always enough to cause cancer. <i>Plasmocytoma Variant Translocation 1</i> (<i>PVT1</i>), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) adjacent to MYC on chromosome 8 is a rearrangement hotspot in many MYC+ cancers. In addition to being co-amplified with MYC, the genomic rearrangement at PVT1 involves translocation, which has had obscure functional consequences. We report that translocation at the PVT1 locus cause asymmetric enrichment of 5'-PVT1 and loss of 3'-PVT1. Despite being classified as a non-coding RNA, the retained 5' region of PVT1 generates a circular RNA (CircPVT1) that codes for the novel peptide we call Firefox (FFX). FFX augments AKT signaling and synergistically activates MYC and mTORC1 in these cells. Further, the 3' end of PVT1, which is lost during the translocation, codes for a tumor-suppressing micropeptide we named as Honeybadger (HNB). We demonstrate that HNB interacts with KRAS and disrupts the activation of KRAS effectors. Loss of HNB leads to activation of RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, and enhances MYC stability by promoting phosphorylation of MYC at Ser<sup>62</sup>. These findings identify PVT1 as a critical node that synchronizes MYC, AKT, and RAS-MAPK activities in cancer. Our study thus identifies a key mechanism by which rearrangements at the PVT1 locus activate additional oncogenic pathways that synergize with MYC to exacerbate the aggressiveness of MYC+ cancers. This newfound understanding explains the poor prognosis associated with MYC+ cancers and offers potential therapeutic targets that could be leveraged in treatment strategies for these cancers.",2025-02-22
40023517,High-throughput screening identifies a novel small-molecule modulator of Hsp70 that selectively enhances ubiquitination and degradation of misfolded neuronal NO synthase.,"The Hsp90 and Hsp70 chaperones act as a protein quality control system for several hundred client proteins, including many implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. Hsp90 and Hsp70 are widely thought to be important drug targets. Although many structurally distinct compounds have been developed to target Hsp90, relatively few are known to target Hsp70 and even fewer have been tested in protein quality control systems. To address this, we describe a high-throughput thermal shift-based screen to find compounds that bind and stabilize Hsp70 and then employ assays with misfolded forms of a well-established client protein, neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), to identify compounds that enhance ubiquitination of client proteins. The ubiquitination assay employed a quantitative ELISA method to measure Hsp70:CHIP-dependent ubiquitination of heme-deficient nNOS, which is a model of a misfolded client, in reaction mixtures containing purified E1, E2, Hsp70, CHIP, and ubiquitin. We screened 44,447 molecules from the Maybridge and ChemDiv libraries and found one compound, protein folding disease compound 15 (PFD-15), that enhanced in vitro nNOS ubiquitination with an EC<sub>50</sub> of approximately 8 μM. PFD-15 was tested in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with a C331A nNOS, a mutation that makes nNOS a preferred client protein for ubiquitination. In this model, PFD-15 decreased steady-state levels of C331A nNOS, but not the wild-type nNOS, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by a process attenuated by lactacystin, an inhibitor to the proteasome. PFD-15 appears to enhance binding of Hsp70 and CHIP to client proteins without interference of protein quality control mechanisms, enabling the selective clearance of misfolded proteins. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: There are few treatment options for neurodegenerative diseases, which are widely thought to be caused by formation of toxic misfolded proteins. One novel approach is to enhance the Hsp90/Hsp70 protein quality control machinery to remove these misfolded proteins. Targeting Hsp70 may have advantages over targeting Hsp90, but fewer compounds targeting Hsp70 have been developed relative to those for Hsp90. The current study provides a novel approach to enhance the number of compounds targeting the Hsp70's role in protein quality control.",2024-12-12

40006613,Novel Peptide-Modified Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 Nanoparticles with pH-Sensitive Release of Doxorubicin for Targeted Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.,"<b>Background</b>: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the common malignant tumors. Chemotherapeutic agents represented by doxorubicin (DOX) are common adjuvant therapies for patients with advanced CRC. However, DOX suffers from dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and myelosuppression due to a lack of targeting and specificity, which severely limits its clinical application. <b>Methods</b>: Herein, we constructed a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) modified by a novel peptide (LT peptide) to deliver the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) for the targeted treatment of CRC. <b>Results</b>: In this study, LT-PEG@DOX@ZIF-8 nanoparticles were prepared by a simple method with suitable particle size and zeta potential, which were also capable of pH-responsive drug release. In vitro assays exhibited that LT-PEG@DOX@ZIF-8 nanoparticles were effectively taken up by C26 cells, significantly inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, in mice models with colorectal tumors, LT-PEG@DOX@ZIF-8 nanoparticles also displayed specific tumor aggregation and exerted anti-tumor effects to prolong the survival of the mice. <b>Conclusions</b>: In conclusion, LT-PEG@DOX@ZIF-8 provides a promising strategy for the delivery of DOX to effectively treat CRC.",2025-02-13
39995466,Efficacy of <i>Larimichthys crocea</i> TASOR protein-derived peptide FAM286 against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.,"<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) is a major foodborne pathogen, could lead cause of intestinal infections in humans. Antimicrobial peptides, as emerging antimicrobial agents, are gradually replacing traditional agents due to their highly effective and safe antimicrobial activity. In this study, a novel peptide, designated as FAM286, was identified from TASOR protein of <i>Larimichthys crocea</i>, which had a strong antimicrobial activity against <i>S. aureus</i> with a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 3.9 μg/mL and completed bacteria killing by treatment for 1.5 h. The FAM286 could increase the permeability and disrupt the integrity of cell membranes. The cell showed aggregation phenomenon and entered the apoptosis stage. In addition, the non-bactericidal concentration of FAM286 could effectively inhibit the formation of biofilm and remove mature biofilm. Molecular docking experiments further verified the binding sites of FAM286 to <i>S. aureus</i> biofilm proteins SarA, AgrA, and Hld. FAM286 could also bind the bacterial DNA in an embedded manner, disrupting the structure of DNA and leading to the death of bacteria. This study comprehensively evaluated the antimicrobial mechanism of the FAM286 against <i>S. aureus</i> and provided a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of <i>S. aureus</i>.",2025-02-03
39993525,A novel spider toxin as a selective antagonist of the Kv1 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels through gating modulation.,"Members of the voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily (Kv1) are essential for the nervous and immune systems, necessitating novel modulators and deeper insights into their structure-function relationships. While all known peptide inhibitors targeting Kv1 channels are pore blockers, we identified MrVIII (κ-HxTx-MrVIII), a novel peptide toxin from the venom of spider Macrothele raveni, as the first voltage-gating modifier antagonist with selective activity against Kv1 channels. MrVIII exhibits high-affinity inhibition of Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.5, and Kv1.6, completely suppressing their currents. By contrast, it selectively inhibits the initial activation phase of Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and Kv1.7 with lower affinity, reflecting its differential subtype modulation. Gating current analyses revealed that MrVIII stabilizes the voltage sensor of Kv1 channels in its resting state, thereby preventing activation upon depolarization. The interaction between MrVIII and Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and Kv1.7 is unstable, with the voltage sensor of Kv1.7, initially stabilized in the resting state by the toxin, potentially transitioning back to an activated state, influenced by the strength and duration of depolarization. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified the S3-S4 region as the critical interaction region, with the conserved residue Y339 (in Kv1.3) serving as a key binding site across subtypes. Additionally, the contribution of E283 and T286 in Kv1.1 and A256 in Kv1.7 are key residues in defining channel's pattern in inhibition by MrVIII, compared to Kv1.3. These findings establish MrVIII as a valuable molecular tool for studying Kv1 channels, offering potential pathways for drug development and therapeutic applications.",2025-02-22
39992105,"A phase I, single-center, randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study to evaluate the drug-drug interaction between ZSP1273 and oseltamivir in healthy Chinese subjects.","ZSP1273 is a novel small-molecule anti-influenza drug that targets the RNA polymerase PB2 subunit, while oseltamivir is the first-line medication that inhibits neuraminidase. ZSP1273 showed high efficacy against human influenza viruses both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, including oseltamivir-resistant strains <i>in vitro</i>. In future clinical applications, the combination of these two antiviral drugs with different mechanisms can reduce the potential for antiviral resistance that may arise from monotherapy. To evaluate the drug-drug interaction between ZSP1273 and oseltamivir by the pharmacokinetics and safety of co-administration in healthy subjects, a phase I, single-center, randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study was conducted. Thirty-six subjects enrolled were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into three crossover treatment sequences with oral administration detailed as follows: treatment A: ZSP1273 tablets 600 mg once daily (QD) for 5 days; treatment B: oseltamivir capsules 75 mg twice daily (BID) for 5 days; treatment C: ZSP1273 tablets 600 mg once daily (QD) + oseltamivir capsules 75 mg twice daily (BID) for 5 days. Plasma samples were collected from all subjects at scheduled time points after drug administration to measure the plasma concentrations of ZSP1273, oseltamivir, and its active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate, for pharmacokinetic analysis. Compared with monotherapy, the geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) of C<sub>max,ss</sub>, AUC<sub>0-t,ss</sub>, AUC<sub>0-τ,ss</sub>, and AUC<sub>0-∞,ss</sub> for ZSP1273 after co-administration were all within the ineffective boundary range of 80% to 125%, supporting that no drug-drug interaction occurs with ZSP1273. After co-administration, the AUC<sub>0-t,ss</sub>, AUC<sub>0-τ,ss</sub>, and AUC<sub>0-∞,ss</sub> of oseltamivir were all within 80% to 125%, while C<sub>max,ss</sub> decreased by 39.9%. The pharmacokinetic parameters above of oseltamivir carboxylate remained within 80%-125%, except only the lower bound of the 90% CI for C<sub>max,ss</sub> slightly below 80% (77.0%). Considering the rapid metabolism of oseltamivir into the active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate and the minor impact of co-administration on the pharmacokinetic parameters of oseltamivir carboxylate, it is believed that no clinically significant drug-drug interaction was observed with the combination of these two drugs. During the trial, the safety and tolerability of both combination therapy and monotherapy were good, with no increased safety risks observed from the combination therapy.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT05108051.",2025-02-24
39985567,STM2457 impairs the proliferation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by activating DNA damage response through ATM-Chk2 axis.,"METTL3 has been proven to play an important role in the proliferation of Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, we focused on investigating the therapeutic role and molecular mechanism of STM2457 in ESCC, which is a novel small-molecule inhibitor of METTL3. The effect of STM2457 on ESCC was evaluated using ESCC cell lines by the cell viability measurement, cloning formation assay, scratching assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry techniques. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism study was employed to evaluate by RT-qPCR, Western blotting, proteomics analysis, comet assay, etc. Additionally, the anticancer effect of STM2457 was carried out by nude mice tumor xenograft in vivo. This study showed STM2457 could significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells, which promoted G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manners in vitro. Moreover, proteomics analysis suggested the important role of ATM in action mechanism of STM2457. Further studies showed that STM2457 may activate DNA damage response and the expression of ATM, p-ATM, p-Chk2, and γ-H2AX protein in ATM-Chk2 pathway. Intriguingly, ATM inhibitor CGK-733 and knocking down ATM significantly reduced the expression of ATM in Eca109 and KYSE150 cells treated with STM2457. Importantly, STM2457 significantly upregulated the expression of ATM and γ-H2AX protein and inhibited the growth of ESCC in vivo. Finally, STM2457 combined with PTX could also significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration ability of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells by targeting the ATM-mediated DDR pathway. In tumor-bearing nude mice model, STM2457 combined with Paclitaxel can inhibit the growth of ESCC and increased the expression of ATM and γ-H2AX protein. These findings revealed ATM-Chk2 pathway is a promising therapeutic target for STM2457 to effectively inhibit the proliferation of ESCC.",2025-02-22
39971241,The novel peptide DBCH reduces LPS-stimulated NF-κB/MAPK signaling in BV-2 microglia and ameliorates cognitive impairment in scopolamine-treated mice by modulating BDNF/CREB.,"Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation significantly impacts cognitive impairment, and modulating neuroinflammatory responses has emerged as a promising target for treatment. However, the specific role of microglial-mediated neuroinflammation in cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. In our continuous endeavors to seek potent anti-Alzheimer's agents, we recently synthesized and developed a series of peptidomimetic compounds, including dipeptide-68 bis-cyclohexylpropyl histidinamide (DBCH), derived from a caryopsis-1 peptide that has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties in various infectious diseases. Among the bioactive peptides synthesized, DBCH exhibited good neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activity and high potency. Therefore, in this study, the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of DBCH were assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells and a scopolamine-induced C57BL/6 N amnesic mouse model. In the in vitro study, DBCH effectively suppressed the production and expression of nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 microglial cells stimulated with LPS. Furthermore, it effectively inhibited the LPS-triggered phosphorylation and activation of NF-κB/MAPK signaling and modulated inflammatory mediators, including iNOS and COX-2, in BV-2 microglial cells. In vivo results showed that DBCH administration of 5 or 10 mg/kg improved spatial memory learning and cognitive function in scopolamine-induced amnesic mice. Furthermore, DBCH treatment upregulated phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein (p-CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and downregulated the inflammatory response. Overall, DBCH effectively prevented both scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. Our research findings suggest that DBCH may serve as a medication for cognitive decline associated with AD.",2025-02-18

39947256,Therapeutic PCSK9 targeting: Inside versus outside the hepatocyte?,"As a major regulator of LDL receptor (LDLR) activity and thus of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) represents an obvious therapeutic target for lipid lowering. The PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, are human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that act outside the cell by complexing circulating PCSK9 and thus preventing its binding to the LDLR. In contrast, inclisiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA), inhibits hepatic synthesis of PCSK9, thereby resulting in reduced amounts of the protein inside and outside the cell. Both approaches result in decreased plasma LDL-C concentrations and improved cardiovascular outcomes. Marginally superior LDL-C reduction (≈ 60 %) is achieved with mAbs as compared to the siRNA (≈ 50 %); head-to-head comparisons are required to confirm between-class differences in efficacy. Both drug classes have shown variability in LDL-C lowering response between individuals in waterfall analyses. Whereas mAb-mediated inhibition leads to a compensatory increase in plasma PCSK9 levels, siRNA treatment reduces them. These agents differ in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features, which may translate into distinct clinical opportunities under acute (e.g. acute coronary syndromes) as compared to chronic conditions. Both drug classes provide additional reduction in LDL-C levels (up to 50 %) beyond those achieved with statin therapy, facilitating attainment of guideline-recommended LDL-C goals in high and very high-risk patients. Additional PCSK9 inhibitors, including an oral macrocyclic peptide, a small PCSK9 binding protein and a novel small molecule, plus hepatic gene editing of PCSK9, are under development. This review critically appraises pharmacological strategies to target PCSK9 either inside or outside the cell.",2025-02-11
39933078,Preliminary Study of a Novel <sup>68</sup>Ga-Labeled Probe Targeting Neuropilin-1 for Tumor Diagnosis.,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a transmembrane protein related to tumor progression and invasion, presents potential as a prospective biomarker for tumor diagnosis and therapy. Positron emission tomography (PET) is acknowledged as an ideal modality for accurately monitoring NRP-1 expression <i>in vivo</i> due to its superior sensitivity and resolution. In this study, a novel peptide-based PET imaging probe, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NEP, was successfully developed for specifically visualizing NRP-1 expression in tumors. The probe was prepared with a radiochemical yield (RCY) and radiochemical purity (RCP) greater than 95%, a molar activity of 13.28 ± 0.97 GBq/μmol, and a lipid-water partition coefficient (log <i>P</i>) of -2.20 ± 0.13. <i>In vitro</i> stability assay showed that the probe possessed sufficient stability for biological evaluation. The cellular uptake of the probe in U87 and A549 cells (4.91 ± 0.14 and 4.58 ± 0.40%AD) with high expression of NRP-1 was higher than that observed in NRP-1 negative cells HCT116 and NCI-H1299 (2.84 ± 0.23 and 1.76 ± 0.25%AD) at 1 h. <i>In vivo</i> PET imaging revealed that the maximum tumor uptake of the probe in U87 (7.20 ± 1.03%ID/mL) and A549 (5.90 ± 0.57%ID/mL) tumor-bearing mice was also markedly higher compared to that in HCT116 (3.09 ± 0.43%ID/mL) and NCI-H1299 (2.90 ± 0.70%ID/mL) tumor-bearing mice. <i>Ex vivo</i> analysis further confirmed the targeting specificity of the probe [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NEP for NRP-1. These results suggest that [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NEP could serve as a promising PET imaging probe for the diagnosis of NRP-1 positive tumors.",2025-02-11
39931696,Computer aided design of inhibitor molecules against Vpr protein from different HIV-1 subtypes.,"HIV-1 is a retrovirus that affects the human immune system and consequently leads to the development of AIDS. The high mutation rate in HIV-1 produces different subtypes which underscores the development of new therapeutics against it. This study aims to develop a novel small molecule that can be used as a potential inhibitor against the Vpr protein of all the subtypes of HIV-1. The druggable pockets of the Vpr protein of each subtype were identified and the conformational stability of these pockets was studied. The structure-based Drug Design method was used to design small molecules against the high-scoring pocket from each subtype individually using AutoGrow4 software. Molecules with strong binding affinity were selected from each subtype individually and binding affinity was checked for all the subtypes. Considering druggability and ADMET properties, we have identified two novel molecules that act as potential Vpr protein inhibitors. Both the molecules were shown to form stable complexes with the Vpr proteins of all the subtypes. The biological activity of both molecules was examined using DFT calculation. This study may provide some insight into developing of new therapies in HIV-1 treatment by interrupting protein-protein interaction.",2025-02-08
39929578,Biological and therapeutic significance of targeting NLRP3 inflammasome in the brain and the current efforts to develop brain-penetrant inhibitors.,"NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, a pivotal regulator of the innate immune system, orchestrates inflammatory responses implicated in neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. Over the past 20 years, the exploration of NLRP3 activation pathways has advanced significantly. Upon NLRP3 activation, it initiates the formation of a cytosolic multiprotein complex known as the inflammasome. This complex activates caspase-1, which then processes proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and leads to gasdermin-mediated cell death, pyroptosis. Structural insights into NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation have spurred development of novel small molecule inhibitors targeting this pathway, aiming to mitigate excessive inflammation without compromising immune surveillance. The initial NLRP3 inhibitor reported was glyburide, an FDA-approved antidiabetic drug of the sulfonylurea class, which was found to inhibit the release of IL-1β induced by stimuli in human monocytes and murine macrophages. Subsequently, MCC950 (also known as CRID3), a direct NLRP3 inhibitor, was discovered. While showing promising results in preclinical and clinical trials for treating diseases, higher doses of MCC950 led to elevated transaminase levels and hepatotoxicity concerns. Recent studies using MCC950 as a research tool have prompted the development of safer and more effective NLRP3 inhibitors, including a series of compounds currently undergoing clinical trials, highlighting the potential of NLRP3 inhibitors in attenuating disease progression and improving therapeutic outcomes. In this chapter, we delve into the latest progress in understanding the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its roles in the pathophysiology of neurological diseases. We also summarize recent development of small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors along with the associated obstacles and concerns.",2024-11-08
39911136,Relocating NSAIDs into the endoplasmic reticulum induces ER stress-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells.,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a vital subcellular organelle that orchestrates numerous essential biological processes, including protein synthesis and processing. Disruption of ER function can lead to ER stress, a condition closely associated with the progression and development of cancer. Consequently, inducing ER stress in cancer cells has emerged as an unconventional yet promising therapeutic approach. However, selectively targeting the ER within cancer cells remains a significant challenge. To address this, we have designed and synthesized a novel small-molecule library composed of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), fluorescent probes, and ER-targeting moieties. Through screening the library in cancer cells, we identified a promising compound: an ibuprofen derivative conjugated with a dansyl group as a dual fluorescence tag and ER-targeting moiety. This ibuprofen derivative successfully localized into the ER of HCT-116 colon cancer cells within 3 h, induced ER stress by upregulating key stress markers such as CHOP, GRP94, IRE-1α, PERK, and Cas-12, while simultaneously inhibiting Cox-2. The resulting ER stress triggered autophagy by upregulating Beclin and LC3-II/LC3-I as autophagy markers, followed by apoptosis, culminating in significant cancer cell death, particularly when combined with bafilomycin A, 10-hydroxycamptothecin and obatoclax. This NSAID-based ER stress inducer provides a powerful tool for exploring the chemical biology of NSAIDs in the ER and holds great potential for advancing ER-targeted cancer therapies in combination with other anti-cancer drugs.",2025-01-23
39909173,Efficacy of a novel PCSK9 inhibitory peptide alone and with evinacumab in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.,"Atherosclerosis is the major cause of cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the effect of lipid lowering using a novel peptide inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and a monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like 3 (evinacumab), either alone or in combination in APOE∗3-Leiden.CETP mice fed a Western diet. Effects on body weight, plasma lipids, atherosclerotic lesion size, severity, composition, and morphology were assessed. Treatment with PCSK9 inhibitory peptide significantly decreased both cholesterol and triglycerides (-69% and -68%, respectively). Similar reductions were seen in evinacumab-treated mice (-44% and -55%, respectively). The combination of evinacumab and PCSK9 inhibitory peptide lowered these levels to a larger extent than evinacumab alone (cholesterol: -74%; triglycerides: -81%). Reductions occurred in non-HDL-C without changes in HDL-C. Atherosclerotic lesion size was significantly reduced in all treatment groups compared to vehicle controls (evinacumab: -72%; PCSK9 inhibitory peptide: -97%; combination: -98%). Similarly, all interventions improved atherosclerotic lesion severity, with more undiseased segments and fewer severe lesions. Evaluation of the composition of severe atherosclerotic plaques revealed significant improvement in lesion stability in mice treated with both evinacumab and PCSK9 inhibitory peptide, attributable to decreased macrophage content and increased collagen content. Additionally, evaluation of lipid concentrations in cynomolgus monkeys revealed the beneficial effects of the PCSK9 inhibitory peptide on total cholesterol and LDL-C levels. Treatment with a novel PCSK9 inhibitory peptide alone or with evinacumab shows great potential to reduce and stabilize atherosclerotic lesions.",2025-02-03
39904145,Computer-aided discovery of novel AMPK activators through virtual screening and SAR-driven synthesis.,"AMPK is a promising target for various chronic illnesses such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to develop a novel small molecule that directly activates AMPK, with the potential to fundamentally modulate the pathogenic mechanisms of the metabolic disorders. To identify a potent novel pharmacophore in an unbiased way, we performed structure-based virtual screening on a commercially available chemical library, and evaluated the actual AMPK activity of 118 compounds selected from 100,000 compounds based on docking scores. Additional iterative molecular docking studies and experimental evaluation of AMPK activity led us to select a hit compound, B1, with a chromone backbone. Using the hit compound and other compounds structurally similar to the hit compound, we identified the chalcone structure as a new scaffold with more efficient interactions with key residues required for AMPK activation. From the newly designed and synthesized chalcone derivatives, we discovered compound 6 as a candidate compound. Compound 6 showed the most efficient interactions with the key residues of AMPK at in silico study and demonstrated significant activation of AMPK in both in vitro and in cellular assays.",2025-01-27

A ClusPro 2.0 server was used to analyze the interaction between FGL1 and LAG3, and the candidate peptides were identified by using the Rosetta peptide derivate protocol. Three candidate peptides targeting FGL1, named FGLP21, FGLP22, and FGLP23, with a simulated affinity of -9.56, -8.55, and -8.71 kcal/mol, respectively, were identified. The peptides were readily conjugated with p-NCS-benzyl-NODA-GA, and the resulting compounds were successfully labeled with <sup>68</sup>Ga in approximately 70% yields and radiochemical purity greater than 95%. In vitro competitive cell-binding assay demonstrated that all probes bound to FGL1 with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 100 nM to 160 nM. Among the probes, PET imaging revealed that <sup>68</sup>Ga-NODA-FGLP21 exhibited the best tumor imaging performance in mice bearing FGL1 positive Huh7 tumor. At 60 min p.i., the tumor uptake of <sup>68</sup>Ga-NODA-FGLP21 was significantly higher than those of <sup>68</sup>Ga-NODA-FGLP22 and <sup>68</sup>Ga-NODA-FGLP23, respectively (2.51 ± 0.11% ID/g vs 1.00 ± 0.16% ID/g and 1.49 ± 0.05% ID/g). Simultaneously, the tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios of the former were also higher than those of the latter, respectively (19.40 ± 2.30 vs 9.65 ± 0.62 and 12.45 ± 0.72). In the presence of unlabeled FGLP21, the uptake of <sup>68</sup>Ga-NODA-FGLP21 in Huh7 xenograft decreased to 0.81 ± 0.09% ID/g at 60 min p.i., which is similar to that observed in the FGL1 negative U87 MG tumor (0.46 ± 0.03% ID/g). The results were consistent with the immunohistochemical analysis and ex vivo autoradiography. No significant radioactivity was accumulated in normal organs, except for kidneys. In summary, a preclinical study confirmed that the tracer <sup>68</sup>Ga-NODA-FGLP21 has the potential to specifically detect FGL1 expression in tumors with good contrast to the background.",2025-02-02
39892673,Design of indomethacin novel small molecule hydrogels for concomitant release and permeability increases.,"With the expansion of gel research, organic small molecule gels are beginning to gain attention. Whether the small-molecule gel approach can be a new formulation strategy of solubilization and permeation promotion for poorly soluble drugs needs to be explored in this study. The model ingredient indomethacin (IND) as a nonsteroidal anti-flammatory drug shows limited therapeutic application mainly due to its low water solubility. Herein, the IND small molecule hydrogel was design to co-formed with a small molecule ligand by integrating theory-model-experiment techniques. Then, the formed IND small molecule hydrogels (i.e., IND-MEG hydrogel and IND-ARG hydrogel) with meglumine (MEG) or arginine (ARG) appeared typical 3-D network with good rheology. In comparison to crystalline IND, the solubilities of IND-MEG hydrogel and IND-ARG hydrogel exhibited 506.71-fold and 479.63-fold improvements, respectively. Meanwhile, both IND hydrogels performed significantly enhanced release rate and degree, and maintained supersaturation for a long time arising from the complexation reaction of IND and ligand, which was revealed by phase solubility and fluorescence quenching studies. Furthermore, the designed IND hydrogels significantly promoted IND membrane permeability compared to the commercial IND hydrogel, and enhanced the development potential of novel IND hydrogels for oral and transdermal applications. Therefore, this study provides a new formulation technique to increase the solubility/release and permeability of poorly water-soluble drugs by designing their small molecule hydrogel systems.",2025-01-30
39892093,Rational design of dual-agonist peptides targeting GLP-1 and NPY2 receptors for regulating glucose homeostasis and body weight with minimal nausea and emesis.,"There is an urgent need for effective treatments targeting comorbidities of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity. Developing dual agonists of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) and neuropeptide Y receptor type 2 (NPY2R) with combined PYY<sub>3-36</sub> and GLP-1 bioactivity is promising. However, designing such dual agonists that effectively control glycemia and reduce weight while minimizing gastrointestinal side effects is challenging. In this study, we systematically evaluated the side effects induced by co-administering various GLP-1R agonists and PYY<sub>3-36</sub> analogue. Our findings revealed that different GLP-1R agonist-PYY analogue combinations elicited gastrointestinal side effects of varying intensities. Among these, the co-administration of bullfrog GLP-1 analogue (bGLP-1) with PYY<sub>3-36</sub> analogue resulted in lower gastrointestinal side effects. Thus, bGLP-1 was selected as the preferred candidate for designing dual GLP-1R/NPY2R agonists. Through stepwise structural design, optimization of linker arms, and durability enhancements, coupled with in vitro receptor screening, the novel peptide bGLP/PYY-19 emerged as the lead candidate. Notably, experimental results in mice and rats showed a significant reduction in emesis with bGLP/PYY-19 compared to semaglutide and bGLP-1 long-acting analogue (LAbGLP-1). Furthermore, bGLP/PYY-19 significantly outperformed semaglutide and LAbGLP-1 in reducing body weight in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, without inducing nausea-associated behavior. These findings underscore the potential of dual-targeting single peptide conjugates as a promising strategy for developing glucoregulatory treatments that offer superior weight loss benefits and are better tolerated compared to treatments targeting GLP-1R alone.",2025-01-24

39858425,"Senegalin-2: A Novel Hexadecapeptide from <i>Kassina senegalensis</i> with Antibacterial and Muscle Relaxant Activities, and Its Derivative Senegalin-2BK as a Bradykinin Antagonist.","The amphibian skin secretions are excellent sources of bioactive peptides, some of which and their derivatives exhibit multiple properties, including antibacterial and antagonism against bradykinin. A novel peptide Senegalin-2 was isolated from the skin secretions of <i>Kassina senegalensis</i> frog. Senegalin-2 relaxed rat bladder smooth muscle (EC<sub>50</sub> 17.94 nM) and ileum smooth muscle (EC<sub>50</sub> 135 nM), inhibited <i>S. aureus</i> and MRSA at 2 μM, and exhibited low hemolytic activity with no cytotoxicity. To design effective bradykinin antagonists, Senegalin-2 was conjugated with bradykinin to synthesize Senegalin-2BK. This modification retained potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Compared to Senegalin-2, Senegalin-2BK significantly reduced hemolysis and exhibited a more than threefold increase in the selectivity index. Furthermore, Senegalin-2BK contracted the bladder (EC<sub>50</sub> 2.83 μM) and ileum (EC<sub>50</sub> 56.64 nM)'s smooth muscle. The pretreatment with 10<sup>-7</sup> M Senegalin-2BK reduced the 10<sup>-6</sup> M bradykinin contraction on the bladder by over 70%. In conclusion, Senegalin-2 has dual functionalities as an antibacterial agent and muscle relaxant, positioning it as a potential therapeutic candidate for managing overactive bladder. As a synthetically derived bradykinin antagonist and myotropic peptide with antibacterial properties, Senegalin-2BK shows promise in effective therapies for relieving pain, inflammation, and addressing muscular disorders such as urinary retention, constipation, and infections.",2024-12-30
39851984,In Vitro Investigation of Novel Peptide Hydrogels for Enamel Remineralization.,"This study investigates the microstructure of dental enamel following demineralization and re-mineralization processes, using DIAGNOdent scores and images obtained via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and microhardness (Vickers). The research evaluates the effects of two experimental hydrogels, Anti-Amelogenin isoform X (ABT260, S1) and Anti-Kallikrein L1 (K3014, S2), applied to demineralized enamel surfaces over periods of 14 and 21 days. The study involved 60 extracted teeth, free from cavities or other lesions, divided into four groups: a positive group (+), a negative group (-) and groups S1 and S2. The last three groups underwent demineralization with 37% phosphoric acid for 20 min. The negative group (-) was without remineralization treatment. The DIAGNOdent scores indicate that the S1 group treated with Anti-Amelogenin is more effective in remineralizing the enamel surface compared to the S2 group treated with Anti-Kallikrein. These findings were corroborated by SEM and AFM images, which revealed elongated hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticles integrated into the demineralized structures. Demineralization reduced enamel microhardness to about 1/3 of a healthy one. Both tested hydrogels restored enamel hardness, with S1 being more effective than S2. Both peptides facilitated the interaction between the newly added minerals and residual protein binders on the enamel surface, thereby contributing to effective enamel restoration.",2024-12-27
39851528,Targeted Inhibition of GATA-3 by Pyrrothiogatain: Implications for Adipocyte Biology and Inflammatory Response.,"GATA-3 is a master regulator of preadipocyte differentiation and function. Pharmacological or genetic targeting of GATA-3 will allow us to understand the function of GATA-3 in regulating metabolism, insulin signaling, and inflammation. Pyrrothiogatain, a novel small molecule inhibitor of GATA family proteins, has emerged as a promising tool for modulating GATA-3 activity. This study aims to investigate the specificity of Pyrrothiogatain in regulating GATA-3-mediated preadipocyte differentiation and adipokine secretion under normal and pathological conditions. Wild-type and GATA-3 knockout 3T3-L1 cells were treated with different concentrations of Pyrrothiogatain in the presence and absence of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), an inducer of oxidative stress and impairment of adipogenesis. As expected, GATA-3 knockout cells exhibited enhanced adipogenic capacity, characterized by increased cell and lipid droplet sizes, and upregulated expression of key adipogenic markers including CEBPβ, PPARγ, and PGC-1α. Pyrrothiogatain treatment reduced cell proliferation in both wild-type and GATA-3 knockout 3T3-L1 cells, but did not alter their adipogenic capacity. Furthermore, Pyrrothiogatain lowered secreted IL-6 levels and attenuated 4-HNE-induced TNF-α elevation in wild-type, but not in GATA-3 knockout cells. Co-treatment of 4-HNE and Pyrrothiogatain led to increased cell size, suggesting complex interactions between oxidative stress and GATA protein inhibition. This effect was similar to GATA-3 knockout cells, indicating Pyrrothiogatain's potential to modulate cellular stress responses independently of GATA-3 inhibition. These results reveal that Pyrrothiogatain's effects on adipocyte biology extend beyond simple GATA-3 inhibition. While GATA-3 knockout primarily affects adipogenesis, Pyrrothiogatain modulates inflammatory responses and potentially cellular stress mechanisms without directly impacting adipocyte differentiation. This study provides new insights into the multifaceted actions of Pyrrothiogatain and highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent for lowering inflammation and oxidative-stress-related aspects of metabolic disorders, distinct from the direct modulation of adipogenesis.",2025-01-10
39850566,Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) can potentially be used as therapeutic drugs to reduce hypertension caused by small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).,"The emergence of targeted anti-tumor drugs has significantly prolonged the lifespan and improved the prognosis of cancer patients. Among these drugs, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, particularly novel small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), are extensively employed as VEGF inhibitors; however, they are also associated with a higher incidence of complications, with hypertension being the most prevalent cardiovascular toxic side effect. Currently, it is widely accepted that TKIs-induced hypertension involves multiple mechanisms including dysregulation of the endothelin (ET) axis, reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), imbalance in NO-ROS equilibrium system, vascular rarefaction, and activation of epithelial sodium calcium channels; nevertheless, excessive activation of ET system appears to be predominantly responsible for this condition. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that ET plays a pivotal role in driving TKIs-induced hypertension. Therefore, this review aims to explore the significance of ET in the pathogenesis of hypertension induced by targeted anti-tumor drugs and investigate the potential therapeutic value of endothelin antagonists in managing hypertension caused by targeted anti-tumor drugs.",2025-01-09

39817951,Peptide-based PET/CT imaging visualizes PD-L1-driven radioresistance in glioblastoma.,"Radioresistance remains a great challenge for radiotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). PD-L1 expression is a key contributor to radioresistance and immune escape in GBM. The lack of effective methods to monitor the change of PD-L1 during radiotherapy in patients limits timely intervention and management of the resistance. Here, we developed a novel peptide tracer [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 for PET/CT to visualize the changes of PD-L1 expression in response to radiotherapy, revealing PD-L1-driven radioresistance in GBM.

39766503,PA-Win2: In Silico-Based Discovery of a Novel Peptide with Dual Antibacterial and Anti-Biofilm Activity.,"<b>Background:</b> The emergence and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs) have become a serious global threat, as the morbidity and mortality associated with ARB infections are continuously rising. The activation of quorum sensing (QS) genes can promote biofilm formation, which contributes to the acquisition of drug resistance and increases virulence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new antimicrobial agents to control ARB and prevent further development. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally occurring defense molecules in organisms known to suppress pathogens through a broad range of antimicrobial mechanisms. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we utilized a previously developed deep-learning model to identify AMP candidates from the venom gland transcriptome of the spider <i>Pardosa astrigera</i>, followed by experimental validation. <b>Results:</b> PA-Win2 was among the top-scoring predicted peptides and was selected based on physiochemical features. Subsequent experimental validation demonstrated that PA-Win2 inhibits the growth of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and multidrug-resistant <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> (MRPA) strain CCARM 2095. The peptide exhibited strong bactericidal activity against <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>, and MRPA CCARM 2095 through the depolarization of bacterial cytoplasmic membranes and alteration of gene expression associated with bacterial survival. In addition, PA-Win2 effectively inhibited biofilm formation and degraded pre-formed biofilms of <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>. The gene expression study showed that the peptide treatment led to the downregulation of QS genes in the Las, Pqs, and Rhl systems. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings suggest PA-Win2 as a promising drug candidate against ARB and demonstrate the potential of in silico methods in discovering functional peptides from biological data.",2024-11-21

Additionally, it proposes individualized treatment strategies tailored to different driver gene types, aiming to provide clinicians with a reference to enhance the overall diagnostic and therapeutic standards for NSCLC brain metastases in China. .",2025-01-07
39759328,Design and in silico analysis of a novel peptide-based multiepitope vaccine against glioblastoma multiforme by targeting tumor-associated macrophage.,"CD204 is a distinct indicator for tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in glioma. Evidence indicates that CD204-positive TAMs are involved in the aggressive behavior of various types of cancers. This study was conducted to develop a new and effective peptide-based vaccine for GBM, specifically targeting CD204. Epitopes of the target protein were identified using NetMHCpan 4.1a, NetMHCIIpan-4.0, and ABCpred tools. Subsequently, the predicted epitopes were evaluated using bioinformatics tools to assess their antigenicity, non-allergenicity, immunogenicity, non-toxicity, and potential to stimulate the production of IL-4 and IFN-γ in HTL epitopes. Selected T-cell epitopes demonstrated a robust binding affinity with the particular HLA alleles. Finally, four HTL epitopes, three CTL epitopes, and two B-cell epitopes, jointed via linkers and adjuvant, were used for the final vaccine construct design. Analysis disclosed that the developed vaccine demonstrated robust antigenic properties while proving soluble, stable, non-toxic, and non-allergenic. Additionally, molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed a robust correlation between the designed vaccine and TLR-2 and TLR-4 immune receptors. The molecular docking results demonstrated a strong interaction between the newly developed vaccine and TLR2 (-895.1 kcal/mol) and TLR4 (-881.0 kcal/mol) receptors. During the simulation, the vaccine-TLR2 and vaccine-TLR4 complexes exhibited binding energies of -113.41 and -106.61 kcal/mol, respectively. Analysis by different bioinformatic tools indicated the potential of the designed vaccine in immune stimulation and a significant elevation in IgG and IgM antibodies, T-helper cells, T-cytotoxic cells, INF-γ, IL-2, and IL-4. Research findings show that the newly designed multi-epitope vaccine is promising in providing long-term immunity against GBM and offers a promising therapeutic alternative.",2024-11-28

In this work, we selected high affinity peptides against the protein of human DNA binding domain of FOXM1 (FOXM1-DBD) from the disulfide-constrained, phage displayed random cyclic heptapeptide library Ph.D.-C7C. We obtained a novel peptide, 9 R-CP29L, which was identified to be a potent anticancer peptide with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 9.0 and 11.1 μM at 24 h for HCCLM3 and MD-MBA-231 cells respectively. Molecular docking, CETSA, ITC and immunoblot assays demonstrated that 9 R-CP29L can potentially specifically bind to FOXM1-DBD with a K<sub>d</sub> value of 1.25 μM and reduced the expression of FOXM1. In addition, Annexin V/PI flow cytometry, AO/EB staining, PI flow cytometry, clone formation and Transwell assays revealed that 9 R-CP29L also induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest while inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCCLM3 cells. The findings were further supported by the results of qRT-PCR and immunoblot assays for the associated gene (CMYC, CDC25B, BAX, CASPASE3 and MMP2, etc) expression in HCCLM3 cells. Finally, in vivo experiment showed that 9 R-CP29 significantly reduced the tumor growth and downregulated the expression of FOXM1 in HCCLM3 xenograft nude mouse models.

39740705,Investigation on the effects and mechanisms of novel peptide nanofiber gel to promote wound healing of deep second-degree burns in mice.,"The self-assembled peptide RADA16-I (RADARADARADARADA) has been widely used in biomaterials. However, studies on the practical application of self-assembled peptide hydrogels loaded with bioactive peptides are still insufficient. In this study, we successfully prepared the peptide nanofiber gel RGJ by incorporating the bioactive peptides A8SGLP-1 (G) and Jagged-1 (J) into RADA16-I (R) in specific ratios. The mechanical properties, secondary structure, and microstructure of RGJ were thoroughly characterized using a rheometer, circular dichroism (CD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that R and RGJ adopted stable β-folded structures at room temperature, and RGJ exhibited a nanofiber mesh structure, confirming its excellent physical properties. Cellular experiments demonstrated that RGJ significantly enhanced the proliferation and migration of HaCaT, L929, and HUVEC cells, with the most pronounced effect observed in HUVEC cells. In the 100 μg/mL RGJ-treated group, cell viability (OD value) reached 1.369, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (0.673) and the R-only group (0.848). The strongest pro-migratory effect was observed in HaCaT cells, with a scratch closure rate of 22.83 %. In vivo experiments showed that the deep second-degree burn wounds of mice in the RGJ gel-treated group healed rapidly by day 17, exhibiting 99.5 % wound closure, compared to 84.02 % in the R gel group, and 73.02 % and 70.97 % in the control and burn cream groups, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and ELISA results further confirmed that RGJ significantly reduced wound and systemic inflammatory responses while promoting the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and CD31, revealing its potential mechanism for enhancing burn wound healing. Additionally, RGJ significantly reduced wound scar formation and increased skin collagen deposition, demonstrating a favorable biosafety profile compared to the control group, commercial burn ointment, and the R-only treatment group.

39737550,nsP2 Protease Inhibitor Blocks the Replication of New World Alphaviruses and Offer Protection in Mice.,"New World alphaviruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), and western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), are mosquito-transmitted viruses that cause disease in humans. These viruses are endemic to the western hemisphere, and disease in humans may lead to encephalitis and long-term neurological sequelae. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by these viruses. The alphavirus nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) functions as a protease, which is critical for the establishment of a productive viral infection by enabling accurate processing of the nsP123 polyprotein. Owing to the essential role played by nsP2 in the alphavirus infectious process, it is also a valuable therapeutic target. In this article, we report the synthesis and evaluation of novel small molecule inhibitors that target the alphavirus nsP2 protease via a covalent mode of action. The two lead compounds demonstrated robust inhibition of viral replication <i>in vitro</i>. These inhibitors interfered with the processing of the nsP123 polyprotein as determined using VEEV TC-83 as a model pathogen and are active against EEEV and WEEV. The compounds were found to be nontoxic in two different mouse strains and demonstrated antiviral activity in a VEEV TC-83 lethal challenge mouse model. Cumulatively, the outcomes of this study provide a compelling rationale for the preclinical development of nsP2 protease inhibitors as direct-acting antiviral therapeutics against alphaviruses.",2024-12-31
39736335,Analysis of mechanisms of the rabies virus P protein-nucleocapsid interaction using engineered N-protein peptides and potential applications in antivirals design.,"The Phosphoprotein (P protein) of the rabies virus has multiple roles in virus replication. A critical function is to act as a cofactor in genome replication and mRNA production through binding via its N-terminal region to the L protein, the essential enzyme for mRNA and genome synthesis/processing, and via its C-terminal domain (P<sub>CTD</sub>) to the N protein and viral RNA (N-RNA) ribonucleoprotein complex. The binding site of the P<sub>CTD</sub> on the N protein is a disordered loop that is expected to be phosphorylated at Ser389. This interface may provide novel targets for antiviral approaches. Following an alanine scan of the peptide we selected two single site mutations that showed improved affinity and combined these mutations with a phosphomimetic (S389E) to produce double and triple mutants in the context of linear and cyclic peptides of the disordered loop, with the goal of generating a competitive peptide against the N-RNA complex. To assess the binding properties of the peptides we characterized their thermodynamics identifying complex properties of improved enthalpy but with compensating entropy for mutants and cyclized peptides. Nevertheless, a triple mutant shows 3.5-fold stronger affinity for P<sub>CTD</sub> than the full-length S389E N protein. Structural characterization of the triple mutant suggests the improved affinity may be due to trapping a favoured β-strand structure for binding to the P<sub>CTD</sub>. This novel peptide may serve as a template for the future design of antivirals.",2024-12-28

As a crucial transcriptional factor that regulates cellular response to oxidative stress, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an attractive therapeutic target for DKD. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of DDO-1039, a novel small-molecule Nrf2 activator developed with protein-protein interaction strategy, on podocyte injury in DKD. <b><i>Results:</i></b> DDO-1039 treatment significantly increased Nrf2 protein level and Nrf2 nuclear translocation, thereby upregulating Nrf2 target genes [heme oxygenase 1, NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier, and tyrosine-protein kinase receptor] both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. DDO-1039 attenuated glomerular sclerosis and podocyte injury in the high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced (HFD/STZ) diabetic mice and db/db diabetic mice. It also significantly improved hyperglycemia in both diabetic mice and mitigated proteinuria in HFD/STZ mice.

39719161,Emerging medications and pharmacological treatment approaches for substance use disorders.,"Medications to treat substance use disorders (SUDs) remain suboptimal or, in the case of stimulants and cannabis, non-existent. Many factors have contributed to this paucity, including the biological complexity of addiction, regulatory challenges, and a historical lack of enthusiasm among pharmaceutical companies to commit resources to this disease space. Despite these headwinds, the recent opioid crisis has highlighted the devastating consequences of SUDs for both individuals and society, stimulating urgent efforts to identify novel treatment approaches. In addition, several neurobiological systems have been recently implicated in unique aspects of drug reward, opening the door to candidate medications with novel mechanisms of action. Here, we provide an overview of efforts to target several of these new systems, with a focus on those that are the subject of ongoing clinical trials as well as being areas of interest among the authors' research groups (MHJ, MTB, NAE). Specifically, we discuss new classes of medications targeting the serotonin 2A receptor (i.e., psychedelics), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor, cannabidiol, dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor, orexin/hypocretin, and oxytocin receptor systems, as well as emergent approaches for modulating the more canonical dopaminergic system via agonist therapies for stimulant use disorders.

39716238,A novel self-assembling peptide nanofiber hydrogel with glucagon-like peptide-1 functionality enhances islet survival to improve islet transplantation outcome in diabetes treatment.,"Islet transplantation is a promising therapy for diabetes, yet the limited survival and functionality of transplanted islet grafts hinder optimal outcomes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an endogenous hormone, has shown potential to enhance islet survival and function; however, its systemic administration can result in poor localization and undesirable side effects. To address these challenges, we developed a novel peptide-based nanofiber hydrogel incorporating GLP-1 functionality for localized delivery. By conjugating the FFG tripeptide (a self-assembling motif derived from phenylalanine-phenylalanine-glycine) to the C-terminus of native GLP-1, we engineered GLP-1-FFG, a self-assembling peptide that forms a robust nanofiber structure resistant to enzymatic degradation. When GLP-1-FFG co-assembles with the biotin-<sup>D</sup>FYIGSRGD peptide (referred to as SupraGel), a self-assembling supramolecular polypeptide hydrogel we previously identified containing motifs derived from extracellular matrix components, the resulting hydrogel (SupraGel + GLP-1-FFG) creates a stable nanofibrous network with excellent rheological properties. In vitro, this nanofiber hydrogel significantly improves islet function and survival. Bulk RNA sequencing results demonstrate that the hydrogel suppresses the expression of hypoxia-related genes, downregulates pro-inflammatory genes, and upregulates genes associated with islet function. Further analysis reveals that these effects are related to the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. In a syngeneic mouse islet transplantation model, the localized application of SupraGel + GLP-1-FFG at the renal subcapsular islet transplant site significantly enhanced the efficacy of marginal-dose islet transplantation, as shown by improved glycemic control, faster and higher rates of diabetes reversal, better glucose tolerance, and greater islet graft survival in diabetic recipient mice. This innovative nanotechnology-based hydrogel offers a promising strategy for enhancing the efficacy of islet grafts in transplantation therapy.",2024-12-23

39700715,A mitochondrial targeted fluorescent probe for imaging nitroreductase activity and photodynamic therapy in tumor cells.,"The hypoxic environment in tumors is closely linked to tumor structure, function, dissemination, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Nitroreductase (NTR) is often recognized as a biomarker to evaluate the hypoxia degree for tumor cells. Traditional detection methods such as PET, MRI and multispectral photoacoustic tomography have limitations. Fluorescent probes have garnered attention due to their high sensitivity, rapid response, specificity, and non-invasive nature. In this study, we introduced a novel small molecule fluorescent probe, T-TPE-NO<sub>2</sub>, designed with an AIE molecular framework TPE and successfully targeted to the mitochondria of tumor cells. The probe had high selectivity and could detect NTR activity in a broad pH range. Additionally, the probe exhibits high sensitivity with a LOD of 46.3 ng/mL. Under tumor NTR, the probe emitted strong fluorescence signals and generated a substantial amount of reactive oxygen species upon laser irradiation, thereby inducing tumor cell death and enabling photodynamic therapy. The synthesis, structural and morphological characterization of the probe were rigorously validated. Experimental results demonstrate that T-TPE-NO<sub>2</sub> exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity for tumor cells, highlighting its potential application in photodynamic therapy.

Although direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have a reduced incidence of major bleeding compared with warfarin, they still carry a bleeding risk, resulting in a suboptimal therapeutic index. Epidemiologic data suggest that inhibiting activated factor XI (FXIa) may offer an improved safety profile with respect to bleeding risk compared with current-generation DOACs. Additionally, a phase II trial of milvexian in patients undergoing elective total knee replacement demonstrated robust dose-dependent efficacy with no statistically significant increase in bleeding. Nevertheless, the ability to rapidly and effectively correct FXIa inhibitor-induced anticoagulation may still be important in situations where patients experience uncontrolled bleeding or require emergency surgery.",2024-10-23
39679370,Discovery of novel PARP1/NRP1 dual-targeting inhibitors with strong antitumor potency.,"Given that overexpression of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) and Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is implicated in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer, the design of dual PARP1/NRP1 inhibitors has wide therapeutic prospect. However, there have been no reports of such inhibitors so far. Herein, we discovered novel small molecule inhibitors that simultaneously target PARP1 and NRP1 using structure-based virtual screening for the treatment of breast cancer. Notably, PPNR-4 was the most potent inhibitor targeting PARP1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.71 ± 0.39 nM) and NRP1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 24.48 ± 2.16 nM). PPNR-4 showed high affinity and binding stability to PARP1 and NRP1. The cytotoxicity assays showed that PPNR-4 demonstrated significant antiproliferative activity on MDA-MB-231 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.21 μM) without effect on normal human cells. <i>In vivo</i> experiments exhibited that PPNR-4 showed more effective than the positive controls in inhibiting the growth of tumors.

39676964,A High-Throughput Method for Screening Peptide Activators of G-Protein-Coupled Receptors.,"Here, we describe an innovative and efficient method for screening peptide activators of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) utilizing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) approach. We designed a library of 92,918 peptides fused with transmembrane domains of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). We employed a pooled lentiviral system to promote the expression of these proteins at the cellular membrane and evaluate their ability to activate GPCRs. We then used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to screen the GPI-AP-peptide library and identify novel peptide activators of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). We discovered one peptide PepA3 derived from the Frizzled-like (FZ) domain of human Carboxypeptidase Z (CPZ), a regulated secreted metallocarboxypeptidase. Notably, PepA3 and its two related variants, PepA and PepA2, activated the GLP-1R receptor with less potency but comparable efficacy to that of GLP-1. We then hypothesized that all of these peptides will bind differently to the GLP-1R than the normal ligand. Our technology could identify novel GPCR-activating peptides for structure-function or drug discovery research.",2024-11-22

39665218,FVIII peptides presented on HLA-DP and identification of an A3 domain peptide binding with high affinity to the commonly expressed HLA-DP4.,"The development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) poses a major challenge in hemophilia A (HA) treatment. The formation of FVIII inhibitors is a CD4+ T-cell dependent mechanism which includes antigen presenting cells (APCs), B- and T-helper lymphocytes. APCs present FVIII derived peptides on major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) to CD4+ Tcells. We previously established a mass spectrometry based approach to delineate the FVIII repertoire presented on HLA-DR and HLA-DQ. In this study, specific attention was directed towards the identification of FVIII peptides presented on HLA-DP. A data-set of naturally processed FVIII peptides was generated by incubating human FVIII with immature monocytes-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) from HLA-typed healthy donors. Using this method, we identified 176 to 1352 different HLA-DP presented peptides per donor, including 26 different FVIII derived peptides. The most frequently presented peptides derived from the A3, and C2 domains of FVIII. Comparison of the FVIII repertoire presented on HLA-DP with that presented on HLA-DR revealed considerable overlap but also suggested preferential presentation of specific peptides on either HLA-DR or HLA-DP. Fourteen FVIII peptides presented on HLA-DP were synthesized and evaluated for their binding ability to the commonly expressed HLA-DP4 molecule which is highly prevalent in the Caucasian population. Peptide binding studies showed that 7 of 14 peptides competed with a reference peptide to HLADP4. Interestingly, an A3 domain derived peptide bound with high affinity to HLA-DP4 positioning this peptide as a prime candidate for the development of novel peptide-based tolerogenic strategies for FVIII inhibitors.",2024-12-12

Dysregulation of this pathway contributes to diseases such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy. Existing VEGFA inhibitors are effective but have limitations, driving interest in peptide-based therapeutics. Peptide inhibitors offer advantages, including reduced toxicity, improved formulation flexibility, and enhanced stability. This study leverages computational tools, particularly ProteinMPNN and Rosetta, to design optimized peptide-based VEGFA inhibitors. Building on the existing peptide templates mini-Z-1 and Z-1-2, new sequences were computationally predicted and experimentally validated. A novel peptide with improved affinity (KD = 6.2 µM) compared to mini-Z-1 (KD = 9.3 µM) was found, requiring only one round of design and testing. The integration of ProteinMPNN and Rosetta enabled a rapid and cost-effective pipeline for designing potent VEGFA inhibitors, underscoring the potential of computational peptide design in developing next-generation therapeutics targeting angiogenesis-dependent diseases.",2024-11-30
39643141,Pleiotropic anti-cancer activities of novel non-covalent thioredoxin reductase inhibitors against triple negative breast cancer.,"Mounting evidence shows that tumor growth and progression rely on thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1)-mediated detoxification of oxidative stress that results from deregulated metabolism and mitogenic signaling in tumors. TXNRD1 levels are significant higher in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared to normal tissue, making TXNRD1 a compelling TNBC therapeutic target. Despite the many attempts to generate TXNRD1 inhibitors, all known and reported compounds inhibiting TXNRD1 are problematic; they interact with TXNRD1 irreversibly and non-specifically resulting in numerous adverse side effects. Recently, a series of breakthrough studies identified a novel regulatory site, the 'doorstop pocket', in Schistosoma mansoni thioredoxin glutathione reductase, a TXNRD-like enzyme and an established drug target for the human parasitic infection, schistosomiasis. This discovery underpins the development of new first-in-class non-covalent inhibitors for this family of enzymes. Our data show that novel non-covalent TXNRD inhibitors (TXNRD(i)s) are potent dose-dependent inhibitors of viability in cellular models of TNBC. TXNRD(i)s attenuate several aggressive cancer phenotypes such as, clonogenic survival, mammosphere forming efficiency, invasion, and TXNRD-related gene expression in TNBC cells. TXNRD(i)s engage and inhibit TXNRD1 in live TNBC cells and xenograft tumors, thus supporting the mechanism of action at a cellular level. More importantly, TXNRD(i)s attenuated tumor growth in a preclinical MDA-MB-231 TNBC xenograft mouse model. Although additional optimization for TXNRD(i)s' potency is warranted, these results may open a new avenue for the development of novel small molecule therapeutics for TNBC.",2024-12-04
39642207,Hapalindole Q suppresses autophagosome-lysosome fusion by promoting YAP1 degradation via chaperon-mediated autophagy.,"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for many diseases. Mechanistically novel small-molecule autophagy regulators are highly desirable from a pharmacological point of view. Here, we report the macroautophagy-inhibitory effect of hapalindole Q, a member of the structurally intriguing but biologically understudied hapalindole family of indole terpenoids. This compound promotes the noncanonical degradation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), the downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, via chaperone-mediated autophagy, disrupting proper distribution of Rab7 and suppressing autophagosome-lysosome fusion in macroautophagy. Its binding to YAP1 is further confirmed by using biophysical techniques. A preliminary structure-activity relationship study reveals that the hapalindole Q scaffold, rather than the isothiocyanate group, is essential for YAP1 binding and degradation. This work not only identifies a macroautophagy inhibitor with a distinct mechanism of action but also provided a molecular scaffold for direct targeting of YAP1, which may benefit the development of therapeutics for both autophagy-related and Hippo-YAP-related diseases.",2024-12-06
39625835,Determination of QLNC-3A6 in canine plasma by UHPLC-MS/MS and its application in pharmacokinetic studies.,"Multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor QLNC-3A6 Di-maleate, a structurally novel small molecule compound, has therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (CMCT) caused by mutations in the c-Kit gene. Since pharmacokinetic (PK) information plays an important role in the development and application of new drugs, etc., a rapid, highly sensitive and selective UHPLC-MS/MS analytical method was developed and validated for the first time in this study for the quantitative detection of QLNC-3A6 in canine plasma. 100 µL of plasma was precipitated using 350 µL of acetonitrile, and Chromatographic separation was performed on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, the mobile phases were set to 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (A) and 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile (B). The calibration curve linear range was 0.5-100 ng/mL (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>>0.99). The intraday and interday precision values (relative standard deviation, RSD) were 2.06-13.57% and 6.90-9.14%. Intraday and interday accuracies were -10.73 to 9.54% and -3.86 to 0.70% respectively. The dilution integrity RSD value and stability RSD value were less than 3.77 and 7.45%, respectively. Subsequently, the pharmacokinetics were investigated in canine after oral administration of QLNC-3A6 Di-maleate tablets at a dose of 3 mg/kg BW using this method. The results showed that QLNC-3A6 showed fast absorption rate, rapid distribution and slow metabolic elimination in canine plasma. The results of the main PK parameters including <i>λ</i>z, <i>T</i><sub>1/2λz</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>max</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>AUC</i><sub>last</sub> were 0.07 ± 0.01/h, 11.00 ± 2.57 h, 50.88 ± 31.94 ng/mL, 9.08 ± 11.57 h and 836.48 ± 230.53 ng h/mL, respectively.",2024-10-10
39622844,A novel small molecule Enpp1 inhibitor improves tumor control following radiation therapy by targeting stromal Enpp1 expression.,"The uniqueness in each person's cancer cells and variation in immune infiltrates means that each tumor represents a unique problem, but therapeutic targets can be found among their shared features. Radiation therapy alters the interaction between the cancer cells and the stroma through release of innate adjuvants. The extranuclear DNA that can result from radiation damage of cells can result in production of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). In turn, cGAMP can activate the innate sensor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), resulting in innate immune activation. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (Enpp1) is a phosphodiesterase that can be expressed by cancer cells that can degrade cGAMP, thus can decrease or block STING activation following radiation therapy, impairing the innate immunity that is critical to support adaptive immune control of tumors. We observed that many human and murine cancer cells lack Enpp1 expression, but that Enpp1 is expressed in cells of the tumor stroma where it limits tumor control by radiation therapy. We demonstrate in preclinical models the efficacy of a novel Enpp1 inhibitor and show that this inhibitor improves tumor control by radiation even where the cancer cells lack Enpp1. This mechanism requires STING and type I interferon (IFN) receptor expression by non-cancer cells and is dependent on CD8 T cells as a final effector mechanism of tumor control. This suggests that Enpp1 inhibition may be an effective partner for radiation therapy regardless of whether cancer cells express Enpp1. This broadens the potential patient base for whom Enpp1 inhibitors can be applied to improve innate immune responses following radiation therapy.",2024-12-02
39616835,Identification and validation of WDR5 WIN-site ligands via DNA-encoded chemical library screening.,"WD repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5) is a scaffolding protein involved in critical protein-protein interactions and a promising target for therapeutic development. Novel small-molecule ligands targeting WDR5 were identified using the DELopen platform, a free-access DNA-encoded chemical library (DEL) for academic research. Through off-DNA structure-activity relationship studies and photoaffinity labeling, two promising initial leads, DBL-6-13 and DBL-6-33, were identified as new binders of WDR5. These compounds exhibited moderate to good binding affinities and were confirmed to bind the WIN-site through co-crystal structure analysis. Our findings demonstrate the utility of DEL technology in identifying ligands for challenging targets like WDR5, particularly within an academic research setting using the DELopen platform. The identified WDR5 ligands offer a foundation for further optimization and exploration as chemical probes for WDR5 research.",2024-11-22

The current gold standard for differentiating between CD and UC involves endoscopy and histology, which are invasive and costly. We aimed to identify blood plasma proteomic signatures using a Protein-Wide Association Study (PWAS) approach to differentiate CD from UC and evaluate the efficacy of these signatures as features in machine learning (ML) classifiers.",2024-11-13
39605664,Machine learning application to predict binding affinity between peptide containing non-canonical amino acids and HLA0201.,"Class 1 major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I), encoded by the highly polymorphic HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genes in humans, are expressed on all nucleated cells. Both self and foreign proteins are processed to peptides of 8 to 10 amino acids, loaded into MCH-1 within the endoplasmic reticulum and then presented on the cell surface. Foreign peptides presented in this fashion activate CD8+ T cells and their immunogenicity correlates with their affinity for the MHC-1 binding groove. Thus, predicting antigen binding affinity for MHC-I is a valuable tool for identifying potentially immunogenic antigens. While quite a few predictors for MHC-I binding exist, there are no currently available tools that can predict antigen/MHC-I binding affinity for antigens with explicitly labeled post-translational modifications or unusual/non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs). However, such modifications are increasingly recognized as critical mediators of peptide immunogenicity. In this work, we propose a machine learning application that quantifies the binding affinity of epitopes containing NCAAs to MHC-I and compares its performance with other commonly used regressors. Our model demonstrates robust performance, with 5-fold cross-validation yielding an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.477 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.735, indicating strong predictive capability for peptides with NCAAs. This work provides a valuable tool for the computational design and optimization of peptides incorporating NCAAs, potentially accelerating the development of novel peptide-based therapeutics with enhanced properties and efficacy.",2024-11-21
39603569,Activating Esterase D by PFD5 exerts antiviral effect through inhibiting glutathionization of LAMP1 during Senecavirus A infection.,"Seneca virus A (SVA) is a newly discovered small nucleic acid virus, which can cause swine blister disease (PVD). Currently, there is no drug or vaccine. Studies have shown that SVA relies on the endolysosomal pathway to accomplish intracellular transport and release, and can disrupt lysosomal homeostasis, but its specific mechanism has not been revealed. At present, there is limited research on vaccines and antiviral drugs for it. Esterase D (ESD), a serine hydrolase, is active against many substrates and plays a role in inhibiting viral replication. However, the specific mechanism of the thioesterase activity of ESD in the signaling pathway is unknown. In this study, we synthesized and screened a novel small-molecule ESD activator, FPD5 (4-chloro-2-(5-phenyl-1-(pyridin-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro- 1h -pyrazol-3-yl)phenyl), capable of inhibiting the replication of SVA. To explore the mechanism of action of this process, we demonstrated the direct interaction between ESD and lysosomal membrane protein-1 (LAMP1) by CO-IP; Western blot revealed that FPD5 could activate ESD and exert a protective effect on LAMP1 and lysosomes. The deglutathionization function of ESD was verified by protein glutathione immunoblotting and detection reagents, and the affected cysteine residues were found by point mutation technique. The results showed that FPD5 activated ESD to exert thioesterase activity, reduced glutathionylation cysteine 375 in the LAMP1 and decreased SVA production. This study provides a theoretical basis for the development of small molecule drugs against SVA, and also suggests that the activation of the thioesterase activity of ESD is a new direction for future antiviral drug development.",2024-11-26
39598810,"Novel Peptide Analogues of Valorphin-Conjugated 1,8-Naphthalimide as Photodynamic Antimicrobial Agent in Solution and on Cotton Fabric.","For the first time, N-modified analogues of VV-hemorphin-5 (Valorphin) were synthesised and conjugated with three different 4-substitured-1,8-naphthalimides (H-NVal without substituent, Cl-NVal with chloro-substituent, and NO<sub>2</sub>-NVal with nitro-substituent). Cotton fabric was modified with these peptides by soaking it in their ethanol solution, and the colourimetric properties of the obtained fabric were measured. The fluorescent analysis shows that peptide immobilisation on a solid matrix as fabric decreases the molecule flexibility and spectrum maxima shift bathocromically with the appearance of a vibrational structure. The peptides' contact antimicrobial activity, and the resulting fabrics, have been investigated against model Gram-positive <i>B. cereus</i> and Gram-negative <i>P. aeruginos</i> bacteria. For the first time, the influence of light on bacterial inactivation was investigated by antibacterial photodynamic therapy of similar peptides. Slightly more pronounced activity in liquid media and after deposition on the cotton fabric was obtained for the peptide containing 4-nitro-1,8-naphthalimide compared to the other two peptides. Immobilisation of a peptide on the surface of fibres reduces their antimicrobial activity since their mobility is essential for good contact with bacteria. Cotton fabrics can be used in medical practice to produce antibacterial dressings and materials.",2024-11-17
39596331,Small Molecule Inhibitors of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Topoisomerase I Identified by Machine Learning and In Vitro Assays.,"Tuberculosis (TB) caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> is a leading infectious cause of death globally. The treatment of patients becomes much more difficult for the increasingly common multi-drug resistant TB. Topoisomerase I is essential for the viability of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and has been validated as a new target for the discovery of novel treatment against TB resistant to the currently available drugs. Virtual high-throughput screening based on machine learning was used in this study to identify small molecules that target the binding site of divalent ion near the catalytic tyrosine of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> topoisomerase I. From the virtual screening of more than 2 million commercially available compounds, 96 compounds were selected for testing in topoisomerase I relaxation activity assay. The top hit that has IC<sub>50</sub> of 7 µM was further investigated. Commercially available analogs of the top hit were purchased and tested with the in vitro enzyme assay to gain further insights into the molecular scaffold required for topoisomerase inhibition. Results from this project demonstrated that novel small molecule inhibitors of bacterial topoisomerase I can be identified starting with the machine-learning-based virtual screening approach.",2024-11-15
39593108,Characterization of novel small molecule inhibitors of estrogen receptor-activation function 2 (ER-AF2).,"Up to 40% of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer will develop resistance against the majority of current ER-directed therapies. Resistance can arise through various mechanisms such as increased expression levels of coregulators, and key mutations acquired in the receptor's ligand binding domain rendering it constitutively active. To overcome these resistance mechanisms, we explored targeting the ER Activation Function 2 (AF2) site, which is essential for coactivator binding and activation. Using artificial intelligence and the deep docking methodology, we virtually screened > 1 billion small molecules and identified 290 potential AF2 binders that were then characterized and validated through an iterative screening pipeline of cell-based and cell-free assays. We ranked the compounds based on their ability to reduce the transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor and the viability of ER-positive breast cancer cells. We identified a lead compound, VPC-260724, which inhibits ER activity at low micromolar range. We confirmed its direct binding to the ER-AF2 site through a PGC1α peptide displacement experiment. Using proximity ligation assays, we showed that VPC-260724 disrupts the interaction between ER-AF2 and the coactivator SRC-3 and reduces the expression of ER target genes in various breast cancer models including the tamoxifen resistant cell line TamR3. In conclusion, we developed a novel ER-AF2 binder, VPC-260724, which shows antiproliferative activity in ER-positive breast cancer models. The use of an ER-AF2 inhibitor in combination with current treatments may provide a novel complementary therapeutic approach to target treatment resistance in ER-positive breast cancer.",2024-11-26
39591876,Discovery of 3-(2-aminobenzo[d]thiazol-5-yl) benzamide derivatives as potent anticancer agents via ROR1 inhibition.,"Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, which was overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and essential for cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Recently, accumulating evidences indicated that ROR1 played a critical role in maintaining the balance between the Src survival pathway and the p38 apoptotic pathway. Hence, ROR1 was considered as an attractive therapeutic target for the development of anticancer drugs. However, only a few small molecule ROR1 inhibitors were reported until now. Herein, a series of 3-(2-aminobenzo[d]thiazol-5-yl) benzamide derivatives were designed and synthesized via bioisosterism and simplification strategy guided by the lead compound 9a. MTT assay showed that compound 7h exhibited the best anti-cancer properties with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 18.16, 8.11 and 3.5 μM against A549, PC9 and H1975 cells, respectively. Meanwhile, the selectivity index (SI) of compound 7h for H1975 cells was 22.86 compared to that of the lead compound 9a of 1.83, which is at least 12 fold higher than that of lead compound 9a, suggesting that 7h had a favorable safety profile. In addition, the molecular docking, CETSA and DARTS assays suggested that compound 7h might be a novel small molecule ROR1 inhibitor. More importantly, compound 7h significantly suppressed the migration and invasion of H1975 cells in vitro by blocking Src survival pathway and reactivating the p38 apoptotic pathway, and induced H1975 cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Collectively, our work suggested that the ROR1 inhibitor 7h might be a novel drug candidate for NSCLC treatment.",2024-11-20
39591692,"Trametinib and M17, a novel small molecule inhibitor of AKT, display a synergistic antitumor effect in triple negative breast cancer cells through the AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways.","Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with a poor prognosis and limited response to traditional chemotherapy, necessitating the exploration of novel treatment approaches. Recent researches have highlighted the interconnected roles of the PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK pathway in TNBC cells, contributing to the efficacy of treatments. Therefore, the concurrent inhibition of both pathways presents a potential new therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients. This study aimed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of M17, an AKT allosteric inhibitor and a new synthesized shikonin derivative, both alone and in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. We applied various cellular assays and a subcutaneous 4T1 tumor bearing BALB/c mice model were utilized to assess the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects. Computational docking and Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) were employed to investigate the binding of M17 with AKT. Additionally, flow cytometry, transwell assays, western blotting, and tumor xenograft assays were conducted to explore the potential synergistic mechanisms of the combined therapy. The results demonstrated that M17 exhibited moderate antitumor activity against TNBC cells, but significantly enhanced the apoptotic effects and inhibited proliferation and migration when combined with trametinib. Furthermore, the combination of M17 and trametinib showed even more pronounced antitumor activity in vivo. Mechanistically, the dual therapy synergistically suppressed TNBC by targeting the AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK signaling pathways and inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, the findings suggested that the combination of M17 and trametinib holds promise as a synergistic treatment option for TNBC patients.",2024-11-22
39582305,Production of novel peptide-targeting antibodies for anti-Müllerian hormone receptor 2 and induction of cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells.,"Ovarian cancer is generally diagnosed at late stages. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting antigens in ovarian cancer are used in the clinic. Anti-Müllerian hormone receptor type 2 (AMHR2) is a receptor highly expressed in ovarian cancer and it is a potential target antigen for immunotherapy. Extracellular domain of AMHR2 was analysed in terms of 3D structure and physicochemical properties, and 3 peptide sequences (Peptides 1, 7 and 11) were determined as targets. MAb production protocol was performed, and 6 MAb clones showing high affinity for peptides were obtained. P3B1, P10A10, P10B6 and P2A6 clones were for peptide 11 (P11), P2C9 was for P7, and P6C5 was for P1. Antibody isotype of P2A6 was IgG2a and the others were of IgG1 isotype. MAb binding to the native recombinant protein (AMHR2-Fc) was analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and MAb binding to AMHR2 expressed by SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells was analysed by western blot and immunofluorescent staining. P3B1 showed strong, P10A10, P10B6 and P2C9 showed medium affinity for the native protein (AMHR2-Fc). P3B1 and P2C9 showed strong binding in western blot analysis. Clones showed moderate binding in immunoflorescent staining. A complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) experiment was conducted using MAbs and transfected SKOV-3 cells. P3B1 induced a significant CDC. Variable regions of P3B1 MAb were sequenced. In conclusion, MAbs for three different regions of AMHR2 were produced. One clone was shown to induce cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells and its sequence was determined for future use as a humanised therapeutic MAb.",2024-11-25
39580542,"Ibetazol, a novel inhibitor of importin β1-mediated nuclear import.","Nucleocytoplasmatic transport plays an essential role in eukaryotic cell homeostasis and is mediated by karyopherins. Importin β1 (KPNB1) and its adaptor protein importin α1 (KPNA2) are the best-characterized karyopherins that effect nuclear import. Here, we identify a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the importin β1-mediated nuclear import. We design a reporter cell line by stably tagging endogenous importin α1 with a fluorescent protein to screen for compounds affecting its subcellular localization. We identify a series of compounds that trigger cytoplasmatic accumulation of importin α1. The lead compound, ibetazol, is further characterized in a broad sequence of cellular nuclear transport assays. Ibetazol is shown to inhibit all importin β1-mediated nuclear import quickly and specifically, without affecting transport mediated by other karyopherins. Detailed molecular mechanism of action studies demonstrate that ibetazol inhibits importin β1 by covalently targeting Cys585. In summary, ibetazol is a novel small molecule inhibitor of importin β1 enabling pharmacological inhibition of the importin β1-mediated nuclear import process with wide applicability in different fields.",2024-11-23
39578293,Identification and interaction mechanism of novel small molecule antagonists targeting CC chemokine receptor 1/3/5 for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.,"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) was one of the most prevalent forms of lung cancer. Due to its ease of invasion and migration, the five-year survival rate was relatively low. Therefore, new strategies for NSCLC treatment were needed. CC chemokine receptor 1/3/5 (CCR1/CCR3/CCR5), a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family, could promote the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by binding to related chemokines. Consequently, targeting CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 might prevent the progression of the disease. So far, no compound had been reported as a common antagonist for CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5. In this research, we utilized virtual screening and structural optimization to obtain compound 5, which effectively inhibited the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Meanwhile, Western Blot and Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) manifested that compound 5 suppressed migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by suppressing the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the consequently decreased Matrix Metalloproteinase-9(MMP-9) secretion. Moreover, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) experiment and molecular simulations confirmed that compound 5 was capable of binding with CCR1/CCR3/CCR5, and Van der Waals forces were instrumental in the binding process. Ile91, Tyr113, Gln284, and Ser184(CCR1-ligand5), Ile189, Met213, and Leu209(CCR3-ligand5), Phe109, Gln194, and Thr195(CCR5-ligand5) had Van der Waals interactions with ligand 5. Dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) and free energy landscape (FEL) showed that compound 5 could stably bind to CCR1/CCR3/CCR5 to change conformation of the protein and the tendency of residue movements, leading to a persistent inhibitory effect. This study aimed to provide assistance in the rational design of common antagonists for CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5.",2024-11-22
39569500,S100A1ct: A Synthetic Peptide Derived From S100A1 Protein Improves Cardiac Performance and Survival in Preclinical Heart Failure Models.,The EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein S100A1 has been identified as a molecular regulator and enhancer of cardiac performance. The ability of S100A1 to recognize and modulate the activity of targets such as SERCA2a (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase) and RyR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) in cardiomyocytes has mostly been ascribed to its hydrophobic C-terminal α-helix (residues 75-94). We hypothesized that a synthetic peptide consisting of residues 75 through 94 of S100A1 and an N-terminal solubilization tag (S100A1ct) could mimic the performance-enhancing effects of S100A1 and may be suitable as a peptide therapeutic to improve the function of diseased hearts.,2024-11-21
39562696,The antitumor peptide M1-20 induced the degradation of CDK1 through CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1-involved ubiquitination.,"CDK1 is an oncogenic serine/threonine kinase known to play an important role in the regulation of the cell cycle. FOXM1, as one of the CDK1 substrates, requires binding of CDK1/CCNB1 complex for phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of p300/CBP coactivators to mediate transcriptional activity. Previous studies from our laboratory found that a novel peptide (M1-20) derived from the C-terminus of FOXM1 exhibited potent inhibitory effects for cancer cells. Based on these proofs and to explore the inhibitory mechanism of M1-20, we designed experiments and found that CDK1 served as an important target of M1-20. M1-20 enhanced the ubiquitination and degradation of CDK1 by CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1 complexes through the proteasome pathway. M1-20 could also affect the formation of CDK1/CCNB1 complexes. In addition, compared to RO3306, a CDK1 inhibitor, M1-20 exhibited excellent inhibitory effects in FVB/N MMTV-PyVT murine model of spontaneous breast cancer. These results suggested that M1-20 was a potential CDK1 inhibitor for the treatment of cancer.",2024-11-20
39558858,Androgen receptor inhibitors in treating prostate cancer.,"Androgens play an important role in prostate cancer development and progression. Androgen action is mediated through the androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent DNA-binding transcription factor. AR is arguably the most important target for prostate cancer treatment. Current USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved AR inhibitors target the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and have exhibited efficacy in prostate cancer patients, particularly when used in combination with androgen deprivation therapy. Unfortunately, patients treated with the currently approved AR-targeting agents develop resistance and relapse with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The major mechanism leading to CRPC involves reactivation of AR signaling mainly through AR gene amplification, mutation, and/or splice variants. To effectively inhibit the reactivated AR signaling, new approaches to target AR are being actively explored. These new approaches include novel small molecule inhibitors targeting various domains of AR and agents that can degrade AR. The present review provides a summary of the existing FDA-approved AR antagonists and the current development of some of the AR targeting agents.",2024-11-19
39551117,Prostate-specific membrane antigen as target for vasculature-directed therapeutic strategies in solid tumors.,"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is one of the few biomarkers which has been successfully translated to the clinic as theranostic biomarker for patients with prostate cancer. In the context of prostate cancer, PSMA is overexpressed on the cell membrane of tumor cells, making it a viable target for interventions with urea-based small molecule inhibitors or antibodies conjugated to radioactive isotopes. Interestingly, in several non-prostatic cancers, expression of PSMA appears to be associated with the tumor neovasculature. This offers novel therapeutic opportunities for treatments targeting the vasculature in non-prostatic cancers. In this review, we discuss PSMA and its potential as target for vasculature-directed therapeutic approaches, including radioligand therapy, fusion protein vaccination and CAR T-cell therapy.",2024-11-17
39537125,"Neurotranscriptomic and behavioral effects of ISRIB, and its therapeutic effects in the traumatic brain injury model in zebrafish.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global medical concern and has a lasting impact on brain activity with high risks of mortality. Current treatments are inadequate for repairing damaged brain cells or correcting cognitive and behavioral disabilities in TBI patients. Mounting evidence links TBI to the activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) signaling in the brain. A novel small molecule, ISRIB, is an effective inhibitor of the ISR pathway, offering potential advantages for brain health. Here, we investigated how ISRIB affects brain transcriptome and behavior in zebrafish TBI model evoked by telencephalic brain injury. Overall, while TBI diminished memory and social behavior in zebrafish, administering ISRIB post-injury markedly reduced these behavioral deficits, and modulated brain gene expression, rescuing TBI-activated pathways related to inflammation and brain cell development. Collectively, this supports the role of brain ISR in TBI, and suggests potential utility of ISRIB for the treatment of TBI-related states.",2024-11-12

In our previous study, we reported on the discovery of D347-2761, a novel small-molecule inhibitor that specifically targets the unstable domain of c-Myc and disrupts the c-Myc/Max heterodimer. To enhance targeted therapies further, we conducted an extensive structural analysis and designed a series of innovative benzimidazole derivatives. The cytotoxic activities of these compounds were assessed using the CCK-8 assay, revealing that compound A1 displayed IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.32 μM and 11.39 μM against the A549 and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cell lines, respectively, while compound A5 exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.08 μM and 7.86 μM against the same cell lines. Our findings revealed that compounds A1 and A5 exhibited potent anticancer activity by disrupting the interaction between c-Myc and Max proteins, leading to the downregulation of c-Myc protein levels and induction of apoptosis through apoptotic pathways. Notably, compound A5 demonstrated superior inhibitory capacity compared to other compounds tested. Furthermore, in a syngeneic tumor model, compound A5 exhibited excellent efficacy with a tumor growth inhibition rate reaching up to 76.4 %, accompanied by a significant reduction in c-Myc protein expression levels.

This study introduces a novel small-molecule inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT-1), referred to as DI-1, designed to synergize with HER2 antagonists in treating HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Clinical data reveal a negative correlation between DNMT-1 expression and PTEN levels, and a positive correlation with the methylation rates of PTEN's promoter. In experiments with SKBR3 and BT474 cells, DI-1 effectively reduced the methylation of PTEN's promoter region, thereby upregulating PTEN expression. This upregulation, in turn, enhanced the cells' sensitivity to HER2 antagonists, indicating that DI-1's mechanism involves inhibiting DNMT-1's recruitment to PTEN's promoter region. Consequently, by increasing PTEN expression, DI-1 amplifies the sensitivity of HER2-positive breast cancer cells to treatment, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic strategy in this context.",2024-11-11
39521886,Nuclear EGFR in breast cancer suppresses NK cell recruitment and cytotoxicity.,"Natural Killer (NK) cells can target and destroy cancer cells, yet tumor microenvironments typically suppress NK cell recruitment and cytotoxicity. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a potent oncogene that can activate survival, migration, and proliferation pathways, and clinical data suggests it may also play an immunomodulating role in cancers. Recent work has demonstrated a novel role for nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) in regulating transcriptional events unique from the kinase domain. Using a novel peptide therapeutic (cSNX1.3) that inhibits retrograde trafficking of EGFR and an EGFR nuclear localization mutant, we discovered that nEGFR suppresses NK cell recruitment and cytotoxicity. RNA-Seq analysis of breast cancer cells treated with cSNX1.3 or modified to lack a nuclear localization sequence (EGFR<sup>ΔNLS</sup>) revealed the EGF-dependent induction of NK activating receptor ligands, while kinase inhibition by erlotinib did not impact these genes. NanoString analysis of tumor-bearing WAP-TGFα transgenic mice treated with cSNX1.3 demonstrated an increase in immune cell populations and activating genes. Additionally, immunohistochemistry confirmed an increase in NK cells upon cSNX1.3 treatment. Finally, cSNX1.3 treatment was found to enhance NK cell recruitment and cytotoxicity in vitro. Together, the data demonstrate a unique immunomodulatory role for nEGFR.",2024-11-09
39521064,Enhanced CRISPR-Cas9 RNA system delivery using cell penetrating peptides-based nanoparticles for efficient in vitro and in vivo applications.,"CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a revolutionary gene-editing tool with huge therapeutic potential for addressing the underlying genetic causes of various diseases, including cancer. However, there are challenges such as the delivery method that must be overcome for its clinical application. In addition to the risk of nuclease degradation and rapid clearance of the CRISPR-Cas9 system by macrophages, the large size of Cas9, the high anionic charge density and hydrophilic nature of the RNA hinder their intracellular delivery and overall gene transfection efficiency. In this study, we engineered a novel Peptide-Based Nanoparticles ADGN for the delivery of long RNA. ADGN peptides can form stable self-assembled nanoparticles with CRISPR-Cas9 RNA. They have the ability to cross the cell membrane of various cell types, exhibiting a preference for cancer cells that overexpress laminin receptor and safeguard RNA prior their delivery into the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that ADGN peptides significantly promote CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of the luciferase gene in vitro achieving 60 % efficiency with a preference for G insertion at the targeted site of luciferase gene. Moreover, we have provided evidence that these nanoparticles can also be systemically intravenously administrated in vivo in mice to deliver a functional CRISPR-Cas9 system to tumoral lung cells orthotopically implanted in the mouse, resulting in an effective gene knockout in mice. We also demonstrated that the in vivo distribution of ADGN-RNA is influenced by its peptides to RNA molar ratio. This study introduces a promising new Peptide-Based Nanoparticles for delivering CRISPR-Cas9 system in its RNA form applicable in both in vitro and in vivo models.",2024-11-11
39519786,Discovery of Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors Targeted on TNFα-TNFR1 from Computational Design and Bioactivity Verification.,"Activating tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is one of the key pathological mechanisms resulting in the exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) immune response. Despite various types of drugs being available for the treatment of RA, a series of shortcomings still limits their application. Therefore, developing novel peptide drugs that target TNFα-TNFR1 interaction is expected to expand therapeutic drug options. In this study, the detailed interaction mechanism between TNFα and TNFR1 was elucidated, based on which, a series of linear peptides were initially designed. To overcome its large conformational flexibility, two different head-to-tail cyclization strategies were adopted by adding a proline-glycine (GP) or cysteine-cysteine (CC) to form an amide or disulfide bond between the N-C terminal. The results indicate that two cyclic peptides, R1_CC4 and α_CC8, exhibit the strongest binding free energies. α_CC8 was selected for further optimization using virtual mutations through in vitro activity and toxicity experiments due to its optimal biological activity. The L16R mutant was screened, and its binding affinity to TNFR1 was validated using ELISA assays. This study designed a novel cyclic peptide structure with potential anti-inflammatory properties, possibly bringing an additional choice for the treatment of RA in the future.",2024-10-31
39519378,"Development and Evaluation of ABI-171, a New Fluoro-Catechin Derivative, for the Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.","The persistent challenge of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), characterized by disease progression and high mortality, underscores the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. We have developed a novel small molecule-catechin derivative ABI-171-selectively targeting dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) and proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) kinases, crucial in the pathogenesis of fibrotic processes. We employed the Bleomycin-induced (intratracheal) mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ABI-171. Mice with induced PF were treated QD with ABI-171, either prophylactically or therapeutically, using oral and intranasal routes. Pirfenidone (100 mg/kg, TID) and Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, 100 mg/kg, QD), a natural catechin currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial, were used as reference compounds. ABI-171, administered prophylactically, led to a significant reduction in hydroxyproline levels and fibrotic tissue formation compared to the control group. Treatment with ABI-171 improved body weight, indicating mitigation of disease-related weight loss. Additionally, ABI-171 demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity, reducing lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration. In the therapeutic setting, ABI-171, administered 7 days post-induction, reduced mortality rates (<i>p</i> = 0.04) compared with the bleomycin and EGCG control groups. ABI-171 also ameliorated the severity of lung injuries assessed by improved Masson's trichrome scores when administered both orally and intranasally. ABI-171 significantly decreases bleomycin-induced PF and improves survival in mice, showcasing promising therapeutic potential beyond current medications like pirfenidone and EGCG for patients with IPF. Based on these results, further studies with ABI-171 are ongoing in preclinical studies.",2024-11-04
39513867,p70S6K as a Potential Anti-COVID-19 Target: Insights from Wet Bench and In Silico Studies.,"The onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2019 sparked a global COVID-19 pandemic. This infection is marked by a significant rise in both viral and host kinase activity. Our primary objective was to identify a pivotal host kinase essential for COVID-19 infection and the associated phenomenon of the cytokine storm, which may lead to long-term COVID-19 complications irrespective of viral genetic variations. To achieve this, our study tracked kinase phosphorylation dynamics in RAW264.7 macrophages following SPIKE transfection over time. Among the kinases surveyed, p70S6K (RPS6KB1) exhibited a 3.5-fold increase in phosphorylation at S418. This significant change prompted the selection of p70S6K for in silico investigation, utilizing its structure bound to M2698 (PDB: 7N93). M2698, an oral dual Akt/p70S6K inhibitor with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.1 nM, exhibited psychosis side effects in phase I clinical trials, potentially linked to its interaction with Akt2. Our secondary objective was to discover a small-molecule analogue of M2698 that exhibits a distinct binding preference for p70S6K over Akt2 through computational modeling and analysis. The in silico part of our project began with validating the prediction accuracy of the docking algorithm, followed by an OCA analysis pinpointing specific atoms on M2698 that could be modified to enhance selectivity. Subsequently, our investigation led to the identification of an analog of M2698, designated as S34, that showed a superior docking score towards p70S6K compared to Akt2. To further assess the stability of S34 in its protein-ligand (PL) complexes with p70S6K and Akt2, MD simulations were conducted. These simulations suggest that S34, on average, forms two hydrogen bond interactions with p70S6K, whereas it only forms one hydrogen bond interaction with Akt2. This difference in hydrogen bond interactions likely contributed to the observed larger root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.3 nm in the S34-Akt2 complex, compared to 0.1 nm in the S34-p70S6K complex. Additionally, we calculated free binding energy to predict the strength of the binding interactions of S34 to p70S6K and Akt2, which showed ~2-fold favorable binding affinity of S34 in the p70S6K binding pocket compared to that in the Akt2 binding pocket. These observations may suggest that the S34-p70S6K complex is more stable than the S34-Akt2 complex. Our work focused on identifying a host kinase target and predicting the binding affinity of a novel small molecule to accelerate the development of effective treatments. The wet bench results specifically highlight p70S6K as a compelling anti-COVID-19 target. Meanwhile, our in silico investigations address the known off-target effects associated with M2698 by identifying a close analog called S34. In conclusion, this study presents novel and intriguing findings that could potentially lead to clinical applications with further investigations.",2024-10-24
39511877,"A novel small molecule phagocytosis inhibitor, KB-208, ameliorates ITP in mouse models with similar efficacy as IVIG.","The characteristic feature of immune cytopenias involves the process of extravascular phagocytosis, wherein macrophages in the spleen and/or liver engage in the destruction of blood cells that have been opsonized by auto- or alloantibodies. Therefore, new treatments that prevent phagocytosis will be advantageous, especially for short-term usage along with alternative options.",2024-11-07
39489212,Engraftment of a surrogate antigen onto tumor cell surface via pHLIP peptide to universally target CAR-T cell therapy to solid tumors.,"CAR-T cells and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are immunotherapeutics that have shown efficacies against certain malignancies. However, their broad application is hindered by the scarcity of tumor-associated antigens on tumor cell surfaces. Previous investigations unveiled the unique capacity of pH-low insertion peptide (pHLIP) to anchor to plasma membranes under acidic conditions. Considering that an acidic tumor microenvironment is a hallmark of solid tumors, we engineered a novel peptide, Myc-pHLIP, by tethering a surrogate epitope tag, the c-Myc-tag, to pHLIP. We evaluated the efficiency of Myc-pHLIP in inserting the artificial c-Myc-tag onto the plasma membrane of malignant cells and determined if this engraftment could convert it into a therapeutic target for CAR-T cells or mAbs. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that incubating Myc-pHLIP with tumor cells in acidic media triggered significant killing by either Myc-targeted CAR-T cells (Myc-CAR-T), or by an anti-Myc mAb in the presence of NK cells. In vivo studies demonstrated substantial antitumor effects with sequential administration of Myc-pHLIP followed by either Myc-CAR-T or Myc-mAb. These findings establish that Myc-pHLIP has the potential to act as a universal surrogate tumor antigen capable of directing CAR-T cells or mAbs to treat any solid tumors by concurrently targeting both malignant and stromal cells.",2024-11-01
39485774,A novel small molecule screening assay using normal human chondrocytes toward osteoarthritis drug discovery.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and a leading cause of pain and disability in adults. A central feature is progressive cartilage degradation and matrix fragment formation driven by the excessive production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-13, by articular chondrocytes. Inflammatory factors, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), are secreted into the joint by synovial fibroblasts, and can contribute to pain and inflammation. No therapeutic exists that addresses the underlying loss of joint tissue in OA. To address this, we developed and utilized a cell-based high-throughput OA drug discovery platform using normal human chondrocytes treated with a recombinant fragment of the matrix protein fibronectin (FN-f) as a catabolic stimulus relevant to OA pathogenesis and a readout using a fluorescent MMP-13 responsive probe. The goal was to test this screening platform by identifying compounds that inhibited FN-f-induced MMP-13 production and determine if these compounds also inhibited catabolic signaling in OA chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts. Two pilot screens of 1344 small molecules revealed five ""hits"" that strongly inhibited FN-f induced MMP-13 production with low cytotoxicity. These included RO-3306 (CDK1 inhibitor (i)), staurosporine (PKCi), trametinib (MEK1 and MEK2i), GSK-626616 (DYRK3i), and edicotinib (CSF-1Ri). Secondary testing using immunoblots and cells derived from OA joint tissues confirmed the ability of selected compounds to inhibit chondrocyte MMP-13 production and FN-f stimulated IL-6 production by synovial fibroblasts. These findings support the use of this high throughput screening assay for discovery of disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs.",2024-11-01
39482595,Efficacy and safety of surufatinib in the treatment of patients with neuroendocrine tumor: a real-world study in Chinese population.,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare neoplasms that originate from peptidergic neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Due to their increasing incidence, effective treatment strategies are required. Surufatinib, a novel small-molecule inhibitor with antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory effects, has shown promise in clinical trials for advanced NETs. However, the efficacy and safety of surufatinib are influenced by multiple factors, and there is currently a lack of sufficient real-world studies to explore these potential influencing factors.",2024-10-31
39481183,The application of PROTACs in immune-inflammation diseases.,"Immune-inflammatory diseases are a class of conditions with high prevalence that severely impact the quality of life. Current treatment strategies include immunosuppressants, glucocorticoids, and monoclonal antibodies. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as poor membrane permeability, immunogenicity, and the requirement for injection in large molecule drugs. Small molecule compounds, on the other hand, suffer from issues like poor selectivity, inability to inhibit non-enzymatic functions, and biological compensation. These factors constrain the effectiveness of current therapeutic strategies in immune-inflammatory diseases. As a novel small molecule drug development technology, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) regulate protein levels by inducing interactions between target proteins and E3 ubiquitin ligases, leading to the selective degradation of target proteins. This technology has already shown promising therapeutic effects in the treatment of immune-inflammatory diseases. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the application of PROTAC technology in the field of immune inflammation and provide insights into its potential in treating immune-inflammatory diseases.",2024-10-26
39475096,PRR adjuvants restrain high stability peptides presentation on APCs.,"Adjuvants can affect APCs function and boost adaptive immune responses post-vaccination. However, whether they modulate the specificity of immune responses, particularly immunodominant epitope responses, and the mechanisms of regulating antigen processing and presentation remain poorly defined. Here, using overlapping synthetic peptides, we screened the dominant epitopes of Th1 responses in mice post-vaccination with different adjuvants and found that the adjuvants altered the antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell immunodominant epitope hierarchy. MHC-II immunopeptidomes demonstrated that the peptide repertoires presented by APCs were significantly altered by the adjuvants. Unexpectedly, no novel peptide presentation was detected after adjuvant treatment, whereas peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II presented in the control group were missing after adjuvant stimulation, particularly in the MPLA- and CpG-stimulated groups. The low-stability peptide present in the adjuvant groups effectively elicited robust T-cell responses and formed immune memory. Collectively, our results suggest that adjuvants (MPLA and CpG) inhibit high-stability peptide presentation instead of revealing cryptic epitopes, which may alter the specificity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-dominant epitope responses. The capacity of adjuvants to modify peptide-MHC (pMHC) stability and antigen-specific T-cell immunodominant epitope responses has fundamental implications for the selection of suitable adjuvants in the vaccine design process and epitope vaccine development.",2024-10-30
39468211,Machine learning-guided synthesis of nanomaterials for breast cancer therapy.,"Breast cancer is a common malignant tumor, which mostly occurs in female population and is caused by excessive proliferation of breast epithelial cells. Breast cancer can cause nipple discharge, breast lumps and other symptoms, but these symptoms lack certain specificity and are easily confused with other diseases, thus affecting the early treatment of the disease. Once the tumor progresses to the advanced stage, distant metastasis can occur, leading to dysfunction of the affected organs, and even threatening the patients' lives. In this study, we synthesized high drug-loading gel particles and applied them to control the release of insoluble drugs. This method is simple to prepare, cost-effective, and validates their potential in breast cancer therapy. We first characterized the morphology and physicochemical properties of gel loaded with newly synthesized compound 1 by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Using newly synthesized insoluble compound 1 as a model drug, its efficacy in treating breast cancer was investigated. The results showed that hydrogel@compound 1 was able to significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Additionally, we utilized machine learning to screen three structurally similar compounds, which showed promising therapeutic effects, providing a new approach for the development of novel small-molecule drugs.",2024-10-28
39466714,Discovery of Highly Bioactive Peptides through Hierarchical Structural Information and Molecular Dynamics Simulations.,"Peptide drugs play an essential role in modern therapeutics, but the computational design of these molecules is hindered by several challenges. Traditional methods like molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, as well as recent deep learning approaches, often face limitations related to computational resource demands, complex binding affinity assessments, extensive data requirements, and poor model interpretability. Here, we introduce <i>PepHiRe</i>, an innovative methodology that utilizes the hierarchical structural information in peptide sequences and employs a novel strategy called Ladderpath, rooted in algorithmic information theory, to rapidly generate and enhance the efficiency and clarity of novel peptide design. We applied <i>PepHiRe</i> to develop BH3-like peptide inhibitors targeting myeloid cell leukemia-1, a protein associated with various cancers. By analyzing just eight known bioactive BH3 peptide sequences, <i>PepHiRe</i> effectively derived a hierarchy of subsequences used to create new BH3-like peptides. These peptides underwent screening through MD simulations, leading to the selection of five candidates for synthesis and subsequent in vitro testing. Experimental results demonstrated that these five peptides possess high inhibitory activity, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 28.13 ± 7.93 to 167.42 ± 22.15 nM. Our study explores a white-box model driven technique and a structured screening pipeline for identifying and generating novel peptides with potential bioactivity.",2024-10-28
39464529,Small Molecule Drug C381 Attenuates Brain Vascular Damage Following Repetitive Mild Traumatic Injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a significant public health concern, with no effective therapeutic interventions to ameliorate the enduring consequences. The prevailing understanding of TBI pathophysiology indicates a central role for vascular dysfunction. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine crucial for vascular development. Aberrant TGF-β signaling is implicated in vascular pathologies associated with various neurological conditions. We recently developed a novel small molecule drug, C381, a TGF-β activator with the ability to restore lysosomal function. Here we used a mouse model of repetitive mild TBI (mTBI) to examine whether C381 would attenuate vascular injury. We first employed RNA-seq analysis to investigate the gene expression patterns associated with mTBI and evaluated the therapeutic potential of C381 in mitigating these changes. Our results demonstrate distinct mTBI-related gene expression signatures, prominently implicating pathways related to vascular integrity and endothelial function. Notably, treatment with C381 reversed these mTBI-induced gene expression changes. Immunohistochemical analysis further corroborated these findings, revealing that C381 treatment attenuated vascular damage in mTBI-affected brain tissue. These findings strongly support the potential clinical usefulness of C381 as a novel therapeutic intervention for mTBI.",2024-10-22
39456264,A Novel Peptide from VP1 of EV-D68 Exhibits Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity Against Human Enteroviruses.,"Enteroviruses have been a historical concern since the identification of polioviruses in humans. Wild polioviruses have almost been eliminated, while multiple species of non-polio enteroviruses and their variants co-circulate annually. To date, at least 116 types have been found in humans and are grouped into the species Enterovirus A-D and Rhinovirus A-C. However, there are few available antiviral drugs, especially with a universal pharmaceutical effect. Here, we demonstrate that peptide P25 from EV-D68 has broad antiviral activity against EV A-D enteroviruses in vitro. P25, derived from the HI loop and β-I sheet of VP1, operates through a conserved hydrophilic motif -R---K-K--K- and the hydrophobic F near the N-terminus. It could prevent viral infection of EV-A71 by competing for the heparan sulfate (HS) receptor, binding and stabilizing virions by suppressing the release of the viral genome. P25 also inhibited the generation of infectious viral particles by reducing viral protein synthesis. The molecular docking revealed that P25 might bind to the pocket opening area, a potential target for broad-spectrum antivirals. Our findings implicate the multiple antiviral effects of peptide P25, including blocking viral binding to the HS receptor, impeding viral genome release, and reducing progeny particles, which could be a novel universal anti-enterovirus drug candidate.",2024-10-19

AI offers a range of computational tools and algorithms that enables researchers to accelerate the therapeutic peptide pipeline. This review explores the current landscape of AI applications in peptide drug discovery, highlighting its potential, challenges, and ethical considerations.

39454831,Evaluation of a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in translatable animals models.,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes severe respiratory infections and concomitant disease resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in infants, elderly, and immunocompromised adults. Vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and small-molecule antivirals are now either available or in development to prevent and treat RSV infections. Although rodent and non-rodent preclinical animal models have been used to evaluate these emerging agents, there is still a need to improve our understanding of the pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships within and between animal models to enable better design of human challenge studies and clinical trials. Herein, we report a PKPD evaluation of MRK-1, a novel small molecule non-nucleoside inhibitor of the RSV L polymerase protein, in the semi-permissive cotton rat and African green monkey models of RSV infection. These studies demonstrate a strong relationship between in vitro activity, in vivo drug exposure, and pharmacodynamic efficacy as well as revealing limitations of the cotton rat RSV model. Additionally, we report unexpected horizontal transmission of human RSV between co-housed African green monkeys, as well as a lack of drug specific resistant mutant generation. Taken together these studies further our understanding of these semi-permissive animal models and offer the potential for expansion of their preclinical utility in evaluating novel RSV therapeutic agents.",2024-10-23
39447523,Rational design of novel peptide-based vaccine against the emerging OZ virus.,"Oz virus (OZV) belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family which includes viruses with a negative-sense, single-stranded, and segmented RNA genome. OZV is a zoonotic pathogen, particularly since the virus can cause deadly illness when injected intracerebrally into nursing mice. OZV is an emerging pathogen with the potential to spark a pandemic as there is no preventive and licensed treatment against this virus. The goal of this study was to develop a novel multi-epitope vaccination against OZV proteins utilizing immunoinformatics and immunological simulation analysis. This work evaluated immunological epitopes (B cells, MHC-I, and MHC-II) to identify highly antigenic OZV target proteins. Shortlisted epitopes were joined together by using appropriate linkers and adjuvants to design multi-epitope vaccine constructs (MEVC). The vaccine models were designed, improved, validated, and the globular regions and post-translational modifications (PTMs) were also evaluated in the vaccine's structure. Molecular docking analysis with the Toll-like receptor (TLR4) showed strong interactions and appropriate binding energies. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirmed stable interactions between the vaccines and TLR4. Bioinformatics tools helped optimize codons, resulting in successful cloning into appropriate host vectors. This study showed that the developed vaccines are stable and non-allergenic in the human body and successfully stimulated immunological responses against OZV. Finally, a mechanism of action for the designed vaccine construct was also proposed. Further experimental validations of the designed vaccine construct will pave the way to create a potentially effective vaccine against this emerging pathogen.",2024-10-23
39426690,Targeting autophagy in urological system cancers: From underlying mechanisms to therapeutic implications.,"The urological system, including kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra and prostate is known to be vital for blood filtration, waste elimination and electrolyte balance. Notably, urological system cancers represent a significant portion of global cancer diagnoses and mortalities. The current therapeutic strategies for early-stage cancer primarily involve resection surgery, which significantly affects the quality of life of patients, whereas advanced-stage cancer often relies on less effective chemo- or radiotherapy. Recently, accumulating evidence has revealed that autophagy, a crucial process in which excess organelles or inclusions within cells are removed to maintain cell homeostasis, has numerous links to urological system cancers. In this review, we focus on summarizing the underlying two-sided mechanisms of autophagy in urological system cancers. We also review the current clinical drugs targeting autophagy, which demonstrate significant potential in improving treatment outcomes for urological system cancers. In addition, we provide an overview of the research status of novel small molecule compounds targeting autophagy that are in the preclinical stages of investigation. Furthermore, drug combinations based on autophagy modulation strategies in urological system cancers are systematically summarized and discussed. These findings provide comprehensive new insight for the future discovery of more autophagy-related drug candidates.",2024-10-18
39426685,Effects of phospholipase D1-inhibitory peptide on the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells.,"Phospholipase D1 (PLD1) contributes to cancer development and progression through its effects on cell proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Its central role in these processes makes it a promising target for novel cancer treatments aimed at inhibiting its activity and disrupting the signaling pathways it regulates. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of PLD1 inhibition on gastric cancer cell growth using a novel peptide inhibitor, TAT-TVTSP. PLD1, which plays a role in cancer progression, catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylcholine into choline and phosphatidic acid through hydrolysis. To effectively target PLD1 in cells, we engineered TAT-TVTSP by fusing a PLD1-inhibitory peptide (TVTSP) with a cell-penetrating peptide (TAT). We observed that TAT-TVTSP effectively inhibited PLD1 activity in AGS gastric cancer cells. Moreover, TAT-TVTSP significantly inhibited the mammalian target of the rapamycin signaling pathway, including the phosphorylation of key downstream targets such as S6K1, AKT, S473, glycogen synthase kinase-3b, and forkhead box O1. TAT-TVTSP did not induce cell death, but it triggered cell cycle arrest by activating p21 and p27 via AKT phosphorylation. Functional assays revealed that TAT-TVTSP significantly impaired the colony-forming ability of AGS cells, thus inhibiting cell proliferation. Transwell and wound-healing assays revealed that this peptide disrupted the cellular behaviors critical to cancer progression, such as migration and invasion. In vivo, TAT-TVTSP significantly reduced tumor growth in the xenograft model of gastric cancer without any toxicity. Overall, our results suggest that TAT-TVTSP is a novel therapeutic agent for PLD1-mediated cancers.",2024-10-18
39424745,Design and investigation of novel iridoid-based peptide conjugates for targeting EGFR and its mutants L858R and T790M/L858R/C797S: an in silico study.,"In this work, we designed novel peptide conjugates with plant-based iridoid and lichen-derived depside derivatives to target the wild-type EGFR (WT) and its mutants, L858R and T790M/L858R/C797S triple mutant. These mutations are often expressed in multiple cancers, particularly lung cancer. Specifically, the iridoids included 7-deoxyloganetic acid (7-DGA) and loganic acid (LG), while the depside derivative was sekikaic acid (SK). These compounds are known for their innate anticancer properties and were conjugated with two separate peptide sequences KLPGWSG (K) and YSIPKSS (Y). These sequences have been shown to target EGFR in previous phage display library screening, although the mechanism is unknown. Thus, we created the di-conjugates for dual targeting and investigated their interactions of the di-conjugates and that of the neat peptides with the kinase domain of EGFR (WT) and the two mutants using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MM-GBSA analysis. Docking studies revealed that the (7-DGA)<sub>2</sub>-K showed the highest binding affinity at - 9.3 kcal/mol with the L858R mutant, while (LG)<sub>2</sub>-Y displayed the highest binding affinity at - 9.0 kcal/mol for the triple mutant receptor. Our results indicated that several of the conjugates interacted with crucial residues of the kinase domain, including ASP855 and THR854 (activation loop), MET793 and PRO794 (hinge region), ARG841 (catalytic loop), and LYS728 and LEU718 of the glycine-rich P-loop. Interestingly, strong hydrophobic interactions were also observed with the C-terminal tail residues, such as PHE997 and ALA1000 as well as with ARG999 for the YSIPKSS peptide and most of the conjugates. The hydroxyl group of the cyclopentane ring and the oxygen of the pyran ring of the (7-DGA)<sub>2</sub>-peptide conjugates contributed to binding particularly in the hinge region, while the peptide components formed an extended structure that bound well into the C-lobe. The (SK)<sub>2</sub>-Y di-conjugate and KLPGWSG peptide formed hydrogen bonds with the SER797 residue of the triple mutant. Overall, our results show that the (7-DGA)<sub>2</sub>-K, di-conjugate, the (7-DGA)<sub>2</sub>-Y di-conjugate, and the neat YSIPKSS demonstrated strong and stable binding with the L858R mutant and the highly resistant triple mutant EGFR, respectively. The novel designed conjugates demonstrate potential for further optimization for laboratory studies aimed at developing new therapeutics for targeting specific EGFR mutant expressing cells.",2024-10-19
39414203,Towards novel small-molecule inhibitors blocking PD-1/PD-L1 pathway: From explainable machine learning models to molecular dynamics simulation.,"Molecular design of small-molecule inhibitors targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathway has been recognized as an active research area by the clinical success of cancer immunotherapy. In recent years, using machine learning (ML) methods to accelerate drug design have been confirmed. However, the black box character of ML methods makes model interpretation and ligands optimization obscured. Herein, five explainable ML models were constructed by integrating five ML models with the SHAP method, where these ML models were pretrained with >4000 molecules and their R<sup>2</sup> ranged from 0.835 to 0.86 on test set. Subsequently, the explainable ML models were employed to identify the relationship between fragments and bio-activity of a small molecule inhibitor BMS-1166, leading to the modification of BMS-1166 into 60 novel compounds. After consensus docking and ADMET test, 3 small molecules (C27, C52 and C54) with better docking scores and lower toxicity than BMS-1166 were screened out further. Finally, the improved binding affinity of C27, C52 to the PD-L1 dimer was validated by the MD simulation. Overall, this work proposed an efficient protocol on the basis of explainable ML models for designing small-molecule inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in a rational way.",2024-10-15

39403745,Homologous Peptide Foldamer Promotes FUS Aggregation and Triggers Cancer Cell Death.,"Fused in sarcoma (FUS), a multifunctional deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA)-binding protein, has been implicated in various cancer types, including sarcoma and leukemia. Despite its association with these diseases, there has been limited exploration of FUS as a cancer therapy target, primarily because its dynamic nature makes it difficult to target specifically. In this study, we explored a kind of β-sheet peptide foldamer, named β<sub>4</sub>-TAT, to influence FUS aggregation by targeting its RNA recognition motifs (RRM). This approach leverages the noncovalent interaction characteristics of peptide self-assembly processes. The β<sub>4</sub> sequence, derived from the FUS RRM β-sheet, in combination with TAT, a peptide known for its nuclear targeting capability, enables β<sub>4</sub>-TAT to bind specifically to the analogous β<sub>4</sub> sequence within FUS. Notably, β<sub>4</sub>-TAT effectively induces FUS aggregation within cells, leading to the death of cancer cells. Our work developed a novel peptide foldamer-based strategy for inducing protein aggregation, paving the way for innovative therapeutic approaches in targeting FUS-associated cancers.",2024-10-15
39399312,Developing peptide-based fusion inhibitors as an antiviral strategy utilizing coronin 1 as a template.,"Enveloped viruses enter the host cells by endocytosis and subsequently fuse with the endosomal membranes, or fuse with the plasma membrane at the cell surface. The crucial stage of viral infection, regardless of the route taken to enter the host cell, is membrane fusion. The present work aims to develop a peptide-based fusion inhibitor that prevents membrane fusion by modifying the properties of the participating membranes, without targeting a protein. This would allow us to develop a fusion inhibitor that might work against a larger spectrum of enveloped viruses as it does not target any specific viral fusion protein. With this goal in mind, we have designed a novel peptide by modifying a native sequence derived from coronin 1, a phagosomal protein, that helps to avoid lysosomal degradation of mycobacterium-loaded phagosomes. The designed peptide, mTG-23, inhibits ∼30-40% fusion between small unilamellar vesicles containing varying amounts of cholesterol by modulating the biophysical properties of the participating bilayers. As a proof of principle, we have further demonstrated that the mTG-23 inhibits Influenza A virus infection in A549 and MDCK cells (with ∼EC<sub>50</sub> of 20.45 μM and 21.55 μM, respectively), where viral envelope and endosomal membrane fusion is a crucial step. Through a gamut of biophysical and biochemical methods, we surmise that mTG-23 inhibits viral infection by inhibiting viral envelope and endosomal membrane fusion. We envisage that the proposed antiviral strategy can be extended to other viruses that employ a similar modus operandi, providing a novel pan-antiviral approach.",2024-10-02

39394468,Targeting USP11 regulation by a novel lithium-organic coordination compound improves neuropathologies and cognitive functions in Alzheimer transgenic mice.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, severely impairs patients' cognitive functions. Although its exact etiology remains unclear, the abnormal aggregations of misfolded β-amyloid peptide and tau protein are considered pivotal in its pathological progression. Recent studies identify ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) as the key regulator of tau deubiquitination, exacerbating tau aggregation and AD pathology. Thereby, inhibiting USP11 function, via either blocking USP11 activity or lowering USP11 protein level, may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy against AD. Our research introduces IsoLiPro, a unique lithium isobutyrate-L-proline coordination compound, effectively lowers USP11 protein level and enhances tau ubiquitination in vitro. Additionally, long-term oral administration of IsoLiPro dramatically reduces total and phosphorylated tau levels in AD transgenic mice. Moreover, IsoLiPro also significantly lessens β-amyloid deposition and synaptic damage, improving cognitive functions in these animal models. These results indicate that IsoLiPro, as a novel small-molecule USP11 inhibitor, can effectively alleviate AD-like pathologies and improve cognitive functions, offering promise as a potential multi-targeting therapeutic agent against AD.",2024-10-11
39387184,Molecular Mechanism-Driven Discovery of Novel Small Molecule Inhibitors against Drug-Resistant SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> Variants.,"Under the selective pressure of nirmatrelvir, a peptidomimetic covalent drug targeting SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, various drug-resistant mutations on M<sup>pro</sup> have been acquired <i>in vitro</i>. Among the mutations, L50F and E166V, along with the combination of L50F and E166V, are particularly representative and pose considerable obstacles to the effective treatment of COVID-19. Our previous study identified NMI-001 and NMI-002 as novel nonpeptide inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, possessing unique scaffolds and binding modes different from those of nirmatrelvir. In view of these findings, we proposed a drug design strategy aimed at rapidly identifying inhibitors that can combat mutation-induced drug resistance. Initially, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to investigate the binding mechanisms of NMI-001 and NMI-002 against the three drug-resistant mutants (M<sup>pro</sup>_L50F, M<sup>pro</sup>_E166V, and M<sup>pro</sup>_L50F+E166V). Then, we conducted two phases of high-throughput virtual screening. In the first phase, NMI-001 served as a template to perform scaffold hopping-based similarity search in a library of 15,742,661 compounds. In the second phase, 968 compounds exhibiting similarity to NMI-001 were evaluated via molecular docking and MD simulations. Six compounds that may be effective against at least one mutant were identified, and five compounds were procured for conducting <i>in vitro</i> assays. Finally, the compound Z1557501297 (NMI-003) exhibiting inhibitory effects against the E166V (IC<sub>50</sub> = 27.81 ± 2.65 μM) and L50F+E166V (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.78 ± 0.74 μM) mutants was discovered. The binding modes referring to NMI-003-M<sup>pro</sup>_E166V and NMI-003-M<sup>pro</sup>_L50F+E166V were further elucidated at the atomic level. In summary, NMI-003 reported herein is the first compound with activity against E166V and L50F+E166V, which provides a good starting point to design novel antiviral drugs for the treatment of drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2.",2024-10-10
39384750,CircMETTL3-156aa reshapes the glycolytic metabolism of macrophages to promote M1 polarization and induce cytokine storms in sHLH.,"Persistent macrophage activation and cytokine storms are critical causes for the rapid disease progression and high mortality rate of Secondary Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Identification of key regulatory factors that govern the activation of macrophages is vital. Plasma exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) are considered important biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for various diseases, however, their function in sHLH is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that circMETTL3, derived from METTL3, is upregulated in sHLH patient plasma exosomes, which may plays an important role in the diagnosis of sHLH. Significantly, we also revealed that a novel peptide encoded by circMETTL3, METTL3-156aa, is an inducer of M1 macrophage polarization, which is responsible for the development of cytokine storms during sHLH. We then identified that METTL3-156aa binding with lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and promotes M1 macrophage polarization by enhancing macrophage glycolysis. Additionally, the glycolysis metabolite lactate upregulates the cleavage factor SRSF10 expression by lactylation. This results in increased splicing of the pre-METTL3 mRNA, leading to an enchance in the production of cirMETTL3. Therefore, our results suggest that the circMETTL3/METTL3-156aa/LDHA/Lactate/SRSF10 axis forms a positive feedback loop and may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of sHLH.",2024-10-09
39377976,Segment-Based Peptide Design Reveals the Importance of N-Terminal High Cationicity for Antimicrobial Activity Against Gram-Negative Pathogens.,"Host defense antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are recognized candidates to develop a new generation of peptide antibiotics. While high hydrophobicity can be deployed in peptides for eliminating Gram-positive bacteria, high cationicity is usually observed in AMPs against Gram-negative pathogen. This study investigates how the sequence distribution of basic amino acids affects peptide activity. For this purpose, we utilized human cathelicidin LL-37 as a template and designed four highly selective ultrashort peptides with similar length, net charge, and hydrophobic content. LL-10 + , RK-9 + , KR-8 + , and RIK-10 + showed similar activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in vitro and comparable antibiofilm efficacy in a murine wound model. However, these peptides showed clear activity differences against Gram-negative pathogens with RIK-10 + (i.e., LL-37mini2) being the strongest and LL-10 + the weakest. To understand this activity difference, we characterized peptide toxicity; the effects of salts, pH, and serum on peptide activity; and the mechanism of action and determined the membrane-bound helical structure for RIK-10 + by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. By writing an R program, we generated charge density plots for these peptides and uncovered the importance of the N-terminal high-density basic charges for antimicrobial potency. To validate this finding, we reversed the sequences of two peptides. Interestingly, sequence reversal weakened the activity of RIK-10 + but increased the activity of LL-10 + especially against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Those more active peptides with high cationicity at the N-terminus are also more hydrophobic based on HPLC retention times. A database search found numerous natural sequences that arrange basic amino acids primarily at the N-terminus. Combined, this study not only obtained novel peptide leads but also discovered one useful strategy for designing novel antimicrobials to control drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.",2024-10-08
39373641,Activation of polycystin-1 signaling by binding of stalk-derived peptide agonists.,"Polycystin-1 (PC1) is the protein product of the <i>PKD1</i> gene whose mutation causes autosomal dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). PC1 is an atypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with an autocatalytic GAIN domain that cleaves PC1 into extracellular N-terminal and membrane-embedded C-terminal (CTF) fragments. Recently, activation of PC1 CTF signaling was shown to be regulated by a stalk tethered agonist (TA), resembling the mechanism observed for adhesion GPCRs. Here, synthetic peptides of the first 9- (p9), 17- (p17), and 21-residues (p21) of the PC1 stalk TA were shown to re-activate signaling by a stalkless CTF mutant in human cell culture assays. Novel Peptide Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (Pep-GaMD) simulations elucidated binding conformations of p9, p17, and p21 and revealed multiple specific binding regions to the stalkless CTF. Peptide agonists binding to the TOP domain of PC1 induced close TOP-putative pore loop interactions, a characteristic feature of stalk TA-mediated PC1 CTF activation. Additional sequence coevolution analyses showed the peptide binding regions were consistent with covarying residue pairs identified between the TOP domain and the stalk TA. These insights into the structural dynamic mechanism of PC1 activation by TA peptide agonists provide an in-depth understanding that will facilitate the development of therapeutics targeting PC1 for ADPKD treatment.",2024-10-07
39360630,A novel peptide-based tau aggregation inhibitor as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.,"As aggregation underpins Tau toxicity, aggregation inhibitor peptides may have disease-modifying potential. They are therefore currently being designed and target either the <sup>306</sup>VQIVYK<sup>311</sup> aggregation-promoting hotspot found in all Tau isoforms or the <sup>275</sup>VQIINK<sup>280</sup> aggregation-promoting hotspot found in 4R isoforms. However, for any Tau aggregation inhibitor to potentially be clinically relevant for other tauopathies, it should target both hotspots to suppress aggregation of Tau isoforms, be stable, cross the blood-brain barrier, and rescue aggregation-dependent Tau phenotypes in vivo.",2024-10-03
39357665,"Structure and functional studies of Avt1, a novel peptide from the sea anemone Aulactinia veratra.","Sea anemones are a rich source of peptide toxins spanning a diverse range of biological activities, typically targeting proteins such as ion channels, receptors and transporters. These peptide toxins and their analogues are usually highly stable and selective for their molecular targets, rendering them of interest as molecular tools, insecticides and therapeutics. Recent transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the sea anemone Aulactinia veratra identified a novel 28-residue peptide, designated Avt1. Avt1 was produced using solid-phase peptide synthesis, followed by oxidative folding and purification of the folded peptide using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry profile of synthetic Avt1 showed a pure peak with molecular mass 6 Da less than that of the reduced form of the peptide, indicating the successful formation of three disulfide bonds. The solution structure determined by NMR revealed that Avt1 adopts an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold, in which a ring is formed by two disulfide bonds with a third disulfide penetrating the ring to create the pseudo-knot. This structure provides ICK peptides with high structural, thermal and proteolytic stability. Consistent with its ICK structure, Avt1 was resistant to proteolysis by trypsin, chymotrypsin and pepsin, although it was not a trypsin inhibitor. Avt1 at 100 nM showed no activity in patch-clamp electrophysiological assays against several mammalian voltage-gated ion channels, but has structural features similar to toxins targeting insect sodium ion channels. Although sequence homologues of Avt1 are found in a number of sea anemones, this is the first representative of this family to be characterised structurally and functionally.",2024-09-30

Evidence suggests that positive allosteric modulators (PAM) and other enhancers of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) signaling could have therapeutic utility as smoking cessation agents.,2024-09-05
39334900,The Endocannabinoid Peptide RVD-Hemopressin Is a TRPV1 Channel Blocker.,"Neurotransmission is critical for brain function, allowing neurons to communicate through neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. RVD-hemopressin (RVD-Hp), a novel peptide identified in noradrenergic neurons, modulates cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Unlike hemopressin (Hp), which induces anxiogenic behaviors via transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) activation, RVD-Hp counteracts these effects, suggesting that it may block TRPV1. This study investigates RVD-Hp's role as a TRPV1 channel blocker using HEK293 cells expressing TRPV1-GFP. Calcium imaging and patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that RVD-Hp reduces TRPV1-mediated calcium influx and TRPV1 ion currents. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations indicated that RVD-Hp interacts with TRPV1's selectivity filter, forming stable hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, thus preventing ion permeation. These findings highlight RVD-Hp's potential as a therapeutic agent for conditions involving TRPV1 activation, such as pain and anxiety.",2024-09-08
39320984,The Development and Application of KinomePro-DL: A Deep Learning Based Online Small Molecule Kinome Selectivity Profiling Prediction Platform.,"Characterizing the kinome selectivity profiles of kinase inhibitors is essential in the early stages of novel small-molecule drug discovery. This characterization is critical for interpreting potential adverse events caused by off-target polypharmacology effects and provides unique pharmacological insights for drug repurposing development of existing kinase inhibitor drugs. However, experimental profiling of whole kinome selectivity is still time-consuming and resource-demanding. Here, we report a deep learning classification model using an in-house built data set of inhibitors against 191 well-representative kinases constructed based on a novel strategy by systematically cleaning and integrating six public data sets. This model, a multitask deep neural network, predicts the kinome selectivity profiles of compounds with novel structures. The model demonstrates excellent predictive performance, with auROC, prc-AUC, Accuracy, and Binary_cross_entropy of 0.95, 0.92, 0.90, and 0.37, respectively. It also performs well in a priori testing for inhibitors targeting different categories of proteins from internal compound collections, significantly improving over similar models on data sets from practical application scenarios. Integrated to subsequent machine learning-enhanced virtual screening workflow, novel CDK2 kinase inhibitors with potent kinase inhibitory activity and excellent kinome selectivity profiles are successfully identified. Additionally, we developed a free online web server, KinomePro-DL, to predict the kinome selectivity profiles and kinome-wide polypharmacology effects of small molecules (available on kinomepro-dl.pharmablock.com). Uniquely, our model allows users to quickly fine-tune it with their own training data sets, enhancing both prediction accuracy and robustness.",2024-09-25
39309487,Identification of novel small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 by chemical genetics.,"There are only eight approved small molecule antiviral drugs for treating COVID-19. Among them, four are nucleotide analogues (remdesivir, JT001, molnupiravir, and azvudine), while the other four are protease inhibitors (nirmatrelvir, ensitrelvir, leritrelvir, and simnotrelvir-ritonavir). Antiviral resistance, unfavourable drug‒drug interaction, and toxicity have been reported in previous studies. Thus there is a dearth of new treatment options for SARS-CoV-2. In this work, a three-tier cell-based screening was employed to identify novel compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. One compound, designated <b>172</b>, demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple human pathogenic coronaviruses and different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Mechanistic studies validated by reverse genetics showed that compound <b>172</b> inhibits the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) by binding to an allosteric site and reduces 3CLpro dimerization. A drug synergistic checkerboard assay demonstrated that compound <b>172</b> can achieve drug synergy with nirmatrelvir <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vivo</i> studies confirmed the antiviral activity of compound <b>172</b> in both Golden Syrian Hamsters and K18 humanized ACE2 mice. Overall, this study identified an alternative druggable site on the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, proposed a potential combination therapy with nirmatrelvir to reduce the risk of antiviral resistance and shed light on the development of allosteric protease inhibitors for treating a range of coronavirus diseases.",2024-05-31

39297466,Exploring the Potential of Herbal Compounds as Autophagy Modulators in Alzheimer's Disease: A Comprehensive Review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes atrophy of brain cells, leading to their death, and has become a leading cause of death in aging populations worldwide. AD is characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and tau phosphorylation in neural tissues, but the precise pathophysiology of the disease is still obscure. Autophagy is an evolutionarily targeted mechanism that is necessary for the elimination of neuronal and glial misfolded proteins as well as proteins. It also plays an essential role in synaptic plasticity. The aberrant autophagy primarily influences the process of aging and neurodegeneration. Autophagy significantly influences how Aβ and tau function physiologically, therefore, atypical autophagy is expected to perform an important role in Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation characteristic in the development of AD. Bioactive phytoconstituents could majorly contribute as a natural yet effective alternative approach to slow down the progression of neurodegeneration and promote the active aging process in elderly patients. Over the recent years, it is well evidenced that different secondary metabolites including polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, and phenols exhibited neuroprotective effects, and attenuated brain damage, and cognitive impairment in vitro as well as in vivo. Additionally, the underlying mechanism of action shared by them is the regulation of competent autophagy via the removal of aggregated protein and mitochondrial dysfunction. The present article is structured as a reference for researchers keen to investigate and assess the new natural compound-mediated therapeutic approach for AD treatment through the modulation of autophagy.",2024-09-18
39300122,"Pyroptosis in health and disease: mechanisms, regulation and clinical perspective.","Pyroptosis is a type of programmed cell death characterized by cell swelling and osmotic lysis, resulting in cytomembrane rupture and release of immunostimulatory components, which play a role in several pathological processes. Significant cellular responses to various stimuli involve the formation of inflammasomes, maturation of inflammatory caspases, and caspase-mediated cleavage of gasdermin. The function of pyroptosis in disease is complex but not a simple angelic or demonic role. While inflammatory diseases such as sepsis are associated with uncontrollable pyroptosis, the potent immune response induced by pyroptosis can be exploited as a therapeutic target for anti-tumor therapy. Thus, a comprehensive review of the role of pyroptosis in disease is crucial for further research and clinical translation from bench to bedside. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in understanding the role of pyroptosis in disease, covering the related development history, molecular mechanisms including canonical, non-canonical, caspase 3/8, and granzyme-mediated pathways, and its regulatory function in health and multiple diseases. Moreover, this review also provides updates on promising therapeutic strategies by applying novel small molecule inhibitors and traditional medicines to regulate pyroptosis. The present dilemmas and future directions in the landscape of pyroptosis are also discussed from a clinical perspective, providing clues for scientists to develop novel drugs targeting pyroptosis.",2024-09-20

Despite the termination of clinical trials for GSK3α/β inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, there is a pressing need for novel therapeutic strategies targeting GSK3α/β. Here, we identified the compound AS1842856 (AS), a specific forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) inhibitor, reduced intracellular GSK3α/β content in a FOXO1-independent manner. Specifically, AS directly bound to GSK3α/β, promoting its translocation to the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and accelerating exocytosis, ultimately decreasing intracellular GSK3α/β content. Expectedly, AS treatment effectively suppressed Tau hyperphosphorylation in cells exposed to okadaic acid or expressing the Tau<sup>P301S</sup> mutant. Furthermore, AS was visualized to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using an imaging mass microscope. Long-term treatment of AS enhanced cognitive function in P301S transgenic mice by mitigating Tau hyperphosphorylation through downregulation of GSK3α/β expression in the brain. Altogether, AS represents a novel small-molecule GSK3α/β inhibitor that facilitates GSK3α/β exocytosis, holding promise as a therapeutic agent for GSK3α/β hyperactivation-associated disorders.",2024-09-17

No selective inhibitors for this protein have been developed for cancer treatment. Therefore, the current study describes developing and characterizing a novel small molecule ZYZ384 screened and synthesized based on SMYD3 structure. Virtual screening was initially used to identify a lead compound and followed up by modification to get the novel molecules. Several technologies were used to facilitate compound screening about these novel molecules' binding affinities and inhibition activities with SMYD3 protein; the antitumor activity has been assessed in vitro using various cancer cell lines. In addition, a tumor-bearing nude mice model was established, and the activity of the selected molecule was determined in vivo. Both RNA-seq and chip-seq were performed to explore the antitumor mechanism. This work identified a novel small molecule ZYZ384 targeting SMYD3 with antitumor activity and impaired hepatocellular carcinoma tumor growth by reducing H3K4 trimethylation of the Rac1 promoter triggering the tumor cell cycle arrest through the AKT pathway.",2024-09-15

39281284,Multiple site inflammation and acute kidney injury in crush syndrome.,"Crush syndrome, which frequently occurs in earthquake disasters, often leads to rhabdomyolysis induced acute kidney injury (RIAKI). Recent findings indicate that systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) exacerbates muscle collapse, contributing to RIAKI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the involvement of multiple site inflammation, including intraperitoneal, in crush syndrome. In a mouse model of RIAKI, elevated levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNFα, IL-6, myoglobin, and dsDNA were observed in serum and the peritoneal cavity, peaking earlier in the intraperitoneal cavity than in serum or urine. Our previously developed novel peptide inhibiting leukocyte extracellular traps was administered intraperitoneally and blocked all of these mediators in the intraperitoneal cavity and serum, ameliorating muscle damage and consequent RIAKI. Although further studies are needed to determine whether intraperitoneal inflammation associated with muscle collapse can lead to systemic inflammation, resulting in more severe and prolonged muscle damage and renal injury, early suppression of multiple site inflammation, including intraperitoneal, might be an effective therapeutic target.",2024-08-30
39273340,Drug Repurposing Approach to Identify Candidate Drug Molecules for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver cancer, with a high mortality rate due to the limited therapeutic options. Systemic drug treatments improve the patient's life expectancy by only a few months. Furthermore, the development of novel small molecule chemotherapeutics is time-consuming and costly. Drug repurposing has been a successful strategy for identifying and utilizing new therapeutic options for diseases with limited treatment options. This study aims to identify candidate drug molecules for HCC treatment through repurposing existing compounds, leveraging the machine learning tool MDeePred. The Open Targets Platform, UniProt, ChEMBL, and Expasy databases were used to create a dataset for drug target interaction (DTI) predictions by MDeePred. Enrichment analyses of DTIs were conducted, leading to the selection of 6 out of 380 DTIs identified by MDeePred for further analyses. The physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, water solubility, drug-likeness, and medicinal chemistry properties of the candidate compounds and approved drugs for advanced stage HCC (lenvatinib, regorafenib, and sorafenib) were analyzed in detail. Drug candidates exhibited drug-like properties and demonstrated significant target docking properties. Our findings indicated the binding efficacy of the selected drug compounds to their designated targets associated with HCC.

39266056,Target-Specific <i>De Novo</i> Peptide Binder Design with DiffPepBuilder.,"Despite the exciting progress in target-specific <i>de novo</i> protein binder design, peptide binder design remains challenging due to the flexibility of peptide structures and the scarcity of protein-peptide complex structure data. In this study, we curated a large synthetic data set, referred to as PepPC-F, from the abundant protein-protein interface data and developed DiffPepBuilder, a <i>de novo</i> target-specific peptide binder generation method that utilizes an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model trained on PepPC-F to codesign peptide sequences and structures. DiffPepBuilder also introduces disulfide bonds to stabilize the generated peptide structures. We tested DiffPepBuilder on 30 experimentally verified strong peptide binders with available protein-peptide complex structures. DiffPepBuilder was able to effectively recall the native structures and sequences of the peptide ligands and to generate novel peptide binders with improved binding free energy. We subsequently conducted <i>de novo</i> generation case studies on three targets. In both the regeneration test and case studies, DiffPepBuilder outperformed AfDesign and RFdiffusion coupled with ProteinMPNN, in terms of sequence and structure recall, interface quality, and structural diversity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the introduction of disulfide bonds enhanced the structural rigidity and binding performance of the generated peptides. As a general peptide binder <i>de novo</i> design tool, DiffPepBuilder can be used to design peptide binders for given protein targets with three-dimensional and binding site information.",2024-09-12
39258600,"The effect of Biokos™, a natural lipopeptide surfactant extracted from the bacterium Pseudomonas, on Epistylis infections in Carassius auratus.","In the aquaculture industry, biocides are routinely used to treat parasitosis in fish, and researchers are continually developing sustainable alternatives that can replace these harsh chemicals. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new natural compound, BiokosTM, for the treatment against Epistylis sp. in Carassius auratus fish. The infestation was identified by the presence of whitish plaques on the integument of five animals, and the diagnosis was confirmed through skin scrapings. BiokosTM is a lipopeptide derived from the bacteria Pseudomonas that can destroy the functionality of the cell membrane of ciliated protozoa. The action of BiokosTM does not harm animals and the environment because the compound degrades into amino acids and fatty acids within days. A 0.15 m3 (150 L) aquarium was treated with an Ich-AwayTM water conditioner manufactured by the Danish company Sundew ApS, which has BiokosTM as the active ingredient. Six tablets were added to the water daily for two days, and new skin scrapings were performed. The fish were clinically well and no longer possessed lesions or parasites. The results obtained indicate that BiokosTM can be an innovative and more sustainable alternative for controlling epistyliasis in ornamental fish.",2024-09-06
39244973,Discovery of novel 20S proteasome subunit β5 PROTAC degraders as potential therapeutics for pharyngeal carcinoma and Bortezomib-resistant multiple myeloma.,"Resistance to proteasome inhibitors like Bortezomib is a major challenge in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), an emerging therapeutic approach that induces selective degradation of target proteins, offer a promising solution to overcome drug resistance. In this study, we designed and synthesized novel small-molecule PROTACs that induce 20S proteasome subunit β5 degradation as a strategy to overcome Bortezomib resistance. These 20S proteasome subunit β5 PROTACs demonstrated considerable binding affinity to 20S proteasome subunit β5 and cereblon (CRBN), effectively induced 20S proteasome subunit β5 degradation, and exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against a panel of cancer cell lines. Notably, PROTACs 12f and 14 displayed robust antitumor effects against both the pharyngeal carcinoma cell line FaDu and the Bortezomib-resistant MM cell line KM3/BTZ in vitro and in vivo with excellent safety profiles. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of PROTACs 12f and 14 as novel 20S proteasome subunit β5-degrading agents for the treatment of pharyngeal carcinoma and overcoming Bortezomib resistance in MM.",2024-09-03
39243947,The role of glutathione peroxidase 4 in neuronal ferroptosis and its therapeutic potential in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.,"Ferroptosis is a type of cell death that depends on iron and is driven by lipid peroxidation, playing a crucial role in neuronal death during stroke. A central element in this process is the inactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), an antioxidant enzyme that helps maintain redox balance by reducing lipid hydroperoxides. This review examines the critical function of GPx4 in controlling neuronal ferroptosis following ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. We explore the mechanisms through which GPx4 becomes inactivated in various stroke subtypes. In strokes, excess glutamate depletes glutathione (GSH) and products of hemoglobin breakdown overwhelm GPx4. Studies using genetic models with GPx4 deficiency underscore its vital role in maintaining neuronal survival and function. We also consider new therapeutic approaches to enhance GPx4 activity, including novel small molecule activators, adjustments in GSH metabolism, and selenium supplementation. Additionally, we outline the potential benefits of combining these GPx4-focused strategies with other anti-ferroptotic methods like iron chelation and lipoxygenase inhibition for enhanced neuroprotection. Furthermore, we highlight the significance of understanding the timing of GPx4 inactivation during stroke progression to design effective therapeutic interventions.",2024-09-06
39226290,Plasma membrane damage limits cytoplasmic delivery by conventional cell penetrating peptides.,"Intracellular delivery of large molecule cargo via cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) is an inefficient process and despite intense efforts in past decades, improvements in efficiency have been marginal. Utilizing a standardized and comparative analysis of the delivery efficiency of previously described cationic, anionic, and amphiphilic CPPs, we demonstrate that the delivery ceiling is accompanied by irreparable plasma membrane damage that is part of the uptake mechanism. As a consequence, intracellular delivery correlates with cell toxicity and is more efficient for smaller peptides than for large molecule cargo. The delivery of pharmaceutically relevant cargo quantities with acceptable toxicity thus seems hard to achieve with the CPPs tested in our study. Our results suggest that any engineered intracellular delivery system based on conventional cationic or amphiphilic CPPs, or the design principles underlying them, needs to accept low delivery yields due to toxicity limiting efficient cytoplasmic uptake. Novel peptide designs based on detailed study of uptake mechanisms are required to overcome these limitations.",2024-09-03
39220500,Positive-Charge-Based Small Molecule Dyes for Gut Microbiota Fluorescent Imaging.,"As one of the research hotspots in recent years, gut microbiota have been proven to be closely related to host metabolism, nutrient absorption, and immune regulation. However, there are still many urgent issues in the research of gut microbiota, such as the localization and tracking of gut microbiota. In this research, two new fluorescent probes, EF and 6F, were developed by optimizing the structure of the positron salt small molecule probe F16. <i>In vitro</i> labeling experiments showed that EF and 6F can quickly label Gram-positive bacteria, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, as well as Gram-negative bacteria, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella pullorum</i>. Meanwhile, EF and 6F have little bacterial toxicity and are used at a maximum concentration of 200 μM. Compared with EF, 6F has better hydrophilicity and stronger fluorescence characteristics in aqueous solutions, making it more suitable for imaging within gut microbiota populations. The results of <i>in vivo</i> imaging experiments indicate that EF and 6F can label and image the intestinal microbiota colonized by the mouse intestinal mucosal epithelium without causing any damage to intestinal tissue. Compared with commercially available MitoTracker dyes and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) dyes, EF and 6F exhibit better biocompatibility. Therefore, the compounds EF and 6F synthesized in this study are novel small molecule probes suitable for imaging gut microbiota, providing a better probe selection for exploring complex gut microbiota.",2024-08-19
39207455,Identification of Small-Molecule Antagonists Targeting the Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone Receptor (GHRHR).,"The growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) belongs to Class B1 of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Class B1 GPCR peptides such, as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), have been proposed to bind in a two-step model, where first the C-terminal region of the peptide interacts with the extracellular domain of the receptor and, subsequently, the N-terminus interacts with the seven transmembrane domain of the receptor, resulting in activation. The GHRHR has recently been highlighted as a promising drug target toward several types of cancer and has been shown to be overexpressed in prostate, breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer. Indeed, peptide GHRHR antagonists have displayed promising results in many cancer models. However, no nonpeptide GHRHR-targeting compounds have yet been identified. We have utilized several computational tools to target GHRHR and identify potential small-molecule compounds directed at this receptor. These compounds were validated <i>in vitro</i> using a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) ELISA to measure activity at the GHRHR. <i>In vitro</i> results suggest that several of the novel small-molecule compounds could inhibit GHRH-induced cAMP accumulation. Preliminary analysis of the specificity/selectivity of one of the most effective hit compounds indicated that the effect seen was via inhibition of the GHRHR. We therefore report the first nonpeptide antagonists of GHRHR and propose a structural basis for inhibition induced by the compounds, which may assist in the future design of lead GHRHR compounds for treating disorders attributed to dysregulated/aberrant GHRHR signaling.",2024-08-29
39196099,Current and future strategies for targeting the endothelin pathway in cardiovascular disease.,"The first endothelin (ET)-1 receptor antagonist was approved for clinical use over 20 years ago, but to date this class of compounds has been limited to treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare disease. Translational research over the last 5 years has reignited interest in the ET system as a therapeutic target across the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases including resistant hypertension, microvascular angina and post-coronavirus disease 2019 conditions. Notable developments include approval of a new ET<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist and, intriguingly, combining the actions of ET<sub>A</sub> and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist within the same novel small molecule. Combinations of ET receptor blockers with other drugs, including phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 antagonists, may drive synergistic benefits with the prospect of alleviating side effects. These new therapeutic strategies have the potential to dramatically widen the scope of indications targeting the ET-1 pathway.",2023-11-02
39194017,Identification and Characterization of Novel Small-Molecule Enhancers of the CUL3<sup>LZTR1</sup> E3 Ligase KRAS Complex.,"The RAS family of GTPases is among the most frequently mutated proteins in human cancer, creating a high clinical demand for therapies that counteract their signaling activity. An important layer of regulation that could be therapeutically exploited is the proteostatic regulation of the main RAS GTPases KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS, as well as the closely related members, MRAS and RIT1, by the leucine zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1 cullin 3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CUL3<sup>LZTR1</sup>). Genetic inactivation of <i>LZTR1</i>, as observed in different cancer entities and Noonan syndrome leads to enhanced RAS GTPase abundance and altered MAPK pathway activation state. Novel therapeutic approaches to interfere with hyperactive RAS signaling, thereby complementing existing treatments, are highly sought after. Motivated by the growing arsenal of molecular glue degraders, we report the identification of novel chemical fragments that enhance the protein-protein interaction (PPI) of the KRAS-LZTR1 complex. We established a split-luciferase-based reporter assay that monitors the RAS GTPase-LZTR1 interaction in a scalable format, capable of capturing chemical, as well as mutational perturbations. Using this screening system, in combination with a small fragment library, we identified two fragments, C53 and Z86, that enhance the interaction of the KRAS-LZTR1 complex in a dose-dependent manner. Further orthogonal validation experiments using proximity biotinylation (BioID), thermal shift assays, and NMR spectroscopy demonstrated fragment-dependent enhanced recruitment of endogenous LZTR1 and physical engagement of KRAS. The two fragments, which potentiate the KRAS-LZTR1 interaction, serve as starting points for fragment-based drug discovery. Additionally, the assay we introduced is amenable to high-throughput screening to further explore the pharmacological modulation of the CUL3<sup>LZTR1</sup>-RAS GTPase complex.",2024-08-28
39182547,"Comprehensive characterization of a novel small-molecule activator for the nuclear receptor Nur77: Chemical, molecular, and biological insights.","The nuclear receptor Nur77 is a transcription factor belonging to the NR4A subfamily. Upon activation, it regulates a wide array of biological and pathophysiological processes by modulating the expression of its target genes. Previous findings have classified Nur77 as an orphan receptor because of the discovery of a structurally atypical ligand-binding domain and the lack of identification of an endogenous ligand. Nevertheless, recent studies have uncovered several endogenous, natural, and small synthetic molecules that can bind to and activate Nur77. However, developing selective and potent Nur77 activators remains a significant challenge. The discovery of novel and potential small synthetic molecules that modulate Nur77 activity will facilitate therapeutic interventions of Nur77 against several human diseases. In this study, we have reported the development of a novel and effective Nur77 ligand. Our data show that (1E,4E)-1,5-di(pyrazin-2-yl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one (PB) induces Nur77 transcriptional activity by interacting with a putative Nur77 ligand binding site by forming solid hydrogen bonding. Calculated chemical parameters denote that PB has sophisticated chemical features that will enhance its interaction with the Nur77 ligand-binding domain. Molecular docking simulations showed that PB fits in the Nur77 putative ligand binding site with solid hydrogen bonding, and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that PB binding would stabilize the Nur77 ligand binding domain. Further, in vitro studies revealed that PB increases Nur77 nuclear expression and activity, inhibits cigarette smoke-induced inflammatory phenotype of airway epithelial cells, and protects against apoptosis. These findings provide insights into developing an effective Nur77 small-molecule activator which could be developed into a therapeutic agent against inflammatory diseases.",2024-08-24
39182546,The novel peptide PEP-Z-2 potentially treats renal fibrosis in vivo and in vitro by regulating TGF-β/Smad/AKT/MAPK signaling.,"Renal fibrosis is a process in which excessive deposition of extracellular matrix leads to an increase in tissue hardness and gradual destruction of the renal parenchyma. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) commonly progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), ultimately leading to renal failure. This disease has high incidence and mortality rates, but to date, effective treatment options are lacking. PEP-Z-2 is a collagen peptide isolated from redlip croaker scales and may have potential fibroprotective activity. In this study, PEP-Z-2 was found to alleviate unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)- and folic acid (FA)-induced kidney injury in a mouse model, reduce collagen deposition in tissues, normalize renal function, reduce the expression of fibrosis markers, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and restore the balance of the oxidant/antioxidant system. In vitro experiments also demonstrated that PEP-Z-2 inhibits the TGF-β-induced differentiation of fibroblasts and renal tubular epithelial cells into myofibroblasts and reduces the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin, Col I, and α-SMA, demonstrating notable therapeutic effects on renal fibrosis. This effect is achieved by regulating the TGF-β/Smad/AKT/MAPK pathway. Our research suggested that PEP-Z-2 is a potential therapeutic drug for renal fibrosis, and peptides from aquatic organisms may constitute a new class of candidate drugs for the treatment of renal fibrosis and even other types of organ fibrosis.",2024-08-27
39181117,Combining Mitomycin C with inhibition of BAD phosphorylation enhances apoptotic cell death in advanced cervical cancer.,"Mitomycin C (MMC), a DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic, is commonly used clinically for recurrent cervical carcinoma (CC), either alone or in combination. MMC generates DNA damage resulting in CC cell death yet also induces increased AKT-BAD phosphorylation associated with drug resistance and reduced clinical benefit. The present study evaluates the efficacy of combined MMC and a BAD phosphorylation inhibitor in CC.",2024-08-24
39178245,A NOVEL OPSONIC EXTRACELLULAR CIRP INHIBITOR MOP3 ALLEVIATES GUT ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION INJURY.,"Introduction: Gut ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury promotes the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP). Gut I/R often leads to acute lung injury (ALI), a major contributor to mortality. Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-factor VIII-derived oligopeptide-3 (MOP3) is a novel peptide that attenuates sepsis by opsonizing eCIRP and facilitating its phagocytic clearance. We hypothesized that MOP3 reduces inflammation, mitigates gut and lung injury, and improves survival in gut I/R injury. Methods: Phagocytosis of FITC-labeled eCIRP by intestinal epithelial cells was determined by confocal microscopy, and the cell supernatant was evaluated for cytokine expression by ELISA. Adult C57BL/6 mice underwent 60 min of gut ischemia via superior mesenteric artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Mice were treated with MOP3 or vehicle via retro-orbital injection at the time of reperfusion. At 4 h post-I/R, blood, gut, and lungs were harvested for further assay. In additional mice, 36-h survival was assessed. Plasma levels of injury and inflammatory markers were measured with colorimetry and ELISA, respectively. Tissue mRNA expression was measured with qPCR. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), TUNEL, histologic injury, and ZO-1 immunohistochemistry assessments were performed. Results: MOP3 significantly increased eCIRP phagocytosis by intestinal epithelial cells ( P < 0.01) and decreased IL-6 release ( P < 0.001). Gut I/R caused elevated plasma eCIRP levels. MOP3 treatment significantly reduced plasma levels of IL-1β ( P < 0.01), IL-6 ( P < 0.05), and lactate dehydrogenase ( P < 0.05) along with a significant decrease in gut ( P < 0.05) and lung ( P < 0.001) injury scores as well as gut cell death ( P < 0.05). Moreover, MOP3 reduced pulmonary levels of chemokines and the granulocyte activation marker MPO after gut I/R. Mechanistically, ZO-1 expression in the gut was decreased following gut I/R injury, whereas MOP3 significantly reversed the decrease in ZO-1 mRNA expression ( P < 0.001). Finally, mice treated with MOP3 exhibited a significant decrease in mortality ( P < 0.05). Conclusions: Treatment with MOP3 effectively mitigates organ injury induced by gut I/R. This beneficial effect is attributed to the facilitation of eCIRP clearance, directing the potential of MOP3 as an innovative therapeutic approach for this critical and often fatal condition.",2024-08-21
39169825,N-Substituted Pyrrole-Based Heterocycles as Broad-Spectrum Filoviral Entry Inhibitors.,"Since the largest and most fatal Ebola virus epidemic during 2014-2016, there have been several consecutive filoviral outbreaks in recent years, including those in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Ongoing outbreak prevalence and limited FDA-approved filoviral therapeutics emphasize the need for novel small molecule treatments. Here, we showcase the structure-activity relationship development of N-substituted pyrrole-based heterocycles and their potent, submicromolar entry inhibition against diverse filoviruses in a target-based pseudovirus assay. Inhibitor antiviral activity was validated using replication-competent Ebola, Sudan, and Marburg viruses. Mutational analysis was used to map the targeted region within the Ebola virus glycoprotein. Antiviral counter-screen and phospholipidosis assays were performed to demonstrate the reduced off-target activity of these filoviral entry inhibitors. Favorable antiviral potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties of the N-substituted pyrrole-based heterocycles support their potential as broad-spectrum antifiloviral treatments.",2024-08-06
39167092,Development of a Novel Peptide-Based PET Tracer [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-BP1 for BCMA Detection in Multiple Myeloma.,"B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has emerged as a promising tumor marker for the diagnosis and treatment of multiple myeloma. The noninvasive and rapid detection of BCMA expression in vivo provides significant value in screening and evaluating multiple myeloma patients receiving BCMA-targeted therapy. We identified the BCMA-targeting peptide BP1 from a one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) peptide library using a high-throughput microarray strategy. The BCMA-targeting specificity and affinity of BP1 were assessed by surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi), flow cytometry, and confocal imaging. BCMA-positive (H929) and BCMA-negative (K562) subcutaneous tumor models were established and labeled with <sup>68</sup>Ga for BP1, followed by PET imaging and biodistribution studies. PET imaging demonstrated that <sup>68</sup>Ga-labeled BP1 has significant specific uptake in multiple myeloma, enabling rapid identification of BCMA expression and precise delineation of the disease. Thus, BP1 represents an ideal candidate for multiple myeloma imaging.",2024-08-21
39152155,Identification of novel small molecule-based strategies of COL7A1 upregulation and readthrough activity for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.,"Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a rare genetic disease caused by loss of function mutations in the gene coding for collagen VII (C7) due to deficient or absent C7 expression. This disrupts structural and functional skin architecture, leading to blistering, chronic wounds, inflammation, important systemic symptoms affecting the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, cornea, and kidney function, and an increased skin cancer risk. RDEB patients have an extremely poor quality of life and often die at an early age. A frequent class of mutations in RDEB is premature termination codons (PTC), which appear in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity with other mutations. RDEB has no cure and current therapies are mostly palliative. Using patient-derived keratinocytes and a library of 8273 small molecules and 20,160 microbial extracts evaluated in a phenotypic screening interrogating C7 levels, we identified three active chemical series. Two of these series had PTC readthrough activity, and one upregulated C7 mRNA, showing synergistic activity when combined with the reference readthrough molecule gentamicin. These compounds represent novel potential small molecule-based systemic strategies that could complement topical-based treatments for RDEB.",2024-08-16
39145746,Heteroaryl Group Containing Trisubstituted Alkenes: Synthesis and Anti-Tumor Activity.,"Pancreatobililary cancers are fatal solid tumors that pose a significant threat to human life. It is imperative to investigate novel small molecule active compounds for controlling these cancers. Heterocyclic compounds (e. g. gemcitabine) and multi-substituted alkenes (e. g. resveratrol) are commonly applied in tumor treatment. Researchers have proposed that the synthesis of new trisubstituted alkenes containing heteroaromatic rings by combining these two scaffolds may be a fresh strategy to develop new active molecules. In this study, we utilized alkenyl bromide and heteroaryl boronic acid as substrates, employing Suzuki coupling to generate a series of triarylethylenes featuring nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms. Through in vitro experiments, the results indicated that some compounds exhibited remarkable anti-tumor efficacy (e. g. IC50<sub>[3be, GBC-SD]</sub>=0.13 μM and IC50<sub>[3be, PANC-1]</sub>=0.27 μM). The results further demonstrated that the antitumor efficacy of these compounds was dependent on the heteroatom, π-system, skeleton-bonding site, and substituent type.",2024-10-18
39143566,"Does rAj-Tspin, a novel peptide from A. japonicus, exert antihepatocellular carcinoma effects via the ITGB1/ZYX/FAK/AKT signaling pathway?","rAj-Tspin, a soluble recombinant peptide from Apostichopus japonicus, can inhibit the integrin β1 (ITGB1)/FAK/AKT signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis. Zyxin (ZYX) is a focal adhesion protein that is considered a novel mediator of EMT and apoptosis. However, the inhibitory mechanisms of rAj-Tspin in HCC and whether it is related to ZYX are unclear. We examined the antitumor effect of rAj-Tspin on the Huh7 human HCC cell line and on a nude mouse model generated via subcutaneous injection or orthotopic intrahepatic transplantation of Huh7 cells. Our results revealed that rAj-Tspin strikingly reduced the viability and promoted the apoptosis of Huh7 cells and inhibited HCC tumor growth in nude mice. rAj-Tspin inhibited ITGB1 and ZYX protein expression in vivo and in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, the FAK/AKT signaling pathway and the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells were suppressed upon ITGB1 and ZYX knockdown. Moreover, the effect of ITGB1 overexpression on the growth of HCC cells was inhibited by rAj-Tspin. In contrast, the promoting effect of ITGB1 overexpression could be inhibited by ZYX knockdown. ZYX knockdown had no effect on ITGB1 expression. These findings suggest that ZYX is required for the indispensable role of ITGB1 in rAj-Tspin-alleviated HCC and provide an important therapeutic target for HCC. In summary, the anti-HCC effect of rAj-Tspin potentially involves the regulation of the ITGB1/ZYX/FAK/AKT pathway, which in turn impacts EMT and apoptosis.",2024-08-14
39142180,"Malic enzymes in cancer: Regulatory mechanisms, functions, and therapeutic implications.","Malic enzymes (MEs) are metabolic enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of malate to pyruvate and NAD(P)H. While researchers have well established the physiological metabolic roles of MEs in organisms, recent research has revealed a link between MEs and carcinogenesis. This review collates evidence of the molecular mechanisms by which MEs promote cancer occurrence, including transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation, post-translational protein modifications, and protein-protein interactions. Additionally, we highlight the roles of MEs in reprogramming energy metabolism, suppressing senescence, and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment. We also discuss the involvement of these enzymes in mediating tumor resistance and how the development of novel small-molecule inhibitors targeting MEs might be a good therapeutic approach. Insights through this review are expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between MEs and cancer, while facilitating future research on the potential therapeutic applications of targeting MEs in cancer management.",2024-07-19
39138279,Peptidomic analysis reveals novel peptide PDLC promotes cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma via Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still presents poor prognosis with low overall survival rates and limited therapeutic options available. Recently, attention has been drawn to peptidomic analysis, an emerging field of proteomics for the exploration of new potential peptide drugs for the treatment of various diseases. However, research on the potential function of HCC peptides is lacking. Here, we analyzed the peptide spectrum in HCC tissues using peptidomic techniques and explored the potentially beneficial peptides involved in HCC. Changes in peptide profiles in HCC were examined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Analyze the physicochemical properties and function of differently expressed peptides using bioinformatics. The effect of candidate functional peptides on HCC cell growth and migration was evaluated using the CCK-8, colony formation, and transwell assays. Transcriptome sequencing analysis and western blot were employed to delve into the mode of action of potential peptide on HCC. Peptidomic analysis of HCC tissue yielded a total of 8683 peptides, of which 452 exhibited up-regulation and 362 showed down-regulation. The peptides that were differentially expressed, according to bioinformatic analysis, were closely linked to carbon metabolism and the mitochondrial inner membrane. The peptide functional validation identified a novel peptide, PDLC (peptide derived from liver cancer), which was found to dramatically boost HCC cell proliferation through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. Our research defined the peptide's properties and pattern of expression in HCC and identified a novel peptide, PDLC, with a function in encouraging HCC progression, offering an entirely new potential therapeutic target the disease.",2024-08-13
39138237,"Discovery and engineering of a novel peptide, Temporin-WY2, with enhanced in vitro and in vivo efficacy against multi-drug resistant bacteria.","Infections by drug-resistant microorganisms are a threat to global health and antimicrobial peptides are considered to be a new hope for their treatment. Temporin-WY2 was identified from the cutaneous secretion of the Ranidae frog, Amolops wuyiensis. It presented with a potent anti-Gram-positive bacterial efficacy, but its activity against Gram-negative bacteria and cancer cell lines was unremarkable. Also, it produced a relatively high lytic effect on horse erythrocytes. For further improvement of its functions, a perfect amphipathic analogue, QUB-1426, and two lysine-clustered analogues, 6K-WY2 and 6K-1426, were synthesised and investigated. The modified peptides were found to be between 8- and 64-fold more potent against Gram-negative bacteria than the original peptide. Additionally, the 6K analogues showed a rapid killing rate. Also, their antiproliferation activities were more than 100-fold more potent than the parent peptide. All of the peptides that were examined demonstrated considerable biofilm inhibition activity. Moreover, QUB-1426, 6K-WY2 and 6K-1426, demonstrated in vivo antimicrobial activity against MRSA and E. coli in an insect larvae model. Despite observing a slight increase in the hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity of the modified peptides, they still demonstrated a improved therapeutic index. Overall, QUB-1426, 6K-WY2 and 6K-1426, with dual antimicrobial and anticancer functions, are proposed as putative drug candidates for the future.",2024-08-13
39132158,METTL3 Inhibition Suppresses Cell Growth and Survival in Colorectal Cancer via ASNS Downregulation.,"<b>Background:</b> Colorectal cancer (CRC) presents a significant global health burden, with high rates of incidence and mortality, and an urgent need to improve prognosis. STM2457, a novel small molecule inhibitor specific for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) catalytic enzyme Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) has implicated significant treatment potentials in a few of types of cancer. However, its impact and underlying mechanism are still unclear in CRC cells. <b>Methods:</b> We used CCK-8 and colony formation assay to observe cell growth, flow cytometry and TUNEL approaches to detect cell apoptosis under the treatment of STM2457 on CRC cells <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i>. RNA-sequencing, qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to explore downstream effectors of STM2457. Messenger RNA stability was evaluated by qRT-PCR after treatment with actinomycin D. The methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) qPCR, dual-luciferase reporter analyses and m6A dot blotting were carried out to measure the m6A modification. Associated gene expression pattern and clinical relevance in CRC clinical tissue samples were analyzed using online database. <b>Results:</b> STM2457 exhibited a strong influence on cell growth suppression and apoptosis of CRC cells <i>in vitro</i> and subcutaneous xenograft growth <i>in vivo</i>. Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) was markedly downregulated upon STM2457 treatment or METTL3 knockdown and exogenous overexpression of ASNS could rescue the biological defects induced by STM2457. Mechanistically, the downregulation of ASNS by STM2457 may be due to the decrease of m6A modification level in ASNS mRNA mediated by METTL3. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings suggest that STM2457 may serve as a potential therapeutic agent and ASNS may be a new promising therapeutic target for CRC.",2024-07-16
39126612,"A randomized phase 1 study of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MK-1088, a novel dual adenosine receptor antagonist, in healthy adult participants.","This phase 1 first-in-human study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MK-1088, a novel, small-molecule dual inhibitor of adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> and A<sub>2B</sub> receptors. Healthy adult participants were enrolled in two panels (n = 8 each) and randomly assigned to receive MK-1088 (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) orally in each of five treatment periods. Participants in panel A received single ascending doses of MK-1088 at 1, 10, 50, and 150 mg or placebo in a fasted or fed (50 mg only) state. Participants in panel B received MK-1088 at 3, 25, 100, and 224 mg or placebo in a fasted state. Primary objectives were to evaluate safety, tolerability, and plasma pharmacokinetics following a single dose of MK-1088. The secondary objective was to evaluate the effects of a high-fat meal on pharmacokinetics. All participants (n = 16) completed the study (median age: 33 years [range: 20-43]; all were male). Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 1 of 6 (17%), 4 of 6 (67%), 4 of 6 (67%), and 2 of 6 (33%) participants after receiving MK-1088 at 3, 25, 100, and 224 mg, respectively. No serious AEs or deaths due to any cause occurred. MK-1088 was rapidly absorbed after a single dose; half-life was ~ 11 h in the 100-224 mg dose range. The target concentration at 12 h (> 0.3 µM) was exceeded at the 50-mg dose level. MK-1088 plasma pharmacokinetics increased dose proportionately. A high-fat meal did not significantly affect pharmacokinetics at the 50-mg dose. MK-1088 was well tolerated and demonstrated dose-proportional pharmacokinetic properties that were not affected by a high-fat meal.",2024-08-10

39116711,Synthesis and biological studies of 2-aminothiophene derivatives as positive allosteric modulators of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor.,"As a step toward the development of novel small-molecule positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart diseases, we discovered a novel 2-amino-thiophene (2-AT) based lead compound bearing an ethyl 3-carboxylate appendage. In this work, we report the syntheses and biological studies of more than forty 2-AT analogs, that have revealed a 2-aminothiophene-3-arylketone analogue 7 (MW 299) showing approximately a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion at 5 μM when combined with the GLP-1 peptide at 10 nM. In vivo studies using CD1 mice at a dose of 10 mg/kg, clearly demonstrated that the blood plasma glucose level was lowered by 50% after 60 min. Co-treatment of 7 with sitagliptin, an inhibitor of GLP-1 degrading enzyme Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV, further confirmed 7 to be an effective PAM of GLP-1R. The small molecular weight and demonstrated allosteric modulating properties of these compound series, show the potential of these scaffolds for future drug development.",2024-08-02

39106256,A High-Throughput Screening Platform Identifies FDA-Approved Drugs That Inhibit SREBP Pathway Activation.,"Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors are central regulators of lipid homeostasis and are essential for lipid metabolic reprogramming that supports tumor growth in multiple cancers. SREBP pathway inhibitors have been identified, but bioavailable compounds are lacking. To address this need, we designed a novel approach for screening a collection of 4,474 FDA-approved drugs. SREBPs are conditionally essential and required under low lipid conditions. Leveraging this property, we screened for drugs that inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth in lipid-poor, but not lipid-rich, medium. The primary screen identified 83 drugs that inhibited cell growth in a lipid-dependent manner. Secondary assays examining SREBP target gene expression, SREBP proteolytic cleavage, and effects on human breast cancer cells identified 13 FDA-approved drugs that inhibit SREBP pathway activation. Taken together, we demonstrated that our screening approach can identify SREBP inhibitors from a small library of compounds. This high-throughput screening platform enables screening of large compound collections to discover novel small molecule SREBP inhibitors.",2024-08-06
39094541,Identification of a novel xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor for hyperuricemia treatment with high efficacy and safety profile.,"Hyperuricemia is with growing incidence and of high risk to develop into gout and other metabolic diseases. The key enzyme catalyzing uric acid synthesis, xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is a vital target for anti-hyperuricemic drugs, while XOR inhibitors characterized as both potent and safe are currently in urgent need. In this study, a novel small molecule compound, CC15009, was identified as a specific XOR inhibitor. CC15009 exerted strongest in vitro XOR inhibitory activity among current XOR inhibitors. It also showed favorable dose-dependent uric acid-lowering effects in two different XOR substrate-induced hyperuricemic mouse models, which was significantly superior than the current first-line drug, allopurinol. Mechanically, the direct binding of CC15009 against XOR was confirmed by molecular docking and SPR analysis. The inhibition mode was competitive and reversible. Besides, the potential antioxidant activity of CC15009 was indicated by its strong inhibitory activity against the oxidized isoform of XOR, which reduced ROS generation as the byproduct. Regarding the safety concerns of current XOR inhibitors, especially in cardiovascular risks, the safety of CC15009 was comprehensively evaluated. No significant abnormality was observed in the acute, subacute toxicity tests and mini-AMES test. Notably, there was no obvious inhibition of CC15009 against cardiac ion channels, including hERG, Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 at the concentration of 30 μM, indicating its lower cardiovascular risk. Taken together, our results supported CC15009 as a candidate of high efficacy and safety profile to treat hyperuricemia through direct XOR inhibition.",2024-08-01
39083045,Mechanisms of a novel regulatory light chain-dependent cardiac myosin inhibitor.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disease of the heart characterized by thickening of the left ventricle (LV), hypercontractility, and impaired relaxation. HCM is caused primarily by heritable mutations in sarcomeric proteins, such as β myosin heavy chain. Until recently, medications in clinical use for HCM did not directly target the underlying contractile changes in the sarcomere. Here, we investigate a novel small molecule, RLC-1, identified in a bovine cardiac myofibril high-throughput screen. RLC-1 is highly dependent on the presence of a regulatory light chain to bind to cardiac myosin and modulate its ATPase activity. In demembranated rat LV trabeculae, RLC-1 decreased maximal Ca2+-activated force and Ca2+ sensitivity of force, while it increased the submaximal rate constant for tension redevelopment. In myofibrils isolated from rat LV, both maximal and submaximal Ca2+-activated force are reduced by nearly 50%. Additionally, the fast and slow phases of relaxation were approximately twice as fast as DMSO controls, and the duration of the slow phase was shorter. Structurally, x-ray diffraction studies showed that RLC-1 moved myosin heads away from the thick filament backbone and decreased the order of myosin heads, which is different from other myosin inhibitors. In intact trabeculae and isolated cardiomyocytes, RLC-1 treatment resulted in decreased peak twitch magnitude and faster activation and relaxation kinetics. In conclusion, RLC-1 accelerated kinetics and decreased force production in the demembranated tissue, intact tissue, and intact whole cells, resulting in a smaller cardiac twitch, which could improve the underlying contractile changes associated with HCM.",2024-07-31

39067438,A peptide-salinomycin conjugate with a bystander effect reduces the stemness characteristics of ovarian cancer cells and enhances drug sensitivity.,"Salinomycin (Sal) has attracted considerable attention in the field of tumor treatment, especially for its inhibitory effect on cancer stem cells (CSCs) and drug-resistant tumor cells. However, its solubility and targeting specificity pose significant challenges to its pharmaceutical development. Sal-A6, a novel peptide-drug conjugate (PDC), was formed by linking the peptide A6 targeting the CSC marker CD44 with Sal using a specific linker. This conjugation markedly enhances the physicochemical properties of Sal and compared to Sal, Sal-A6 demonstrated a significantly increased activity against ovarian cancer. Furthermore, Sal-A6, employing a disulfide bond as a linker, exhibited bystander killing effect. Moreover, it induces substantial cytotoxic effect on both cancer stem cells and drug-resistant cells in addition to enhance chemosensitivity of resistant ovarian cancer cells. In summary, the results indicated that Sal-A6, a novel PDC derived from Sal, has potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of ovarian cancer and drug-resistant patients. Additionally, this discovery offers insights for developing PDC-type drugs using Sal as a foundation.",2024-07-20
39065742,A Dynamic and Effective Peptide-Based Strategy for Promptly Addressing Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern.,"Genomic surveillance based on sequencing the entire genetic code of SARS-CoV-2 involves monitoring and studying genetic changes and variations in disease-causing organisms such as viruses and bacteria. By tracing the virus, it is possible to prevent epidemic spread in the community, ensuring a 'precision public health' strategy. A peptide-based design was applied to provide an efficacious strategy that is able to counteract any emerging viral variant of concern dynamically and promptly to affect the outcomes of a pandemic at an early stage while waiting for the production of the anti-variant-specific vaccine, which require longer times. The inhibition of the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and one of the cellular receptors (DPP4) that its receptors routinely bind to infect human cells is an intriguing therapeutic approach to prevent the virus from entering human cells. Among the other modalities developed for this purpose, peptides surely offer unique advantages, including ease of synthesis, serum stability, low immunogenicity and toxicity, and small production and distribution chain costs. Here, we obtained a potent new inhibitor based on the rearrangement of a previously identified peptide that has been rationally designed on a cell dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequence, a ubiquitous membrane protein known to bind the RBD-SPIKE domain of the virus. This novel peptide (named <i>DPP4-derived</i>), conceived as an endogenous ""drug"", is capable of targeting the latest tested variants with a high affinity, reducing the VSV* DG-Fluc pseudovirus Omicron's infection capacity by up to 14%, as revealed by in vitro testing in human Calu-3 cells. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) confirmed the binding affinity of the new <i>DPP4-derived</i> peptide with Omicron variant RBD.",2024-07-04
39061918,Novel Inhibitor of Keap1-Nrf2 Protein-Protein Interaction Attenuates Osteoclastogenesis In Vitro and Prevents OVX-Induced Bone Loss In Vivo.,"Keap1 interacts with Nrf2 by assisting in its ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis. By preventing ROS accumulation during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, Nrf2 activation can prevent the differentiation of osteoclasts. Additionally, inhibiting the Keap1-Nrf2 PPI can be an effective strategy for triggering Nrf2 to regulate oxidative stress. Structure-based virtual screening was performed to discover a potentially novel Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitor wherein KCB-F06 was identified. The inhibitory effects of KCB-F06 on osteoclastogenesis were investigated in vitro through TRAP staining and bone resorption assays. An ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis mouse model was applied to evaluate KCB-F06's therapeutic effects in vivo. Lastly, the underlying mechanisms were explored using real-time PCR, Western blotting, and co-IP assays. KCB-F06 was discovered as a novel Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitor. As a result, the expression of antioxidants (HO-1 and NQO1) was suppressed, hence reducing ROS accumulation during osteoclastogenesis. Subsequently, this caused the inactivation of RANKL-induced IKB/NF-kB signaling. This eventually led to the downregulation of osteoclast-specific proteins including NFATc1, which is an essential transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. These results demonstrated that Nrf2 activation in osteoclasts is a valuable tool for osteoclastic bone loss management. In addition, KCB-F06 presents as an alternative candidate for treating osteoclast-related bone diseases and as a novel small molecule that can serve as a model for further Keap1-NRF2 PPI inhibitor development.",2024-07-15
39059347,Advances in small-molecule insulin secretagogues for diabetes treatment.,"Diabetes, a metabolic disease caused by abnormally high levels of blood glucose, has a high prevalence rate worldwide and causes a series of complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, end-stage renal disease, and retinopathy. Small-molecule compounds have been developed as drugs for the treatment of diabetes because of their oral advantages. Insulin secretagogues are a class of small-molecule drugs used to treat diabetes, and include sulfonylureas, non-sulfonylureas, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, and other novel small-molecule insulin secretagogues. However, many small-molecule compounds cause different side effects, posing huge challenges to drug monotherapy and drug selection.

39059074,Development and biological evaluation of <sup>68</sup>Ga-labeled peptides for potential application in HER2-positive colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most lethal and prevalent malignancies in the world. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC. In this study, we aimed to design, synthesize and label peptide-based positron emission tomography (PET) tracers targeting HER2-positive CRC, namely [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-ES-01 and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-ES-02. The results show that [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-ES-01 and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-ES-02 possessed hydrophilicity, rapid pharmacokinetic properties and excellent stabilities. [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-ES-02 demonstrated higher binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 24.29 ± 4.95 nM) toward the HER2 in CRC. In HER2-positive HT-29 CRC xenograft mouse model, PET study showed specific tumor uptake after injection of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-ES-02 (SUV<sub>15min max</sub> = 0.87 ± 0.03; SUV<sub>30min max</sub> = 0.64 ± 0.02). In biodistribution study, the T/M ratios of <sup>68</sup>Ga-ES-02 at 30 min after injection reached a maximum of 4.07 ± 0.34. In summary, we successfully synthesized and evaluated two novel peptide-based PET tracers. Our data demonstrate that [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-ES-01/02 is capable of HER2-positive colorectal cancer, with [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-ES-02 showing superior imaging effect, enhanced targeting, and increased specificity.",2024-07-15
39053726,An MDM2 degrader shows potent cytotoxicity to MDM2-overexpressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with minimal toxicity to normal cells/tissues.,"The MDM2 oncogene is amplified and/or overexpressed in various human cancers and elevated expression of MDM2 protein acts as a survival factor promoting cancer progression through both p53-dependent and -independent pathways. Here, we report a novel small-molecule chemical compound (MX69-102) that we identified to induce MDM2 protein degradation, resulting in reactivation of p53, inhibition of XIAP, and potent cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in MDM2-overexpressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in vitro and in vivo. We have previously identified a compound (MX69) that binds to the MDM2 C-terminal RING domain and induces MDM2 protein degradation. In the present study, we performed structural modifications of MX69 and selected analog MX69-102, showing increased MDM2-targeting activity. MX69-102 exhibited significantly enhanced inhibitory and apoptotic effects on a group of MDM2-overexpressing ALL cell lines in vitro with IC<sub>50</sub> values of about 0.2 μM, representing an approximately 38-fold increase in activity compared to MX69. MX69-102 also showed effective inhibition on xenografted human MDM2-overexpressing ALL in SCID mice. Importantly, MX69-102 had minimal or no inhibitory effect on normal human hematopoiesis in vitro and was very well tolerated in vivo in animal models. Based on the strong inhibitory and apoptotic activity against MDM2-overexpressing ALL, along with minimal or no toxicity to normal cells/tissues, MX69-102 is a candidate for further development as a novel MDM2-targeted therapeutic drug for refractory/MDM2-overexpressing ALL.",2024-07-23
39051113,Syngeneic mouse model of YES-driven metastatic and proliferative hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a disease of high unmet medical need that has become a global health problem. The development of targeted therapies for HCC has been hindered by the incomplete understanding of HCC pathogenesis and the limited number of relevant preclinical animal models. We recently unveiled a previously uncharacterized YES kinase (encoded by YES1)-dependent oncogenic signaling pathway in HCC. To model this subset of HCC, we established a series of syngeneic cell lines from liver tumors of transgenic mice expressing activated human YES. The resulting cell lines (referred to as HepYF) were enriched for expression of stem cell and progenitor markers, proliferated rapidly, and were characterized by high SRC family kinase (SFK) activity and activated mitogenic signaling pathways. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that HepYF cells are representative of the most aggressive proliferation class G3 subgroup of HCC. HepYF cells formed rapidly growing metastatic tumors upon orthotopic implantation into syngeneic hosts. Treatment with sorafenib or the SFK inhibitor dasatinib markedly inhibited the growth of HepYF tumors. The new HepYF HCC cell lines provide relevant preclinical models to study the pathogenesis of HCC and test novel small-molecule inhibitor and immunotherapy approaches.",2024-07-25
39048042,Novel peptide and hyaluronic acid coated biomimetic liposomes for targeting bacterial infections and sepsis.,"Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome resulting from an imbalanced immune response to severe infections. Despite advances in nanomedicines, effective treatments for sepsis are still lacking. Herein, vancomycin free base (VCM)-loaded dual functionalized biomimetic liposomes based on a novel TLR4-targeting peptide (P3) and hyaluronic acid (HA) (HA-P3-Lipo) were developed to enhance sepsis therapy. The nanocarrier revealed appropriate physicochemical parameters, good stability, and biocompatibility. The release of VCM from HA-P3-Lipo was found to be sustained with 76 % VCM released in 48 h. The biomimicry was elucidated by in silico tools and MST and results confirmed strong binding between the system and TLR4. Furthermore, HA-P3-Lipo revealed 2-fold enhanced antibacterial activity against S. aureus, sustained antibacterial activity against MRSA over 72 h and 5-fold better MRSA biofilm inhibition compared to bare VCM. Bacterial-killing kinetics and flow cytometry confirmed the superiority of HA-P3-Lipo in eliminating MRSA faster than VCM. The in vivo potential of the nanocarrier was elucidated in an MRSA-induced sepsis mice model, and the results confirmed the superiority of HA-P3-Lipo compared to free VCM in eliminating bacteria and down-regulating the proinflammatory markers. Therefore, HA-P3-Lipo exhibits potential as a promising novel multi-functional nanosystem against sepsis and could significantly contribute to the transformation of sepsis therapy.",2024-07-22
39047609,Hydrogen peroxide responsive theranostics for cancer-selective activation of DNA alkylators and real-time fluorescence monitoring in living cells.,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a notoriously difficult disease to treat, and many of the existing TNBC chemotherapeutics lack tumor selectivity and the capability for simultaneously visualizing and monitoring their own activity in the biological context. However, TNBC cells have been known to generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). To this end, three novel small molecule theranostics 1a, 1c, and 2 consisting of both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-responsive nitrogen mustard prodrug and profluorophore character have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated as targeted cancer therapeutics and bioimaging agents. The three theranostics comprise of boronate esters that deactivate nitrogen mustard functional groups and fluorophores but allow their selective activation through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific oxidative deboronation for the release of the active drug and fluorophore. The three theranostics demonstrated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-inducible DNA-alkylating capability and fluorescence turn-on properties in addition to selective anticancer activity. They are particularly effective in killing TNBC MDA-MB-468 cells with high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level while safe to normal epithelial MCF-10A cell. The conjugated boron-masked fluorophores in 1c and 2 are highly responsive towards H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which enabled tracking of the theranostics in living cellular mitochondria and nucleus organelles. The three theranostics 1a, 1c, and 2 are capable of both selective release of the active drug to take effect in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-rich cancer sites and simultaneously monitoring its activity. This single molecule system is of utmost importance to understand the function, efficacy, and mechanism of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-activated prodrugs and theranostics within the living recipient.",2024-07-20
39047413,9-O-monoethyl succinate berberine effectively blocks the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by targeting Wnt5a protein in inhibiting osteosarcoma growth.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy, mainly affecting children, adolescents, and young adults, followed by the elderly, with a high propensity for local invasion and metastasis. Although surgery combined with chemotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis of patients with OS, the prognosis for metastatic or recurrent OS is still unsatisfactory. The research community has struggled to develop an effective chemotherapy treatment regimen for this tumor. For the creation of an OS drug, our research team has effectively developed and manufactured a new drug named 9-O-monoethyl succinate berberine (B2).",2024-02-08
39047262,QPH-FR: A Novel Quinoa Peptide Enhances Chemosensitivity by Targeting Leucine-Rich Repeat-Containing G Protein-Coupled Receptor 5 in Colorectal Cancer.,"Chemoresistance is one of the difficulties in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), and the enhanced stemness of tumor cells is the underlying contributing factor. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) is a classical marker of CRC stem cells and can be an important potential target for CRC chemotherapy. Quinoa, a protein-rich plant, offers potential as a source of high-quality active peptides. Novelly, the study obtained quinoa protein hydrolysate (QPH) from whole quinoa grains by simulated digestion. <i>In vivo</i> experiments revealed that the tumor volume in the 5-FU+QPH group decreased from 145.90 ± 13.35 to 94.49 ± 13.05 mm<sup>3</sup> in the 5-FU group, suggesting that QPH enhances the chemosensitivity of CRC. Further, the most effective peptide QPH-FR from 631 peptides in QPH was screened by activity prediction, molecular docking, and experimental validation. Mechanistically, QPH-FR competitively suppressed the formation of the LGR5/RSPO1 complex by binding to LGR5, causing RNF43/ZNRF3 to ubiquitinate the FZD receptor, thereby suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and exerting stemness inhibition. In summary, the study proposes that a novel peptide QPH-FR from quinoa elucidates the mechanism by which QPH-FR targets LGR5 to enhance chemosensitivity, providing theoretical support for the development of chemotherapeutic adjuvant drugs based on plant peptides.",2024-07-24
39045029,Combining the constitutive TRAIL-secreting induced neural stem cell therapy with the novel anti-cancer drug TR-107 in glioblastoma.,"Tumor-homing neural stem cell (NSC) therapy is emerging as a promising treatment for aggressive cancers of the brain. Despite their success, developing tumor-homing NSC therapy therapies that maintain durable tumor suppression remains a challenge. Herein, we report a synergistic combination regimen where the novel small molecule TR-107 augments NSC-tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) therapy (hiNeuroS-TRAIL) in models of the incurable brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) <i>in vitro</i>. We report that the combination of hiNeuroS-TRAIL and TR-107 synergistically upregulated caspase markers and restored sensitivity to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by significantly downregulating inhibitory pathways associated with chemoresistance and radioresistance in the TRAIL-resistant LN229 cell line. This combination also showed robust tumor suppression and enhanced survival of mice bearing human xenografts of both solid and invasive GBMs. These findings elucidate a novel combination regimen and suggest that the combination of these clinically relevant agents may represent a new therapeutic option with increased efficacy for patients with GBM.",2024-06-15

39027232,Therapeutic strategies of targeting non-apoptotic regulated cell death (RCD) with small-molecule compounds in cancer.,"Regulated cell death (RCD) is a controlled form of cell death orchestrated by one or more cascading signaling pathways, making it amenable to pharmacological intervention. RCD subroutines can be categorized as apoptotic or non-apoptotic and play essential roles in maintaining homeostasis, facilitating development, and modulating immunity. Accumulating evidence has recently revealed that RCD evasion is frequently the primary cause of tumor survival. Several non-apoptotic RCD subroutines have garnered attention as promising cancer therapies due to their ability to induce tumor regression and prevent relapse, comparable to apoptosis. Moreover, they offer potential solutions for overcoming the acquired resistance of tumors toward apoptotic drugs. With an increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing these non-apoptotic RCD subroutines, a growing number of small-molecule compounds targeting single or multiple pathways have been discovered, providing novel strategies for current cancer therapy. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the current regulatory mechanisms of the emerging non-apoptotic RCD subroutines, mainly including autophagy-dependent cell death, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, disulfidptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, alkaliptosis, oxeiptosis, parthanatos, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-driven necrosis, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, and immunogenic cell death (ICD). Furthermore, we focused on discussing the pharmacological regulatory mechanisms of related small-molecule compounds. In brief, these insightful findings may provide valuable guidance for investigating individual or collaborative targeting approaches towards different RCD subroutines, ultimately driving the discovery of novel small-molecule compounds that target RCD and significantly enhance future cancer therapeutics.",2024-04-24
39015284,Fragment-Based Discovery of Novel MUS81 Inhibitors.,"MUS81 is a structure-selective endonuclease that cleaves various branched DNA structures arising from natural physiological processes such as homologous recombination and mitosis. Due to this, MUS81 is able to relieve replication stress, and its function has been reported to be critical to the survival of many cancers, particularly those with dysfunctional DNA-repair machinery. There is therefore interest in MUS81 as a cancer drug target, yet there are currently few small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme reported, and no liganded crystal structures are available to guide hit optimization. Here we report the fragment-based discovery of novel small molecule MUS81 inhibitors with sub-μM biochemical activity. These inhibitors were used to develop a novel crystal system, providing the first structural insight into the inhibition of MUS81 with small molecules.",2024-06-07
39015272,Design Principle of Heparanase Inhibitors: A Combined In Vitro and In Silico Study.,"Heparanase (HPSE) is an enzyme that cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) side chains from heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Overexpression of HPSE is associated with various types of cancer, inflammation, and immune disorders, making it a highly promising therapeutic target. Previously developed HPSE inhibitors that have advanced to clinical trials are polysaccharide-derived compounds or their mimetics; however, these molecules tend to suffer from poor bioavailability, side effects via targeting other saccharide binding proteins, and heterogeneity. Few small-molecule inhibitors have progressed to the preclinical or clinical stages, leaving a gap in HPSE drug discovery. In this study, a novel small molecule that can inhibit HPSE activity was discovered through high-throughput screening (HTS) using an ultrasensitive HPSE probe. Computational tools were employed to elucidate the mechanisms of inhibition. The essential structural features of the hit compound were summarized into a structure-activity relationship (SAR) theory, providing insights into the future design of HPSE small-molecule inhibitors.",2024-05-23
39010824,LOXL2 inhibition ameliorates pulmonary artery remodeling in pulmonary hypertension.,"Conduit pulmonary arterial stiffening and the resultant increase in pulmonary vascular impedance have emerged as an important underlying driver of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Given that matrix deposition is central to vascular remodeling, we evaluated the role of the collagen cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase like 2 (LOXL2) in this study. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) subjected to hypoxia showed increased LOXL2 secretion. LOXL2 activity and expression were markedly higher in primary PASMCs isolated from the pulmonary arteries of the rat Sugen 5416 + hypoxia (SuHx) model of severe pulmonary hypertension (PH). Similarly, LOXL2 protein and mRNA levels were increased in the pulmonary arteries (PA) and lungs of rats with PH (SuHx and monocrotaline (MCT) models). Pulmonary arteries (PAs) isolated from the rats with PH exhibited hypercontractility to phenylephrine and attenuated vasorelaxation elicited by acetylcholine, indicating severe endothelial dysfunction. Tensile testing revealed a significant increase in PA stiffness in PH. Treatment with PAT-1251, a novel small-molecule LOXL2 inhibitor, improved active and passive properties of the PA ex vivo. There was an improvement in right heart function as measured by right ventricular pressure volume loops in vivo with PAT-1251. Importantly, PAT-1251 treatment ameliorated PH, resulting in improved pulmonary artery pressures, right ventricular remodeling, and survival. Hypoxia-induced LOXL2 activation is a causal mechanism in pulmonary artery stiffening in PH and pulmonary artery mechanical and functional decline. LOXL2 inhibition with PAT-1251 could be a promising approach to improve pulmonary artery pressures, right ventricular elastance, cardiac relaxation, and survival in PAH.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Pulmonary arterial stiffening contributes to the progression of PAH and the deterioration of right heart function. This study shows that LOXL2 is upregulated in rat models of PH. LOXL2 inhibition halts pulmonary vascular remodeling and improves PA contractility, endothelial function, and PA pressure, resulting in prolonged survival. Thus, LOXL2 is an important mediator of PA remodeling and stiffening in PH and a promising target to improve PA pressures and survival in PH.",2024-07-16
38991128,Discovery of Novel Peptide Antagonists Targeting GPR55 for Liver Inflammation and Fibrosis.,"Liver fibrosis is a condition characterized by aberrant proliferation of connective tissue in the liver resulting from diverse etiological factors. G protein-coupled receptor GPR55 has recently been identified as a regulator of liver diseases. Herein, we report the discovery of a cyclic peptide P1-1 that antagonizes GPR55 and suppresses collagen secretion in hepatic stellate cells. The alanine scanning and docking study was carried out to predict the binding mode and allowed for further structural optimization of peptide antagonists for GPR55. The subsequent <i>in vivo</i> study demonstrated that P1-1 ameliorates CCl<sub>4</sub>-induce and MCD-diet-induce acute liver inflammation and fibrosis. Further study indicates that P1-1 reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, attenuates ER stress, and inhibits mitochondria-associated hepatocyte apoptosis. In this work, we provided the first successful example of antagonizing GPR55 for liver inflammation and fibrosis, which validates GPR55 as a promising target for the treatment of liver fibrosis and affords a high-potent GPR55 antagonist P1-1 as a potential therapeutic candidate.",2024-07-11

38968799,"Preclinical pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity of novel small-molecule GPR119 agonists to treat type-2 diabetes and obesity.","The escalating global prevalence of type-2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity necessitates the development of novel oral medications. Agonism at G-protein coupled receptor-119 (GPR119) has been recognized for modulation of metabolic homeostasis in T2D, obesity, and fatty liver disease. However, off-target effects have impeded the advancement of synthetic GPR119 agonist drug candidates. Non-systemic, gut-restricted GPR119 agonism is suggested as an alternative strategy that may locally stimulate intestinal enteroendocrine cells (EEC) for incretin secretion, without the need for systemic drug availability, consequently alleviating conventional class-related side effects. Herein, we report the preclinical acute safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of novel GPR119 agonist compounds ps297 and ps318 that potentially target gut EEC for incretin secretion. In a proof-of-efficacy study, both compounds demonstrated glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion capability during glucose and mixed-meal tolerance tests in healthy mice. Furthermore, co-administration of sitagliptin with investigational compounds in diabetic db/db mice resulted in synergism, with GLP-1 concentrations rising by three-fold. Both ps297 and ps318 exhibited low gut permeability assessed in the in-vitro Caco-2 cell model. A single oral dose PK study conducted on healthy mice demonstrated poor systemic bioavailability of both agents. PK measures (mean ± SD) for compound ps297 (C<sub>max</sub> 23 ± 19 ng/mL, T<sub>max</sub> range 0.5 - 1 h, AUC<sub>0-24 h</sub> 19.6 ± 21 h*ng/mL) and ps318 (C<sub>max</sub> 75 ± 22 ng/mL, T<sub>max</sub> range 0.25 - 0.5 h, AUC<sub>0-24 h</sub> 35 ± 23 h*ng/mL) suggest poor oral absorption. Additionally, examinations of drug excretion patterns in mice revealed that around 25 % (ps297) and 4 % (ps318) of the drugs were excreted through faeces as an unchanged form, while negligible drug concentrations (<0.005 %) were excreted in the urine. These acute PK/PD assessments suggest the gut is a primary site of action for both agents. Toxicity assessments conducted in the zebrafish and healthy mice models confirmed the safety and tolerability of both compounds. Future chronic in-vivo studies in relevant disease models will be essential to confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of these novel compounds.",2024-07-05
38967115,Discovery of Monovalent Direct Degraders of BRD4 that Act via the Recruitment of DCAF11.,"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) using the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is a rapidly growing drug discovery modality to eliminate pathogenic proteins. Strategies for TPD have focused on heterobifunctional degraders that often suffer from poor drug-like properties, and molecular glues that rely on serendipitous discovery. Monovalent ""direct"" degraders represent an alternative approach, in which small molecules bind to a target protein and induce degradation of that protein through the recruitment of an E3 ligase complex. Using an ultra-high throughput cell-based screening platform, degraders of the bromodomain extraterminal protein BRD4 were identified and optimized to yield a lead compound, PLX-3618. In this paper, we demonstrate that PLX-3618 elicited UPS-mediated selective degradation of BRD4, resulting in potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Characterization of the degradation mechanism identified DCAF11 as the E3 ligase required for PLX-3618-mediated degradation of BRD4. Protein-protein interaction studies verified a BRD4:PLX-3618:DCAF11 ternary complex, and mutational studies provided further insights into the DCAF11-mediated degradation mechanism. Collectively, these results demonstrate the discovery and characterization of a novel small molecule that selectively degrades BRD4 through the recruitment of the E3 substrate receptor, DCAF11, and promotes potent antitumor activity in vivo.",2024-07-05
38958553,UBX-390: A Novel Androgen Receptor Degrader for Therapeutic Intervention in Prostate Cancer.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is an attractive target for treating prostate cancer, considering its role in the development and progression of localized and metastatic prostate cancer. The high global mortality burden of prostate cancer, despite medical treatments such as androgen deprivation or AR antagonist therapy, highlights the need to explore alternative strategies. One strategy involves the use of heterobifunctional degraders, also known as proteolysis-targeting chimeras, which are novel small-molecule therapeutics that inhibit amplified or mutated targets. Here, the study reports a novel cereblon-based AR degrader, UBX-390, and demonstrates its superior activity over established AR degraders, such as ARV-110 or ARCC-4, in prostate cancer cells under short- and long-term treatment conditions. UBX-390 suppresses chromatin binding and gene expression of AR and demonstrates substantial efficacy in the degradation of AR mutants in patients with treatment-resistant prostate cancer. UBX-390 is presented as an optimized AR degrader with remarkable potential for treating castration-resistant prostate cancer.",2024-07-03
38949857,Regulation of post-translational modification of PD-L1 and associated opportunities for novel small-molecule therapeutics.,"PD-L1 is overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells and binds to PD-1, resulting in tumor immune escape. Therapeutic strategies to target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway involve blocking the binding. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have limited efficacy against tumors because PD-L1 is also present in the cytoplasm. PD-L1 of post-translational modifications (PTMs) have uncovered numerous mechanisms contributing to carcinogenesis and have identified potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, small molecule inhibitors can block crucial carcinogenic signaling pathways, making them a potential therapeutic option. To better develop small molecule inhibitors, we have summarized the PTMs of PD-L1. This review discusses the regulatory mechanisms of small molecule inhibitors in carcinogenesis and explore their potential applications, proposing a novel approach for tumor immunotherapy based on PD-L1 PTM.",2024-07-01
38937742,WZ-3146 acts as a novel small molecule inhibitor of KIF4A to inhibit glioma progression by inducing apoptosis.,"Glioma is considered the most common primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Although traditional treatments have not achieved satisfactory outcomes, recently, targeted therapies for glioma have shown promising efficacy. However, due to the single-target nature of targeted therapy, traditional targeted therapies are ineffective; thus, novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed.",2024-06-27
38934857,Survival and Neurologic Outcomes From Pharmacologic Peptide Administration During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation of Pulseless Electrical Activity.,"Outcomes from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following sudden cardiac arrest are suboptimal. Postresuscitation targeted temperature management has been shown to have benefit in subjects with sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, but there are few data for outcomes from sudden cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity. In addition, intra-CPR cooling is more effective than postresuscitation cooling. Physical cooling is associated with increased protein kinase B activity. Therefore, our group developed a novel peptide, TAT-PHLPP9c, which regulates protein kinase B. We hypothesized that when given during CPR, TAT-PHLPP9c would improve survival and neurologic outcomes following pulseless electrical activity arrest.",2024-06-27
38934618,Unsaturated fatty acid perturbation combats emerging triazole antifungal resistance in the human fungal pathogen <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>.,"Contemporary antifungal therapies utilized to treat filamentous fungal infections are inhibited by intrinsic and emerging drug resistance. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop novel antifungal compounds that are effective against drug-resistant filamentous fungi. Here, we utilized an <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> cell-based high-throughput screen to identify small molecules with antifungal activity that also potentiated triazole activity. The screen identified 16 hits with promising activity against <i>A. fumigatus</i>. A nonspirocyclic piperidine, herein named MBX-7591, exhibited synergy with triazole antifungal drugs and activity against pan-azole-resistant <i>A. fumigatus</i> isolates. MBX-7591 has additional potent activity against <i>Rhizopus</i> species and CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent activity against <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>. Chemical, genetic, and biochemical mode of action analyses revealed that MBX-7591 increases cell membrane saturation by decreasing oleic acid content. MBX-7591 has low toxicity <i>in vivo</i> and shows good efficacy in decreasing fungal burden in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Taken together, our results suggest MBX-7591 is a promising hit with a novel mode of action for further antifungal drug development to combat the rising incidence of triazole-resistant filamentous fungal infections.IMPORTANCEThe incidence of infections caused by fungi continues to increase with advances in medical therapies. Unfortunately, antifungal drug development has not kept pace with the incidence and importance of fungal infections, with only three major classes of antifungal drugs currently available for use in the clinic. Filamentous fungi, also called molds, are particularly recalcitrant to contemporary antifungal therapies. Here, a recently developed <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> cell reporter strain was utilized to conduct a high-throughput screen to identify small molecules with antifungal activity. An emphasis was placed on small molecules that potentiated the activity of contemporary triazole antifungals and led to the discovery of MBX-7591. MBX-7591 potentiates triazole activity against drug-resistant molds such as <i>A. fumigatus</i> and has activity against Mucorales fungi. MBX-7591's mode of action involves inhibiting the conversion of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids, thereby impacting fungal membrane integrity. MBX-7591 is a novel small molecule with antifungal activity poised for lead development.",2024-06-27
38931896,Comparative Study of the Potential Cell-Penetrating Peptide ∆M4 on Apoptosis Cell Signaling in A375 and A431 Cancer Cell Lines.,"In recent yearsjajajj, peptide-based therapeutics have attracted increasing interest as a potential approach to cancer treatment. Peptides are characterized by high specificity and low cytotoxicity, but they cannot be considered universal drugs for all types of cancer. Of the numerous anticancer-reported peptides, both natural and synthetic, only a few have reached clinical applications. However, in most cases, the mechanism behind the anticancer activity of the peptide is not fully understood. For this reason, in this work, we investigated the effect of the novel peptide ∆M4, which has documented anticancer activity, on two human skin cancer cell lines. A novel approach to studying the potential induction of apoptosis by anticancer peptides is the use of protein microarrays. The results of the apoptosis protein study demonstrated that both cell types, skin malignant melanoma (A375) and epidermoid carcinoma (A431), exhibited markers associated with apoptosis and cellular response to oxidative stress. Additionally, ∆M4 induced concentration- and time-dependent moderate ROS production, triggering a defensive response from the cells, which showed decreased activation of cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase. However, the studied cells exhibited a differential response in catalase activity, with A375 cells showing greater resistance to the peptide action, possibly mediated by the Nrf2 pathway. Nevertheless, both cell types showed moderate activity of caspases 3/7, suggesting that they may undergo partial apoptosis, although another pathway of programmed death cannot be excluded. Extended analysis of the mechanisms of action of anticancer peptides may help determine their effectiveness in overcoming chemoresistance in cancerous cells.",2024-06-07
38931437,"Chemical Behavior and Bioactive Properties of Spinorphin Conjugated to 5,5'-Dimethyl- and 5,5'-Diphenylhydantoin Analogs.","The discovery of new peptides and their derivatives is an outcome of ongoing efforts to identify a peptide with significant biological activity for effective usage as a possible therapeutic agent. Spinorphin peptides have been documented to exhibit numerous applications and features. In this study, biologically active peptide derivatives based on novel peptide analogues of spinorphin conjugated with 5,5'-dimethyl (Dm) and 5,5'-diphenyl (Ph) hydantoin derivatives have been successfully synthesized and characterized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectral methods such as UV-Vis, FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), CD (Circular Dichroism), and fluorimetry were used to characterize the microstructure of the resulting compounds. The results revealed changes in peptide morphology as a result of the restructuring of the aminoacidic sequences and aromatic bonds, which is related to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between tyrosyl groups and the hydantoin moiety. Electrochemical and fluorescence approaches were used to determine some physicochemical parameters related to the biological behavior of the compounds. The biological properties of the spinorphin derivatives were evaluated in vivo for anticonvulsant activity against the psychomotor seizures at different doses of the studied peptides. Both spinorphin analog peptides with Ph and Dm groups showed activity against all three phases of the seizure in the intravenous Pentylenetetrazole Seizure (ivPTZ) test. This suggests that hydantoin residues do not play a crucial role in the structure of spinorphin compounds and in determining the potency to raise the seizure threshold. On the other hand, analogs with a phenytoin residue are active against the drug-resistant epilepsy test (6-Hz test). In addition, bioactivity analyses revealed that the new peptide analogues have the potential to be used as antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds. These findings suggest promising avenues for further research that may lead to the development of alternative medicines or applications in various fields beyond epilepsy treatment.",2024-06-12
38931301,"Impacts of Central Administration of the Novel Peptide, LEAP-2, in Different Food Intake Models in Conscious Rats.","Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide-2 (LEAP-2) has mutual antagonism with ghrelin, which evokes food intake under a freely fed state. Nevertheless, the impact of LEAP-2 on ghrelin under time-restricted feeding (TRF), which has benefits in the context of metabolic disease, is still unknown. This study aims to explore the impact of central administration of LEAP-2 on the ingestion behavior of rats, which was evaluated using their cumulative food intake in the TRF state. Before intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of <i>O-n</i>-octanoylated ghrelin (0.1 nmol/rat), as a food-stimulatory model, the rats received various doses of LEAP-2 (0.3, 1, 3 nmol/rat, ICV). Cumulative food intake was recorded at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after ICV injection under 12 h freely fed and TRF states in a light phase. In 12 h freely fed and TRF states, central administration of ghrelin alone induced feeding behavior. Pre-treatment with LEAP-2 (1 and 3 nmol/rat, ICV) suppressed ghrelin-induced food intake in a dose-dependent manner in a 12 h freely fed state instead of a TRF state, which may have disturbed the balance of ghrelin and LEAP-2. This study provides neuroendocrine-based evidence that may explain why TRF sometimes fails in fighting obesity/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in clinics.",2024-06-19

38919263,Serum Spexin Level Is Negatively Associated With Peripheral Neuropathy and Sensory Pain in Type 2 Diabetes.,"<b>Background:</b> Spexin is a novel peptide hormone and has shown antinociceptive effects in experimental mice. This study is aimed at evaluating the association of serum spexin level with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and related pain in a Chinese population. <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled 167 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) including 56 patients without DPN (non-DPN), 67 painless DPN, and 44 painful DPN. Serum spexin was measured using ELISA. Logistic regression models were performed to analyze the independent effects of spexin on prevalence of DPN and painful DPN. In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice, mechanical pain threshold was measured using electronic von Frey aesthesiometer. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and further stimulated with lipopolysaccharide without or with spexin. The gene expression was assayed by qPCR. <b>Results:</b> Compared with non-DPN, serum spexin level decreased in painless DPN and further decreased in painful DPN. The odds of DPN was associated with low spexin level in T2DM, which was similar by age, sex, BMI, and diabetes duration, but attenuated in smokers. The odds of having pain was associated with decreased spexin level in DPN, which was similar by age, sex, smoking status, and diabetes duration, but attenuated in normal weight. Furthermore, we observed that mechanical pain threshold increased in spexin-treated diabetic mice. We also found that lipopolysaccharide treatment increased the mRNA level of TNF-<i>α</i>, IL-6, and MCP-1 in human PBMCs, while spexin treatment prevented this increase. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results suggested that spexin might serve as a protective factor for diabetes against neuropathology and pain-related pathogenesis.",2024-05-23
38908201,"TMVP1448, a novel peptide improves detection of primary tumors and metastases by specifically targeting VEGFR-3.","Lymphangiogenesis at primary tumor and draining lymph nodes plays a pivotal role in tumor metastasis, which has been demonstrated to be regulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) pathway. However, the effect of molecular imaging peptides, which specifically bind VEGFR-3, in tracing tumors remains unclear. We prepared a novel peptide, TMVP1448, with high-affinity to VEGFR-3. The dissociation constant (KD) of TMVP1448 with VEGFR-3 was 7.07 ×10-7 M. In vitro cellular assay showed that TMVP1448 could bind specifically with VEGFR-3. Near infrared imaging results showed that Cy7-TMVP1448 was able to accurately trace primary and metastatic cancers, and PET/CT results showed that [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TMVP1448 was superior to commonly used radiotracers <sup>18</sup>F-FDG. Additionally, no significant negative effect of TMVP1448 was found in mice.

38906029,"The Notch inhibitor, FLI-06, increases the chemosensitivity of head and neck Squamous cell carcinoma cells to taxanes-based treatment.","Aberration of Notch signaling is one of the key events involved in the development and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The Notch pathway controls the tissue-specific differentiation of normal squamous epithelial cells and is frequently altered in squamous carcinomas, thus affecting their proliferation, growth, survival, and chemosensitivity or resistance against anti-cancer agents. In this study, we show that the use of novel, small-molecule inhibitors of Notch signaling, such as FLI-06, can have a beneficial effect on increasing the chemosensitivity of HNSCC to taxane-based chemotherapy. Inhibition of Notch signaling by FLI-06 alone virtually blocks the proliferation and growth of HNSCC cells in both 2D and 3D cultures and the zebrafish model, which is accompanied by down-regulation of key Notch target genes and proteins. Mechanistically, FLI-06 treatment causes cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>1</sub>-phase and induction of apoptosis in HNSCC, which is accompanied by increased c-Jun<sup>S63</sup> phosphorylation. Combining FLI-06 with Docetaxel shows a synergistic effect and partially blocks the cell growth of aggressive HNSCC cells via enhanced apoptosis and modification of c-Jun<sup>S243</sup> phosphorylation via GSK-3β inhibition. In conclusion, inhibition of Notch signaling in HNSCC cells that retain active Notch signaling significantly supports taxane-based anticancer activities via modulation of both the GSK-3β and the c-Jun.",2024-06-20
38904299,Discovery of Novel Small Molecule Dual Inhibitor Targeting Toll-Like Receptors 7 and 9.,"The aberrant secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by immune cells is the principal cause of inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9, sequestered to the endosomal compartment of dendritic cells and macrophages, are closely associated with the initiation and progression of these diseases. Therefore, the development of drugs targeting dysregulated endosomal TLRs is imperative to mitigate systemic inflammation. Here, we applied the principles of computer-aided drug discovery to identify a novel low-molecular-weight compound, TLR inhibitory compound 10 (TIC10), and its potent derivative (TIC10g), which demonstrated dual inhibition of TLR7 and TLR9 signaling pathways. Compared to TIC10, TIC10g exhibited a more pronounced inhibition of the TLR7- and TLR9-mediated secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α in a mouse macrophage cell line and mouse bone marrow dendritic cells in a concentration-dependent manner. While TIC10g slightly prevented TLR3 and TLR8 activation, it had no impact on cell surface TLRs (TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR4, or TLR5), indicating its selectivity for TLR7 and TLR9. Additionally, mechanistic studies suggested that TIC10g interfered with TLR9 activation by CpG DNA and suppressed downstream pathways by directly binding to TLR9. Western blot analysis revealed that TIC10g downregulated the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, p38-MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These findings indicate that the novel ligand, TIC10g, is a specific dual inhibitor of endosomal TLRs (TLR7 and TLR9), disrupting MAPK- and NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory gene expression.",2024-06-21
38899573,Screening optimal DC-targeting peptide to enhance the immune efficacy of recombinant <i>Lactobacillus</i> expressing RHDV VP60.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) present an ideal target for delivering immunogenic cargo due to their potent antigen-presenting capabilities. This targeting approach holds promise in vaccine development by enhancing the efficiency of antigen recognition and capture by DCs. To identify a high-affinity targeting peptide binding to rabbit DCs, rabbit monocyte-derived DCs (raMoDCs) were isolated and cultured, and a novel peptide, HS (HSLRHDYGYPGH), was identified using a phage-displayed peptide library. Alongside HS, two other DC-targeting peptides, KC1 and MY, previously validated in our laboratory, were employed to construct recombinant <i>Lactgobacillus reuteri</i> fusion-expressed rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) capsid protein VP60. These recombinant <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains were named HS-VP60/<i>L. reuteri</i>, KC1-VP60/<i>L. reuteri</i>, and MY-VP60/<i>L. reuteri</i>. The ability of these recombinant <i>Lactobacillus</i> to bind rabbit DCs was evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. Results demonstrated that the DC-targeting peptide KC1 significantly enhanced the capture efficiency of recombinant <i>Lactobacillus</i> by raMoDCs, promoted DC maturation, and increased cytokine secretion. Furthermore, oral administration of KC1-VP60/<i>L. reuteri</i> effectively induced SIgA and IgG production in rabbits, prolonged rabbit survival post-challenge, and reduced RHDV copies in organs. In summary, the DC-targeting peptide KC1 exhibited robust binding to raMoDCs, and recombinant <i>Lactobacillus</i> expressing KC1-VP60 protein antigens efficiently induced systemic and mucosal immune responses in rabbits, conferring protective efficacy against RHDV. This study offers valuable insights for the development of novel RHDV vaccines.",2024-06-20
38894923,Competitive Microarray Screening Reveals Functional Ligands for the DHX15 RNA G-Quadruplex.,"RNAs are increasingly considered valuable therapeutic targets, and the development of methods to identify and validate both RNA targets and ligands is more important than ever. Here, we utilized a bioinformatic approach to identify a hairpin-containing RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of <i>DHX15</i> mRNA. By using a novel competitive small molecule microarray (SMM) approach, we identified a compound that specifically binds to the <i>DHX15</i> rG4 (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub> = 12.6 ± 1.0 μM). This rG4 directly impacts translation of a <i>DHX15</i> reporter mRNA <i>in vitro</i>, and binding of our compound (<b>F1</b>) to the structure inhibits translation up to 57% (IC<sub>50</sub> = 22.9 ± 3.8 μM). This methodology allowed us to identify and target the mRNA of a cancer-relevant helicase with no known inhibitors. Our target identification method and the novelty of our screening approach make our work informative for future development of novel small molecule cancer therapeutics for RNA targets.",2024-05-02

38889796,A pan-respiratory antiviral chemotype targeting a transient host multi-protein complex.,"We present a novel small molecule antiviral chemotype that was identified by an unconventional cell-free protein synthesis and assembly-based phenotypic screen for modulation of viral capsid assembly. Activity of PAV-431, a representative compound from the series, has been validated against infectious viruses in multiple cell culture models for all six families of viruses causing most respiratory diseases in humans. In animals, this chemotype has been demonstrated efficacious for porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (a coronavirus) and respiratory syncytial virus (a paramyxovirus). PAV-431 is shown to bind to the protein 14-3-3, a known allosteric modulator. However, it only appears to target the small subset of 14-3-3 which is present in a dynamic multi-protein complex whose components include proteins implicated in viral life cycles and in innate immunity. The composition of this target multi-protein complex appears to be modified upon viral infection and largely restored by PAV-431 treatment. An advanced analog, PAV-104, is shown to be selective for the virally modified target, thereby avoiding host toxicity. Our findings suggest a new paradigm for understanding, and drugging, the host-virus interface, which leads to a new clinical therapeutic strategy for treatment of respiratory viral disease.",2024-06-19
38888047,Discovery and Development of NLRP3 Inhibitors Targeting the LRR Domain to Disrupt NLRP3-NEK7 Interaction for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease. Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome, specifically its interaction with NEK7 via the LRR domain of NLRP3, is a promising therapeutic strategy. Our research aimed to disrupt this interaction by focusing on the LRR domain. Through virtual screening, we identified five compounds with potent anti-inflammatory effects and ideal LRR binding affinity. Lead compound <b>C878-1943</b> underwent structural optimization, yielding pyridoimidazole derivatives with different anti-inflammatory activities. Compound <b>I-19</b> from the initial series effectively inhibited caspase-1 and IL-1β release in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model, significantly reducing joint swelling and spleen/thymus indices. To further enhance potency and extend <i>in vivo</i> half-life, a second series including <b>II-8</b> was developed, demonstrating superior efficacy and longer half-life. Both <b>I-19</b> and <b>II-8</b> bind to the LRR domain, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

ZIKV exploits autophagic processes in infected cells to enhance its replication and spread. Thus, autophagy inhibitors have emerged as a potent therapeutic target to combat RNA viruses, with Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) being one of the most promising candidates. In this study, we synthesized several novel small-molecule quinoline derivatives, assessed their antiviral activity, and determined the underlying molecular mechanisms. Among the nine synthesized analogs, two lead candidates, labeled GL-287 and GL-382, significantly attenuated ZIKV replication in human ocular cells, primarily by inhibiting autophagy. These two compounds surpassed the antiviral efficacy of HCQ and other existing autophagy inhibitors, such as ROC-325, DC661, and GNS561. Moreover, unlike HCQ, these novel analogs did not exhibit cytotoxicity in the ocular cells. Treatment with compounds GL-287 and GL-382 in ZIKV-infected cells increased the abundance of LC3 puncta, indicating the disruption of the autophagic process. Furthermore, compounds GL-287 and GL-382 effectively inhibited the ZIKV-induced innate inflammatory response in ocular cells. Collectively, our study demonstrates the safe and potent antiviral activity of novel autophagy inhibitors against ZIKV.",2024-06-18

38870120,A novel peptide derived from Zingiber cassumunar rhizomes exhibits anticancer activity against the colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) via the induction of intrinsic apoptosis signaling.,"This paper presents the initial exploration of the free radical scavenging capabilities of peptides derived from protein hydrolysates (PPH) obtained from Zingiber cassumunar rhizomes (Phlai). To replicate the conditions of gastrointestinal digestion, a combination of pepsin and pancreatin proteolysis was employed to generate these hydrolysates. Subsequently, the hydrolysate underwent fractionation using molecular weight cut-off membranes at 10, 5, 3, and 0.65 kDa. The fraction with a molecular weight less than 0.65 kDa exhibited the highest levels ABTS, DPPH, FRAP, and NO radical scavenging activity. Following this, RP-HPLC was used to further separate the fraction with a molecular weight less than 0.65 kDa into three sub-fractions. Among these, the F5 sub-fraction displayed the most prominent radical-scavenging properties. De novo peptide sequencing via quadrupole-time-of-flight-electron spin induction-mass spectrometry identified a pair of novel peptides: Asp-Gly-Ile-Phe-Val-Leu-Asn-Tyr (DGIFVLNY or DY-8) and Ile-Pro-Thr-Asp-Glu-Lys (IPTDEK or IK-6). Database analysis confirmed various properties, including biological activity, toxicity, hydrophilicity, solubility, and potential allergy concerns. Furthermore, when tested on the human adenocarcinoma colon (Caco-2) cell line, two synthetic peptides demonstrated cellular antioxidant activity in a concentration-dependent manner. These peptides were also assessed using the FITC Annexin V apoptosis detection kit with PI, confirming the induction of apoptosis. Notably, the DY-8 peptide induced apoptosis, upregulated mRNA levels of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and downregulated Bcl-2, as confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Western blot analysis indicated increased pro-apoptotic Bax expression and decreased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression in Caco-2 cells exposed to the DY-8 peptide. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the DY-8 peptide exhibited binding affinity with Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, suggesting potential utility in combating colon cancer as functional food ingredients.",2024-06-13

38857533,Elucidating the Molecular Basis of 14-3-3 Interaction with α-Synuclein: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations and the Design of a Novel Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitor.,"Parkinson's disease is a widespread age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain along with the appearance of protein aggregates, termed as ""Lewy bodies"" in the surviving neuronal cells. The components of Lewy bodies include proteins such as α-synuclein, 14-3-3, Parkin, and LRRK2, along with other cellular organelles, which, in their native state, perform a plethora of vital biological functions within the human biome. Formation of these aggregates renders these components inactive, thereby interfering with homeostasis. In this regard, the current study attempts to investigate the complexation behavior of all human-based 14-3-3 isoforms with α-synuclein via a combination of classical and enhanced sampling techniques and thereby determine the causality of these protein-protein interactions. The study indicated that upon complexation, the aggregation propensity of both 14-3-3 and α-synuclein increases, and this increment is propelled by the interfacial residues on either protein. Furthermore, mutagenesis studies revealed that Lys214 of 14-3-3 (henceforth termed K214A) is crucial for the formation of this binary complex. Principal component analysis combined with clustering studies unveiled the stability of these complexes in terms of their conformational distribution across the entire MD trajectory. For K214A, these clustered states were sparsely located, thereby making the transitions between them slightly difficult. Dynamic cross-correlation maps (DCCM) revealed the role of residues in the range 80-130 of 14-3-3 having a potential allosteric role in driving this complexation process. Finally, a novel peptide-based supramolecular inhibitor was designed, which exhibited higher proficiency in limiting the 14-3-3/α-synuclein interaction compared to the previous inhibitor model. It was also revealed that the presence of this inhibitor induces structural rigidity in α-synuclein, making changes in its conformations extremely difficult, as observed through Umbrella Sampling studies. Based on available information, the current study provides an insight into the molecular-level understanding of protein-protein interactions underlying Parkinson's disease and adds on to the methods of devising novel therapeutic approaches to treat the same.",2024-06-10
38854025,Exploring Integrin α5β1 as a Potential Therapeutic Target for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Insights from Comprehensive Multicenter Preclinical Studies.,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by obliterative vascular remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries (PA) and progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) leading to right ventricular (RV) failure. Although several drugs are approved for the treatment of PAH, mortality remains high. Accumulating evidence supports a pathological function of integrins in vessel remodeling, which are gaining renewed interest as drug targets. However, their role in PAH remains largely unexplored. We found that the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-binding integrin α5β1 is upregulated in PA endothelial cells (PAEC) and PA smooth muscle cells (PASMC) from PAH patients and remodeled PAs from animal models. Blockade of the integrin α5β1 or depletion of the α5 subunit resulted in mitotic defects and inhibition of the pro-proliferative and apoptosis-resistant phenotype of PAH cells. Using a novel small molecule integrin inhibitor and neutralizing antibodies, we demonstrated that α5β1 integrin blockade attenuates pulmonary vascular remodeling and improves hemodynamics and RV function in multiple preclinical models. Our results provide converging evidence to consider α5β1 integrin inhibition as a promising therapy for pulmonary hypertension.",2024-06-01
38851779,Rule-based omics mining reveals antimicrobial macrocyclic peptides against drug-resistant clinical isolates.,"Antimicrobial resistance remains a significant global threat, driving up mortality rates worldwide. Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides have emerged as a promising source of novel peptide antibiotics due to their diverse chemical structures. Here, we report the discovery of new aminovinyl-(methyl)cysteine (Avi(Me)Cys)-containing peptide antibiotics through a synergistic approach combining biosynthetic rule-based omics mining and heterologous expression. We first bioinformatically identify 1172 RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for Avi(Me)Cys-containing peptides formation from a vast pool of over 50,000 bacterial genomes. Subsequently, we successfully establish the connection between three identified BGCs and the biosynthesis of five peptide antibiotics via biosynthetic rule-guided metabolic analysis. Notably, we discover a class V lanthipeptide, massatide A, which displays excellent activity against gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant clinical isolates like linezolid-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.25 μg/mL. The remarkable performance of massatide A in an animal infection model, coupled with a relatively low risk of resistance and favorable safety profile, positions it as a promising candidate for antibiotic development. Our study highlights the potential of Avi(Me)Cys-containing peptides in expanding the arsenal of antibiotics against multi-drug-resistant bacteria, offering promising drug leads in the ongoing battle against infectious diseases.",2024-06-08
38847293,A Coordinating Small Organic Molecule with Tunable Lower Critical Solution Temperature for Efficient Management of Solar Radiation.,"Structurally well-defined small molecules with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior offer enormous prospects for fine-tuning their phase transition properties to be ""on-demand"" applied in the specific scene but are still underexplored. Herein, a novel amphiphilic small LCST molecule is rationally designed and synthesized. The molecule, namely TG, features a conjugation of multiple short ethylene glycol (EG) chains with the functional coordinating terpyridine (Tpy) moiety. The molecule TG demonstrates excellent LCST behavior down to 0.05 × 10<sup>-3</sup> m in a water solution. And a cloud point T<sub>cp</sub> = 30.9 °C with a very short thermal hysteresis ΔT = 0.2 °C and good reversibility can be achieved when c = 0.1<sup> </sup>× 10<sup>-3</sup> m. The excellent LCST properties of TG have enabled its successful performance as the smart window for solar radiation management with the ∆T<sub>lum</sub>, ∆T<sub>IR</sub>, and ∆T<sub>sol</sub> being 83.6%, 49.1%, and 67.2%, respectively. Moreover, the presence of Tpy moiety in TG enables its coordination with Ru<sup>3+</sup> and the resulting complex also exhibits modulated LCST behavior with different concentration-dependent T<sub>cp</sub>. These studies would provide novel small-molecule-based scaffolds for constructing better solar radiation management systems as well as other thermal-responsive smart materials.",2024-06-07
38846578,Machine learning enabled design features of antimicrobial peptides selectively targeting peri-implant disease progression.,"Peri-implantitis is a complex infectious disease that manifests as progressive loss of alveolar bone around the dental implants and hyper-inflammation associated with microbial dysbiosis. Using antibiotics in treating peri-implantitis is controversial because of antibiotic resistance threats, the non-selective suppression of pathogens and commensals within the microbial community, and potentially serious systemic sequelae. Therefore, conventional treatment for peri-implantitis comprises mechanical debridement by nonsurgical or surgical approaches with adjunct local microbicidal agents. Consequently, current treatment options may not prevent relapses, as the pathogens either remain unaffected or quickly re-emerge after treatment. Successful mitigation of disease progression in peri-implantitis requires a specific mode of treatment capable of targeting keystone pathogens and restoring bacterial community balance toward commensal species. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold promise as alternative therapeutics through their bacterial specificity and targeted inhibitory activity. However, peptide sequence space exhibits complex relationships such as sparse vector encoding of sequences, including combinatorial and discrete functions describing peptide antimicrobial activity. In this paper, we generated a transparent Machine Learning (ML) model that identifies sequence-function relationships based on rough set theory using simple summaries of the hydropathic features of AMPs. Comparing the hydropathic features of peptides according to their differential activity for different classes of bacteria empowered predictability of antimicrobial targeting. Enriching the sequence diversity by a genetic algorithm, we generated numerous candidate AMPs designed for selectively targeting pathogens and predicted their activity using classifying rough sets. Empirical growth inhibition data is iteratively fed back into our ML training to generate new peptides, resulting in increasingly more rigorous rules for which peptides match targeted inhibition levels for specific bacterial strains. The subsequent top scoring candidates were empirically tested for their inhibition against keystone and accessory peri-implantitis pathogens as well as an oral commensal bacterium. A novel peptide, VL-13, was confirmed to be selectively active against a keystone pathogen. Considering the continually increasing number of oral implants placed each year and the complexity of the disease progression, prevalence of peri-implant diseases continues to rise. Our approach offers transparent ML-enabled paths towards developing antimicrobial peptide-based therapies targeting the changes in the microbial communities that can beneficially impact disease progression.",2024-04-05
38846076,"Chemical synthesis of grafted cyclotides using a ""plug and play"" approach.","Cyclotides are a diverse class of plant-derived cyclic, disulfide-rich peptides with a unique cyclic cystine knot topology. Their remarkable structural stability and resistance to proteolytic degradation can lead to improved pharmacokinetics and oral activity as well as selectivity and high enzymatic stability. Thus, cyclotides have emerged as powerful scaffold molecules for designing peptide-based therapeutics. The chemical engineering of cyclotides has generated novel peptide ligands of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), today's most exploited drug targets. However key challenges potentially limit the widespread use of cyclotides in molecular grafting applications. Folding of cyclotides containing bioactive epitopes remains a major bottleneck in cyclotide synthesis. Here we present a modular 'plug and play' approach that effectively bypasses problems associated with the oxidative folding of cyclotides. By grafting onto a pre-formed acyclic cyclotide-like scaffold we show that difficult-to-graft sequences can be easily obtained and can target GPCRs with nanomolar affinities and potencies. We further show the suitability of this new method to graft other complex epitopes including structures with additional disulfide bonds that are not readily available <i>via</i> currently employed chemical methods, thus fully unlocking cyclotides to be used in drug design applications.",2024-04-29
38839973,Novel peptide inhibitor of human tumor necrosis factor-α has antiarthritic activity.,"The inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α trimer formation renders it inactive for binding to its receptors, thus mitigating the vicious cycle of inflammation. We designed a peptide (PIYLGGVFQ) that simulates a sequence strand of human TNFα monomer using a series of in silico methods, such as active site finding (Acsite), protein-protein interaction (PPI), docking studies (GOLD and Flex-X) followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. The MD studies confirmed the intermolecular interaction of the peptide with the TNFα. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and fluorescence microscopy revealed that the peptide effectively inhibited the binding of TNF to the cell surface receptors. The cell culture assays showed that the peptide significantly inhibited the TNFα-mediated cell death. In addition, the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) was significantly suppressed in the peptide-treated A549 cells, as observed in immunofluorescence and gel mobility-shift assays. Furthermore, the peptide protected against joint damage in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, as revealed in the micro focal-CT scans. In conclusion, this TNFα antagonist would be helpful for the prevention and repair of inflammatory bone destruction and subsequent loss in the mouse model of CIA as well as human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. This calls upon further clinical investigation to utilize its potential effect as an antiarthritic drug.",2024-06-05
38836467,A Top-Down Design Approach for Generating a Peptide PROTAC Drug Targeting Androgen Receptor for Androgenetic Alopecia Therapy.,"While large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models for protein structure prediction and design are advancing rapidly, the translation of deep learning models for practical macromolecular drug development remains limited. This investigation aims to bridge this gap by combining cutting-edge methodologies to create a novel peptide-based PROTAC drug development paradigm. Using ProteinMPNN and RFdiffusion, we identified binding peptides for androgen receptor (AR) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), followed by computational modeling with Alphafold2-multimer and ZDOCK to predict spatial interrelationships. Experimental validation confirmed the designed peptide's binding ability to AR and VHL. Transdermal microneedle patching technology was seamlessly integrated for the peptide PROTAC drug delivery in androgenic alopecia treatment. In summary, our approach provides a generic method for generating peptide PROTACs and offers a practical application for designing potential therapeutic drugs for androgenetic alopecia. This showcases the potential of interdisciplinary approaches in advancing drug development and personalized medicine.",2024-06-05
38821630,"<i>N</i>-(4-Bromo-2,5-Dimethoxyphenethyl)-6-(4-Phenylbutoxy)Hexan-1-Amine (XOB): A Novel Phenylalkylamine Antagonist of Serotonin 2A Receptors and Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels.","Bipolar disorder impacts millions of patients in the United States but the mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology and therapeutics is incomplete. Atypical antipsychotic serotonin<sub>2A</sub> (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) receptor antagonists, such as quetiapine and olanzapine, and mood-stabilizing voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blockers, such as lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and valproate, show therapeutic synergy and are often prescribed in combination for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Combination therapy is a complex task for clinicians and patients, often resulting in unexpected difficulties with dosing, drug tolerances, and decreased patient compliance. Thus, an unmet need for bipolar disorder treatment is to develop a therapeutic agent that targets both 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors and VGSCs. Toward this goal, we developed a novel small molecule that simultaneously antagonizes 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors and blocks sodium current. The new compound, <i>N</i>-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethyl)-6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexan-1-amine (XOB) antagonizes 5-HT-stimulated, G<sub>q</sub>-mediated, calcium flux at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors at low micromolar concentrations while displaying negligible affinity and activity at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. At similar concentrations, XOB administration inhibits sodium current in heterologous cells and results in reduced action potential (AP) firing and VGSC-related AP properties in mouse prefrontal cortex layer V pyramidal neurons. Thus, XOB represents a new, proof-of-principle tool that can be used for future preclinical investigations and therapeutic development. This polypharmacology approach of developing a single molecule to act upon two targets, which are currently independently targeted by combination therapies, may lead to safer alternatives for the treatment of psychiatric disorders that are increasingly being found to benefit from the simultaneous targeting of multiple receptors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The authors synthesized a novel small molecule (XOB) that simultaneously antagonizes two key therapeutic targets of bipolar disorder, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors and voltage-gated sodium channels, in heterologous cells, and inhibits the intrinsic excitability of mouse prefrontal cortex layer V pyramidal neurons in brain slices. XOB represents a valuable new proof-of-principle tool for future preclinical investigations and provides a novel molecular approach to the pharmacological treatment of complex neuropsychiatric disease, which often requires a combination of therapeutics for sufficient patient benefit.",2024-07-17
38818079,Cancer-Stem-Cell Phenotype-Guided Discovery of a Microbiota-Inspired Synthetic Compound Targeting NPM1 for Leukemia.,"The human microbiota plays an important role in human health and disease, through the secretion of metabolites that regulate key biological functions. We propose that microbiota metabolites represent an unexplored chemical space of small drug-like molecules in the search of new hits for drug discovery. Here, we describe the generation of a set of complex chemotypes inspired on selected microbiota metabolites, which have been synthesized using asymmetric organocatalytic reactions. Following a primary screening in CSC models, we identified the novel compound UCM-13369 (<b>4b</b>) whose cytotoxicity was mediated by NPM1. This protein is one of the most frequent mutations of AML, and NPM1-mutated AML is recognized by the WHO as a distinct hematopoietic malignancy. UCM-13369 inhibits NPM1 expression, downregulates the pathway associated with mutant NPM1 C+, and specifically recognizes the C-end DNA-binding domain of NPM1 C+, avoiding the nucleus-cytoplasm translocation involved in the AML tumorological process. The new NPM1 inhibitor triggers apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary cells from AML patients and reduces tumor infiltration in a mouse model of AML with NPM1 C+ mutation. The disclosed phenotype-guided discovery of UCM-13369, a novel small molecule inspired on microbiota metabolites, confirms that CSC death induced by NPM1 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic opportunity for NPM1-mutated AML, a high-mortality disease.",2024-02-09
38817611,MRGPRX2 antagonist GE1111 attenuated DNFB-induced atopic dermatitis in mice by reducing inflammatory cytokines and restoring skin integrity.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterised by itching, erythema, and epidermal barrier dysfunction. The pathogenesis of AD is complex and multifactorial; however,mast cell (MC) activation has been reported to be one of the crucial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AD. The MC receptor Mas related G protein-coupled receptor-X2 (MRGPRX2) has been identified as a prominent alternative receptor to the IgE receptor in causing MC activation and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators. The current study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a novel small molecule MRGPRX2 antagonist GE1111 in AD using in vitro and in vivo approaches.",2024-05-16
38814877,"Design, Synthesis, and Structure-Activity Relationships of Novel Peptide Derivatives of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 Spike-Protein that Potently Inhibit Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors.","The spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a distinctive amino-acid sequence (<sup>682</sup>RRARS<sup>686</sup>) that forms a cleavage site for the enzyme furin. Strikingly, the structure of the spike-protein loop containing the furin cleavage site bears substantial similarity to neurotoxin peptides found in the venoms of certain snakes and marine cone snails. Leveraging this relationship, we designed and synthesized disulfide-constrained peptides with amino-acid sequences corresponding to the furin cleavage-sites of wild-type (B.1 variant) SARS-CoV-2 or the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. Remarkably, some of these peptides potently inhibited α7 and α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) with nM affinity and showed SARS-CoV-2 variant and nAChR subtype-dependent potencies. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics were used to rationalize structure-activity relationships between peptides and their cognate receptors. These findings delineate nAChR subtypes that can serve as high-affinity spike-protein targets in tissues central to COVID-19 pathophysiology and identify ligands and target receptors to inform the development of novel SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.",2024-05-30

38811775,A novel small-molecule PCSK9 inhibitor E28362 ameliorates hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the epidermal growth factor precursor homologous domain A (EGF-A) of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in the liver and triggers the degradation of LDLR via the lysosomal pathway, consequently leading to an elevation in plasma LDL-C levels. Inhibiting PCSK9 prolongs the lifespan of LDLR and maintains cholesterol homeostasis in the body. Thus, PCSK9 is an innovative pharmacological target for treating hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. In this study, we discovered that E28362 was a novel small-molecule PCSK9 inhibitor by conducting a virtual screening of a library containing 40,000 compounds. E28362 (5, 10, 20 μM) dose-dependently increased the protein levels of LDLR in both total protein and the membrane fraction in both HepG2 and AML12 cells, and enhanced the uptake of DiI-LDL in AML12 cells. MTT assay showed that E28362 up to 80 μM had no obvious toxicity in HepG2, AML12, and HEK293a cells. The effects of E28362 on hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis were evaluated in three different animal models. In high-fat diet-fed golden hamsters, administration of E28362 (6.7, 20, 60 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.) for 4 weeks significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and PCSK9 levels, and reduced liver TC and TG contents. In Western diet-fed ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (20, 60 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.) and human PCSK9 D374Y overexpression mice (60 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.), administration of E28362 for 12 weeks significantly decreased plasma LDL-C levels and the area of atherosclerotic lesions in en face aortas and aortic roots. Moreover, E28362 significantly increased the protein expression level of LDLR in the liver. We revealed that E28362 selectively bound to PCSK9 in HepG2 and AML12 cells, blocked the interaction between LDLR and PCSK9, and induced the degradation of PCSK9 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which finally resulted in increased LDLR protein levels. In conclusion, E28362 can block the interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR, induce the degradation of PCSK9, increase LDLR protein levels, and alleviate hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in three distinct animal models, suggesting that E28362 is a promising lead compound for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.",2024-05-29
38795571,A novel approach to exploit Small-Molecule glucagon-like Peptide-1 receptor agonists with high potency.,"Small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are recognized as promising therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Danuglipron, an investigational small-molecule agonist, has demonstrated high efficacy in clinical trials. However, further development of danuglipron is challenged by a high rate of gastrointestinal adverse events. While these effects may be target-related, it is plausible that the carboxylic acid group present in danuglipron may also play a role in these outcomes by affecting the pharmacokinetic properties and dosing regimen of danuglipron, as well as by exerting direct gastrointestinal irritation. Therefore, this study aims to replace the problematic carboxylic acid group by exploring the internal binding cavity of danuglipron bound to GLP-1R using a water molecule displacement strategy. A series of novel triazole-containing compounds have been designed and synthesized during the structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. These efforts resulted in the discovery of compound 2j with high potency (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.065 nM). Moreover, docking simulations revealed that compound 2j directly interacts with the residue Glu387 within the internal cavity of GLP-1R, effectively displacing the structural water previously bound to Glu387. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that compound 2j had comparable efficacy to danuglipron in enhancing insulin secretion and improving glycemic control. Collectively, this study offers a practicable approach for the discovery of novel small-molecule GLP-1R agonists based on danuglipron, and compound 2j may serve as a lead compound to further exploit the unoccupied internal cavity of danuglipron's binding pocket.",2024-05-15
38791980,Sex Matters-Insights from Testing Drug Efficacy in an Animal Model of Pancreatic Cancer.,"Preclinical studies rarely test the efficacy of therapies in both sexes. The field of oncology is no exception in this regard. In a model of syngeneic, orthotopic, metastasized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma we evaluated the impact of sex on pathological features of this disease as well as on the efficacy and possible adverse side effects of a novel, small molecule-based therapy inhibiting KRAS:SOS1, MEK1/2 and PI3K signaling in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Male mice had less tumor infiltration of CD8-positive cells, developed bigger tumors, had more lung metastasis and a lower probability of survival compared to female mice. These more severe pathological features in male animals were accompanied by higher distress at the end of the experiment. The evaluated inhibitors BI-3406, trametinib and BKM120 showed synergistic effects in vitro. This combinatorial therapy reduced tumor weight more efficiently in male animals, although the drug concentrations were similar in the tumors of both sexes. These results underline the importance of sex-specific preclinical research and at the same time provide a solid basis for future studies with the tested compounds.",2024-05-16

38786597,Anti-Melanogenic Effects of <i>Takifugu flavidus</i> Muscle Hydrolysate in B16F10 Melanoma Cells and Zebrafish.,"Abnormal melanogenesis can lead to hyperpigmentation. Tyrosinase (TYR), a key rate-limiting enzyme in melanin production, is an important therapeutic target for these disorders. We investigated the TYR inhibitory activity of hydrolysates extracted from the muscle tissue of <i>Takifugu flavidus</i> (TFMH). We used computer-aided virtual screening to identify a novel peptide that potently inhibited melanin synthesis, simulated its binding mode to TYR, and evaluated functional efficacy in vitro and in vivo. TFMH inhibited the diphenolase activities of mTYR, reducing TYR substrate binding activity and effectively inhibiting melanin synthesis. TFMH indirectly reduced cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation in vitro by downregulating melanocortin 1 receptor expression, thereby inhibiting expression of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, further decreasing TYR, tyrosinase related protein 1, and dopachrome tautomerase expression and ultimately impeding melanin synthesis. In zebrafish, TFMH significantly reduced black spot formation. TFMH (200 μg/mL) decreased zebrafish TYR activity by 43% and melanin content by 52%. Molecular dynamics simulations over 100 ns revealed that the FGFRSP (T-6) peptide stably binds mushroom TYR via hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. T-6 (400 μmol/L) reduced melanin content in B16F10 melanoma cells by 71% and TYR activity by 79%. In zebrafish, T-6 (200 μmol/L) inhibited melanin production by 64%. TFMH and T-6 exhibit good potential for the development of natural skin-whitening cosmetic products.",2024-04-29

38765809,A Review of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis Classification With a Focus on Genetic Associations.,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) defines a distinct histologic pattern observed in kidney tissue that is linked to several distinct underlying causes, all converging on the common factor of podocyte injury. It presents a considerable challenge in terms of classification because of its varied underlying causes and the limited correlation between histopathology and clinical outcomes. Critically, precise nomenclature is key to describe and delineate the pathogenesis, subsequently guiding the selection of suitable and precision therapies. A proposed pathomechanism-based approach has been suggested for FSGS classification. This approach differentiates among primary, secondary, genetic, and undetermined causes, aiming to provide clarity. Genetic FSGS from monogenic mutations can emerge during childhood or adulthood, and it is advisable to conduct genetic testing in cases in which there is a family history of chronic kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, or resistance to treatment. Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic risk variants, such as those in apolipoprotein L1 (<i>APOL1</i>), that play a role in the development of FSGS. Currently, no specific treatments have been approved to treat genetic FSGS; however, interventions targeting underlying cofactor deficiencies have shown potential in some cases.

38739112,Discovery of Novel Small-Molecule-Based Potential PD-L1/EGFR Dual Inhibitors with High Druggability for Glioblastoma Immunotherapy.,"Based on the close relationship between programmed death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in glioblastoma (GBM), we designed and synthesized a series of small molecules as potential dual inhibitors of EGFR and PD-L1. Among them, compound <b>EP26</b> exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against EGFR (IC<sub>50</sub> = 37.5 nM) and PD-1/PD-L1 interaction (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.77 μM). In addition, <b>EP26</b> displayed superior <i>in vitro</i> antiproliferative activities and <i>in vitro</i> immunomodulatory effects by promoting U87MG cell death in a U87MG/Jurkat cell coculture model. Furthermore, <b>EP26</b> possessed favorable pharmacokinetic properties (<i>F</i> = 22%) and inhibited tumor growth (TGI = 92.0%) in a GBM mouse model more effectively than Gefitinib (77.2%) and NP19 (82.8%). Moreover, <b>EP26</b> increased CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in tumor microenvironment.

38731963,Novel Scorpion Toxin ω-Buthitoxin-Hf1a Selectively Inhibits Calcium Influx via Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 and Alleviates Allodynia in a Mouse Model of Acute Postsurgical Pain.,"Venom peptides have evolved to target a wide range of membrane proteins through diverse mechanisms of action and structures, providing promising therapeutic leads for diseases, including pain, epilepsy, and cancer, as well as unique probes of ion channel structure-function. In this work, a high-throughput FLIPR window current screening assay on T-type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 guided the isolation of a novel peptide named ω-Buthitoxin-Hf1a from scorpion <i>Hottentotta franzwerneri</i> crude venom. At only 10 amino acid residues with one disulfide bond, it is not only the smallest venom peptide known to target T-type Ca<sub>V</sub>s but also the smallest structured scorpion venom peptide yet discovered. Synthetic Hf1a peptides were prepared with C-terminal amidation (Hf1a-NH<sub>2</sub>) or a free C-terminus (Hf1a-OH). Electrophysiological characterization revealed Hf1a-NH<sub>2</sub> to be a concentration-dependent partial inhibitor of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.18 μM) and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.49 μM) depolarized currents but was ineffective at Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1. Hf1a-OH did not show activity against any of the three T-type subtypes. Additionally, neither form showed activity against N-type Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 or L-type calcium channels. The three-dimensional structure of Hf1a-NH<sub>2</sub> was determined using NMR spectroscopy and used in docking studies to predict its binding site at Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3. As both Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 have been implicated in peripheral pain signaling, the analgesic potential of Hf1a-NH<sub>2</sub> was explored in vivo in a mouse model of incision-induced acute post-surgical pain. Consistent with this role, Hf1a-NH<sub>2</sub> produced antiallodynia in both mechanical and thermal pain.",2024-04-26
38717088,Synthesis of Heterocyclic Ring-Fused Bisnoralcohol Derivatives as Novel Small-Molecule Antiosteoporosis Agents.,"A series of heterocyclic ring-fused derivatives of bisnoralcohol (BA) were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory effects on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Most of these derivatives possessed potent antiosteoporosis activities in a dose-dependent manner. Among these compounds, <b>31</b> (SH442, IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.052 μM) exhibited the highest potency, displaying 100% inhibition at 1.0 μM and 82.8% inhibition at an even lower concentration of 0.1 μM, which was much more potent than the lead compound BA (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.325 μM). Cytotoxicity tests suggested that the inhibitory effect of these compounds on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation did not result from their cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies revealed that SH442 inhibited the expression of osteoclastogenesis-related marker genes and proteins, including TRAP, TRAF6, c-Fos, CTSK, and MMP9. Especially, SH442 could significantly attenuate bone loss of ovariectomy mouse <i>in vivo</i>. Therefore, these BA derivatives could be used as promising leads for the development of a new type of antiosteoporosis agent.",2024-05-08
38704826,Engineering peptide drug therapeutics through chemical conjugation and implication in clinics.,"The development of peptide drugs has made tremendous progress in the past few decades because of the advancements in modification chemistry and analytical technologies. The novel-designed peptide drugs have been modified through various biochemical methods with improved diagnostic, therapeutic, and drug-delivery strategies. Researchers found it a helping hand to overcome the inherent limitations of peptides and bring continued advancements in their applications. Furthermore, the emergence of peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs)-utilizes target-oriented peptide moieties as a vehicle for cytotoxic payloads via conjugation with cleavable chemical agents, resulting in the key foundation of the new era of targeted peptide drugs.

38704069,A review on structure-function mechanism and signaling pathway of serine/threonine protein PIM kinases as a therapeutic target.,"The proviral integration for the Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases, belonging to serine/threonine kinase family, have been found to be overexpressed in various types of cancers, such as prostate, breast, colon, endometrial, gastric, and pancreatic cancer. The three isoforms PIM kinases i.e., PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3 share a high degree of sequence and structural similarity and phosphorylate substrates controlling tumorigenic phenotypes like proliferation and cell survival. Targeting short-lived PIM kinases presents an intriguing strategy as in vivo knock-down studies result in non-lethal phenotypes, indicating that clinical inhibition of PIM might have fewer adverse effects. The ATP binding site (hinge region) possesses distinctive attributes, which led to the development of novel small molecule scaffolds that target either one or all three PIM isoforms. Machine learning and structure-based approaches have been at the forefront of developing novel and effective chemical therapeutics against PIM in preclinical and clinical settings, and none have yet received approval for cancer treatment. The stability of PIM isoforms is maintained by PIM kinase activity, which leads to resistance against PIM inhibitors and chemotherapy; thus, to overcome such effects, PIM proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are now being developed that specifically degrade PIM proteins. In this review, we recapitulate an overview of the oncogenic functions of PIM kinases, their structure, function, and crucial signaling network in different types of cancer, and the potential of pharmacological small-molecule inhibitors. Further, our comprehensive review also provides valuable insights for developing novel antitumor drugs that specifically target PIM kinases in the future. In conclusion, we provide insights into the benefits of degrading PIM kinases as opposed to blocking their catalytic activity to address the oncogenic potential of PIM kinases.",2024-05-03
38699644,Potential therapeutic targets of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in triple-negative breast cancer.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses a significant clinical challenge due to its propensity for metastasis and poor prognosis. TNBC evades the body's immune system recognition and attack through various mechanisms, including the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. This pathway, characterized by heightened activity in numerous solid tumors, exhibits pronounced activation in specific TNBC subtypes. Consequently, targeting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway emerges as a promising and precise therapeutic strategy for TNBC. The signal transduction cascade of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway predominantly involves receptor tyrosine kinases, the tyrosine kinase JAK2, and the transcription factor STAT3. Ongoing preclinical studies and clinical research are actively investigating this pathway as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC treatment. This article comprehensively reviews preclinical and clinical investigations into TNBC treatment by targeting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway using small molecule compounds. The review explores the role of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in TNBC therapeutics, evaluating the benefits and limitations of active inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras in TNBC treatment. The aim is to facilitate the development of novel small-molecule compounds that target TNBC effectively. Ultimately, this work seeks to contribute to enhancing therapeutic efficacy for patients with TNBC.",2024-04-18

38686916,Identification of novel peptide inhibitors of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> dihydrofolate reductase (<i>Pf</i>DHFR): molecular docking and MD simulation studies.,"The presence of drug-resistant variants of Plasmodium parasites within the population has presented a substantial obstacle to the eradication of Malaria. As a result, numerous research groups have directed their efforts towards creating new medication candidates that specifically target parasites. In this study, our main objective was to identify tri-peptide inhibitors for <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Dihydrofolate Reductase (<i>Pf</i>DHFR) with the aim of finding a new peptide that exhibits superior binding properties compared to the current inhibitor, WR99210. In order to achieve this objective, a virtual library consisting of 8000 tripeptides was generated and subjected to computational screening against wild-type <i>Pf</i>DHFR. The purpose of this screening was to discover the most effective binders at the active site. The four most optimal tripeptides identified (Trp-Trp-Glu, Trp-Phe-Tyr, Phe-Trp-Trp, Tyr-Trp-Trp) exhibited significant non-covalent interactions inside the active site of <i>Pf</i>DHFR and had binding energies ranging from -9.5 to -9.0 kcal/mol and WR99210 had a binding energy of -6.2 kcal/mol. A 250 ns Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of the protein-ligand complexes. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values for the optimal tripeptides fell within the allowed range, indicating the stability of the ligands inside the protein complex. The K<sub>i</sub> value for the most effective tripeptide was 0.3482 µM, whereas WR99210 had a K<sub>i</sub> value of 1.02 µM. This article presents the initial discovery of peptide inhibitors targeting <i>Pf</i>DHFR. In this text, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the interactions that occur between peptides and the enzyme.",2024-04-30

38680429,Revolutionizing Peptide-Based Drug Discovery: Advances in the Post-AlphaFold Era.,"Peptide-based drugs offer high specificity, potency, and selectivity. However, their inherent flexibility and differences in conformational preferences between their free and bound states create unique challenges that have hindered progress in effective drug discovery pipelines. The emergence of AlphaFold (AF) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents new opportunities for enhancing peptide-based drug discovery. We explore recent advancements that facilitate a successful peptide drug discovery pipeline, considering peptides' attractive therapeutic properties and strategies to enhance their stability and bioavailability. AF enables efficient and accurate prediction of peptide-protein structures, addressing a critical requirement in computational drug discovery pipelines. In the post-AF era, we are witnessing rapid progress with the potential to revolutionize peptide-based drug discovery such as the ability to rank peptide binders or classify them as binders/non-binders and the ability to design novel peptide sequences. However, AI-based methods are struggling due to the lack of well-curated datasets, for example to accommodate modified amino acids or unconventional cyclization. Thus, physics-based methods, such as docking or molecular dynamics simulations, continue to hold a complementary role in peptide drug discovery pipelines. Moreover, MD-based tools offer valuable insights into binding mechanisms, as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of complexes. As we navigate this evolving landscape, a synergistic integration of AI and physics-based methods holds the promise of reshaping the landscape of peptide-based drug discovery.",2023-11-12

38675622,A Novel IRAK4 Inhibitor DW18134 Ameliorates Peritonitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"IRAK4 is a critical mediator in NF-κB-regulated inflammatory signaling and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases; however, none of its inhibitors have received FDA approval. In this study, we identified a novel small-molecule IRAK4 kinase inhibitor, DW18134, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 11.2 nM. DW18134 dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of IRAK4 and IKK in primary peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, inhibiting the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 in both cell lines. The in vivo study demonstrated the efficacy of DW18134, significantly attenuating behavioral scores in an LPS-induced peritonitis model. Mechanistically, DW18134 reduced serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels and attenuated inflammatory tissue injury. By directly blocking IRAK4 activation, DW18134 diminished liver macrophage infiltration and the expression of related inflammatory cytokines in peritonitis mice. Additionally, in the DSS-induced colitis model, DW18134 significantly reduced the disease activity index (DAI) and normalized food and water intake and body weight. Furthermore, DW18134 restored intestinal damage and reduced inflammatory cytokine expression in mice by blocking the IRAK4 signaling pathway. Notably, DW18134 protected DSS-threatened intestinal barrier function by upregulating tight junction gene expression. In conclusion, our findings reported a novel IRAK4 inhibitor, DW18134, as a promising candidate for treating inflammatory diseases, including peritonitis and IBD.",2024-04-16
38675451,Discovery of Small Molecule Glycolytic Stimulants for Enhanced ApoE Lipidation in Alzheimer's Disease Cell Model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by pathophysiological deposits of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau. The central role of Aβ in AD pathology is well-established, with its increased deposition attributed mainly to its decreased cerebral clearance. Here, it is noteworthy that apolipoprotein E (ApoE), the most significant risk factor for AD, has been shown to play an isoform-specific role in clearing Aβ deposits (ApoE2 > ApoE3 > ApoE4), owing mainly to its lipidation status. In addition to the pathophysiological Aβ deposits, AD is also characterized by abnormal glucose metabolism, which is a distinct event preceding Aβ deposition. The present study established, for the first time, a possible link between these two major AD etiologies, with glucose metabolism directly influencing ApoE lipidation and its secretion by astrocytes expressing human ApoE4. Specifically, glucose dose-dependently activated liver X receptor (LXR), leading to elevated ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels and enhanced ApoE lipidation. Moreover, co-treatment with a glycolytic inhibitor significantly inhibited this LXR activation and subsequent ApoE lipidation, further supporting a central role of glucose metabolism in LXR activation leading to enhanced ApoE lipidation, which may help against AD through potential Aβ clearance. Therefore, we hypothesized that pharmacological agents that can target cellular energy metabolism, specifically aerobic glycolysis, may hold significant therapeutic potential against AD. In this context, the present study also led to the discovery of novel, small-molecule stimulants of astrocytic glucose metabolism, leading to significantly enhanced lipidation status of ApoE4 in astrocytic cells. Three such newly discovered compounds (lonidamine, phenformin, and berberine), owing to their promising cellular effect on the glycolysis-ApoE nexus, warrant further investigation in suitable in vivo models of AD.",2024-04-12

Calcium-related channels play a regulatory role in maintaining calcium ion homeostasis, with most channels being highly expressed in tumor cells. Additionally, these channels serve as potential drug targets for the development of antitumor medications. In this review, we first discuss the current research status of these pathways, examining how they modulate various tumor functions such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metabolism, and drug resistance. Simultaneously, we summarize the recent progress in the study of novel small-molecule drugs over the past 5 years and their current status.",2024-04-24

Herein, we describe a novel small-molecule inhibitor for 14-3-3 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. The inhibitor was identified from unexpected products in a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) of an in-house chemical library. Mass spectroscopy, mutant-based analyses, fluorescence polarization assays, and thermal shift assays revealed that the inhibitor covalently binds to an allosteric site of 14-3-3 with isoform selectivity. Moreover, infiltration of the inhibitor to Arabidopsis leaves suppressed the stomatal aperture. The inhibitor should provide new insight into the design of potent and isoform-selective 14-3-3 modulators.",2024-05-27

38645276,Restoring cellular copper homeostasis in Alzheimer disease: a novel peptide shuttle is internalized by an ATP-dependent endocytosis pathway involving Rab5- and Rab14-endosomes.,"CPPs, or Cell-Penetrating Peptides, offer invaluable utility in disease treatment due to their ability to transport various therapeutic molecules across cellular membranes. Their unique characteristics, such as biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, make them ideal candidates for delivering drugs, genes, or imaging agents directly into cells. This targeted delivery enhances treatment efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects. CPPs exhibit versatility, crossing biological barriers and reaching intracellular targets that conventional drugs struggle to access. This capability holds promise in treating a wide array of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases, offering a potent avenue for innovative and targeted therapies, yet their precise mechanism of cell entry is far from being fully understood. In order to correct Cu dysregulation found in various pathologies such as Alzheimer disease, we have recently conceived a peptide Cu(II) shuttle, based on the αR5W4 CPP, which, when bound to Cu(II), is able to readily enter a neurosecretory cell model, and release bioavailable Cu in cells. Furthermore, this shuttle has the capacity to protect cells in culture against oxidative stress-induced damage which occurs when Cu binds to the Aβ peptide. The aim of this study was therefore to characterize the cell entry route used by this shuttle and determine in which compartment Cu is released. Pharmacological treatments, siRNA silencing and colocalization experiments with GFP-Rab fusion proteins, indicate that the shuttle is internalized by an ATP-dependent endocytosis pathway involving both Rab5 and Rab14 endosomes route and suggest an early release of Cu from the shuttle.",2024-04-05
38640722,Discovery of 4-phenyl-1H-indazole derivatives as novel small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.,"The inhibition of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway with small molecules is a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. Herein, novel small molecules compounds bearing various scaffolds including thiophene, thiazole, tetrahydroquinoline, benzimidazole and indazole were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Among them, compound Z13 exhibited the most potent activity with IC<sub>50</sub> of 189.6 nM in the homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) binding assay. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay demonstrated that Z13 bound to PD-L1 with high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> values of 231 nM and 311 nM for hPD-L1 and mPD-L1, respectively). In the HepG2/Jurkat T co-culture cell model, Z13 decreased the viability rate of HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, Z13 showed significant in vivo antitumor efficacy (TGI = 52.6 % at 40 mg/kg) without obvious toxicity in the B16-F10 melanoma model. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that Z13 inhibited tumor growth in vivo by activating the tumor immune microenvironment. These findings indicate that Z13 is a promising PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor deserving further investigation.",2024-04-16
38639572,Belzutifan: a novel therapeutic for the management of von Hippel-Lindau disease and beyond.,"The identification of the <i>VHL</i> gene and its role in regulating the hypoxia-inducible factor signaling pathway has helped to revolutionize the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

38636434,The novel small molecule E0924G dually regulates bone formation and bone resorption through activating the PPARδ signaling pathway to prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rats and senile mice.,"Osteoporosis is particularly prevalent among postmenopausal women and the elderly. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the novel small molecule E0924G (N-(4-methoxy-pyridine-2-yl)-5-methylfuran-2-formamide) on osteoporosis. E0924G significantly increased the protein expression levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and thus significantly promoted osteogenesis in MC3T3-E1 cells. E0924G also significantly decreased osteoclast differentiation and inhibited bone resorption and F-actin ring formation in receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclasts from RAW264.7 macrophages. Importantly, oral administration of E0924G in both ovariectomized (OVX) rats and SAMP6 senile mice significantly increased bone mineral density and decreased bone loss compared to OVX controls or SAMR1 mice. Further mechanistic studies showed that E0924G could bind to and then activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ), and the pro-osteoblast effect and the inhibition of osteoclast differentiation induced by E0924G were significantly abolished when PPARδ was knocked down or inhibited. In conclusion, these data strongly suggest that E0924G has the potential to prevent OVX-induced and age-related osteoporosis by dual regulation of bone formation and bone resorption through activation of the PPARδ signaling pathway.",2024-04-11
38633584,Novel Peptide DR3penA as a Low-Toxicity Antirenal Fibrosis Agent by Suppressing the TGF-β1/miR-212-5p/Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor Class a Domain Containing 4/Smad Axis.,"Renal fibrosis is a complex pathological process that contributes to the development of chronic kidney disease due to various risk factors. Conservative treatment to curb progression without dialysis or renal transplantation is widely applicable, but its effectiveness is limited. Here, the inhibitory effect of the novel peptide DR3penA (DHα-(4-pentenyl)-AlaNPQIR-NH<sub>2</sub>), which was developed by our group, on renal fibrosis was assessed in cells and mice with established fibrosis and fibrosis triggered by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), unilateral ureteral obstruction, and repeated low-dose cisplatin. DR3penA preserved renal function and ameliorated renal fibrosis at a dose approximately 100 times lower than that of captopril, which is currently used in the clinic. DR3penA also significantly reduced existing fibrosis and showed similar efficacy after subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection. Mechanistically, DR3penA repressed TGF-β1 signaling via miR-212-5p targeting of low-density lipoprotein receptor class a domain containing 4, which interacts with Smad2/3. In addition to having good pharmacological effects, DR3penA could preferentially target injured kidneys and exhibited low toxicity in acute and chronic toxicity experiments. These results unveil the advantages of DR3penA regarding efficacy and toxicity, making it a potential candidate compound for renal fibrosis therapy.",2024-03-14
38633583,Novel BRD4-p53 Inhibitor SDU-071 Suppresses Proliferation and Migration of MDA-MB-231 Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.,"A promising alternative for cancer treatment involves targeted inhibition of the epigenetic regulator bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4); however, available BRD4 inhibitors are constrained by their potency, oral bioavailability, and cytotoxicity. Herein, to overcome the drawback of the translational BRD4 inhibitors, we describe a novel BRD4-p53 inhibitor, SDU-071, which suppresses BRD4 interaction with the p53 tumor suppressor and its biological activity in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro and in vivo. This novel small-molecule BRD4-p53 inhibitor suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by downregulating the expression of BRD4-targeted genes, such as c-Myc and Mucin 5AC, and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as demonstrated in cultured MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. Its antitumor activity is illustrated in an orthotopic mouse xenograft mammary tumor model. Overall, our results show that SDU-071 is a viable option for potentially treating TNBC as a new BRD4-p53 inhibitor.",2024-03-12
38626518,Novel small molecule DMAMCL induces differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma by downregulating of DLL1.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a mesenchymal tumor occurring in the soft tissue of children, is associated with a defect in differentiation. This study unveils a novel anti-tumor mechanism of dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL), which is a water-soluble derivative of Micheliolide. First, we demonstrate that DMAMCL inhibits RMS cell growth without obvious cell death, leading to morphological alterations, enhanced expression of muscle differentiation markers, and a shift from a malignant to a more benign metabolic phenotype. Second, we detected decreased expression of DLL1 in RMS cells after DMAMCL treatment, known as a pivotal ligand in the Notch signaling pathway. Downregulation of DLL1 inhibits RMS cell growth and induces morphological changes similar to the effects of DMAMCL. Furthermore, DMAMCL treatment or loss of DLL1 expression also inhibits RMS xenograft tumor growth and augmented the expression of differentiation markers. Surprisingly, in C2C12 cells DMAMCL treatment or DLL1 downregulation also induces cell growth inhibition and an elevation in muscle differentiation marker expression. These data indicated that DMAMCL induced RMS differentiation and DLL1 is an important factor for RMS differentiation, opening a new window for the clinical use of DMAMCL as an agent for differentiation-inducing therapy for RMS treatment.",2024-04-15
38612681,Integrated Transcriptomic and Proteomic Study of the Mechanism of Action of the Novel Small-Molecule Positive Allosteric Modulator 1 in Targeting PAC1-R for the Treatment of D-Gal-Induced Aging Mice.,"Small-molecule positive allosteric modulator 1 (SPAM1), which targets pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor 1 (PAC1-R), has been found to have a neuroprotective effect, and the underlying mechanism was explored in this study. First, using a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging mouse model, we confirmed that SPAM1 improves the structure of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and restores the number of neurons. Compared with D-gal model mice, SPAM1-treated mice showed up-regulated expression of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and Lamin B1 and down-regulated expression of YinYang 1 (YY1) and p16. A similar tendency was observed in senescent RGC-5 cells induced by long-term culture, indicating that SPAM1 exhibits significant in vitro and in vivo anti-senescence activity in neurons. Then, using whole-transcriptome sequencing and proteomic analysis, we further explored the mechanism behind SPAM1's neuroprotective effects and found that SPAM is involved in the longevity-regulating pathway. Finally, the up-regulation of neurofilament light and medium polypeptides indicated by the proteomics results was further confirmed by Western blotting. These results help to lay a pharmacological network foundation for the use of SPAM1 as a potent anti-aging therapeutic drug to combat neurodegeneration with anti-senescence, neuroprotective, and nerve regeneration activity.",2024-03-30
38611715,Identification and Biological Evaluation of a Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor of Ricin Toxin.,"The plant-derived toxin ricin is classified as a type 2 ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) and currently lacks effective clinical antidotes. The toxicity of ricin is mainly due to its ricin toxin A chain (RTA), which has become an important target for drug development. Previous studies have identified two essential binding pockets in the active site of RTA, but most existing inhibitors only target one of these pockets. In this study, we used computer-aided virtual screening to identify a compound called RSMI-29, which potentially interacts with both active pockets of RTA. We found that RSMI-29 can directly bind to RTA and effectively attenuate protein synthesis inhibition and rRNA depurination induced by RTA or ricin, thereby inhibiting their cytotoxic effects on cells in vitro. Moreover, RSMI-29 significantly reduced ricin-mediated damage to the liver, spleen, intestine, and lungs in mice, demonstrating its detoxification effect against ricin in vivo. RSMI-29 also exhibited excellent drug-like properties, featuring a typical structural moiety of known sulfonamides and barbiturates. These findings suggest that RSMI-29 is a novel small-molecule inhibitor that specifically targets ricin toxin A chain, providing a potential therapeutic option for ricin intoxication.",2024-03-22
38611022,"The Therapeutic Efficacy and Mechanism of Action of Gnetin C, a Natural Compound from the Melinjo Plant, in a Preclinical Mouse Model of Advanced Prostate Cancer.","The metastasis-associated protein 1/protein kinase B (MTA1/AKT) signaling pathway has been shown to cooperate in promoting prostate tumor growth. Targeted interception strategies by plant-based polyphenols, specifically stilbenes, have shown great promise against MTA1-mediated prostate cancer progression. In this study, we employed a prostate-specific transgenic mouse model with MTA1 overexpression on the background of phosphatase and tensin homolog (<i>Pten</i>) null (<i>R26<sup>MTA1</sup></i>; <i>Pten<sup>f/f</sup></i>) and PC3M prostate cancer cells which recapitulate altered molecular pathways in advanced prostate cancer. Mechanistically, the MTA1 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of MTA1 by gnetin C (dimer resveratrol) in cultured PC3M cells resulted in the marked inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In vivo, mice tolerated a daily intraperitoneal treatment of gnetin C (7 mg/kg bw) for 12 weeks without any sign of toxicity. Treatment with gnetin C markedly reduced cell proliferation and angiogenesis and promoted apoptosis in mice with advanced prostate cancer. Further, in addition to decreasing MTA1 levels in prostate epithelial cells, gnetin C significantly reduced mTOR signaling activity in prostate tissues, including the activity of mTOR-target proteins: p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E (elF4E)-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). Collectively, these findings established gnetin C as a new natural compound with anticancer properties against MTA1/AKT/mTOR-activated prostate cancer, with potential as monotherapy and as a possible adjunct to clinically approved mTOR pathway inhibitors in the future.",2024-03-29
38599565,Discovery and validation of a novel inhibitor of HYPE-mediated AMPylation.,"Adenosyl monophosphate (AMP)ylation (the covalent transfer of an AMP from Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) onto a target protein) is catalyzed by the human enzyme Huntingtin Yeast Interacting Partner E (HYPE)/FicD to regulate its substrate, the heat shock chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). HYPE-mediated AMPylation of BiP is critical for maintaining proteostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum and mounting a unfolded protein response in times of proteostatic imbalance. Thus, manipulating HYPE's enzymatic activity is a key therapeutic strategy toward the treatment of various protein misfolding diseases, including neuropathy and early-onset diabetes associated with two recently identified clinical mutations of HYPE. Herein, we present an optimized, fluorescence polarization-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to discover activators and inhibitors of HYPE-mediated AMPylation. After challenging our HTS assay with over 30,000 compounds, we discovered a novel AMPylase inhibitor, I2.10. We also determined a low micromolar IC50 for I2.10 and employed biorthogonal counter-screens to validate its efficacy against HYPE's AMPylation of BiP. Further, we report low cytotoxicity of I2.10 on human cell lines. We thus established an optimized, high-quality HTS assay amenable to tracking HYPE's enzymatic activity at scale, and provided the first novel small-molecule inhibitor capable of perturbing HYPE-directed AMPylation of BiP in vitro. Our HTS assay and I2.10 compound serve as a platform for further development of HYPE-specific small-molecule therapeutics.",2024-04-09
38595070,Self-assembly of peptides in living cells for disease theranostics.,"The past few decades have witnessed substantial progress in biomedical materials for addressing health concerns and improving disease therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy. Conventional biomedical materials are typically created through an <i>ex vivo</i> approach and are usually utilized under physiological environments <i>via</i> transfer from preparative media. This transfer potentially gives rise to challenges for the efficient preservation of the bioactivity and implementation of theranostic goals on site. To overcome these issues, the <i>in situ</i> synthesis of biomedical materials on site has attracted great attention in the past few years. Peptides, which exhibit remarkable biocompability and reliable noncovalent interactions, can be tailored <i>via</i> tunable assembly to precisely create biomedical materials. In this review, we summarize the progress in the self-assembly of peptides in living cells for disease diagnosis and therapy. After a brief introduction to the basic design principles of peptide assembly systems in living cells, the applications of peptide assemblies for bioimaging and disease treatment are highlighted. The challenges in the field of peptide self-assembly in living cells and the prospects for novel peptide assembly systems towards next-generation biomaterials are also discussed, which will hopefully help elucidate the great potential of peptide assembly in living cells for future healthcare applications.",2024-05-08
38594241,A novel small molecule inhibitor of CD73 triggers immune-mediated multiple myeloma cell death.,"CD73 is the key ectoenzyme involved in the generation of AMP-derived adenosine, which contributes to immunosuppression in the MM BM milieu. Blocking CD73 activity with a potent, selective, orally bioavailable CD73 inhibitor ORIC-533 decreases adenosine generation, overcomes immune suppression, and restores immune cell-mediated MM cell lysis. Based on these preclinical studies, a multi-center clinical trial of ORIC-533 has been initiated in patients with relapsed refractory MM (NCT05227144).",2024-04-09
38583575,A novel peptide-drug conjugate for glioma-targeted drug delivery.,"The existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB) greatly limits the application of chemotherapy in glioma. To address this challenge, an optimal drug delivery system must efficiently cross the BBB/BBTB and specifically deliver therapeutic drugs into glioma cells while minimizing systemic toxicity. Here we demonstrated that glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and dopamine receptor D2 were highly expressed in patient-derived glioma tissues, and dopamine receptors were highly expressed on the BBB. Subsequently, we synthesized a novel ""Y""-shaped peptide and compared the effects of different linkers on the receptor affinity and targeting ability of the peptide. A peptide-drug conjugate (pHA-AOHX-VAP-doxorubicin conjugate, pHA-AOHX-VAP-DOX) with a better affinity for glioma cells and higher solubility was derived for glioma treatment. pHA-AOHX-VAP-DOX could cross both BBB and BBTB via dopamine receptor and GRP78 receptor, and finally target glioma cells, significantly prolonging the survival time of nude mice bearing intracranial glioma. Furthermore, pHA-AOHX-VAP-DOX significantly reduced the toxicity of DOX and increased the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Collectively, this work paves a new avenue for overcoming multiple barriers and effectively delivering chemotherapeutic agents to glioma cells while providing key evidence to identify potential receptors for glioma-targeted drug delivery.",2024-04-13
38579616,Discovery of a novel small-molecule activator of SIRT3 that inhibits cell proliferation and migration by apoptosis and autophagy-dependent cell death pathways in colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is well known as a prevalent malignancy affecting the digestive tract, yet its precise etiological determinants remain to be elusive. Accordingly, identifying specific molecular targets for colorectal cancer and predicting potential malignant tumor behavior are potential strategies for therapeutic interventions. Of note, apoptosis (type I programmed cell death) has been widely reported to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis by exerting a suppressive effect on cancer development. Moreover, autophagy-dependent cell death (type II programmed cell death) has been implicated in different types of human cancers. Thus, investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis and autophagy-dependent cell death is paramount in treatment modalities of colorectal cancer. In this study, we uncovered that a new small-molecule activator of SIRT3, named MY-13, triggered both autophagy-dependent cell death and apoptosis by modulating the SIRT3/Hsp90/AKT signaling pathway. Consequently, this compound inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration in RKO and HCT-116 cell lines. Moreover, we further demonstrated that the small-molecule activator significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the novel small-molecule activator of SIRT3 may hold a therapeutic potential as a drug candidate in colorectal cancer.",2024-04-02
38579401,A novel HDAC8 inhibitor H7E exerts retinoprotective effects against glaucomatous injury via ameliorating aberrant Müller glia activation and oxidative stress.,"Glaucoma is considered a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive visual field defects that may lead to blindness. Although controlling intraocular pressure (IOP) is the mainstay of glaucoma treatment, some glaucoma patients have unmet needs due to unclear pathogenic mechanisms. Recently, there has been growing evidence that neuroinflammation is a potential target for the development of novel antiglaucoma agents. In this study, we investigated the protective effects and cellular mechanisms of H7E, a novel small molecule inhibits HDAC8, using in vitro and in vivo glaucoma-like models. Importantly, H7E mitigated extracellular MMP-9 activity and MCP-1 levels in glutamate- or S100B-stimulated reactive Müller glia. In addition, H7E inhibited the upregulation of inflammation- and proliferation-related signaling pathways, particularly the ERK and JNK MAPK pathways. Under conditions of oxidative damage, H7E prevents retinal cell death and reduces extracellular glutamate released from stressed Müller glia. In a mouse model of NMDA-induced retinal degeneration, H7E alleviated functional and structural defects within the inner retina as assessed by electroretinography and optical coherence tomography. Our results demonstrated that the newly identified compound H7E protects against glaucoma damage by specifically targeting HDAC8 activity in the retina. This protective effect is attributed to the inhibition of Müller glial activation and the prevention of retinal cell death caused by oxidative stress.",2024-04-04
38572099,Novel Pt(IV) complex OAP2 induces STING activation and pyroptosis <i>via</i> mitochondrial membrane remodeling for synergistic chemo-immunotherapy.,"Mitochondrial membrane remodeling can trigger the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), leading to the activation of cellular oxidative stress and immune responses. While the role of mitochondrial membrane remodeling in promoting inflammation in hepatocytes is well-established, its effects on tumors have remained unclear. In this study, we designed a novel Pt(IV) complex, OAP2, which is composed of oxaliplatin (Oxa) and acetaminophen (APAP), to enhance its anti-tumor effects and amplify the immune response. Our findings demonstrate that OAP2 induces nuclear DNA damage, resulting in the production of nuclear DNA. Additionally, OAP2 downregulates the expression of mitochondrial Sam50, to promote mitochondrial membrane remodeling and trigger mtDNA secretion, leading to double-stranded DNA accumulation and ultimately synergistically activating the intracellular cGAS-STING pathway. The mitochondrial membrane remodeling induced by OAP2 overcomes the limitations of Oxa in activating the STING pathway and simultaneously promotes gasdermin-D-mediated cell pyroptosis. OAP2 also promotes dendritic cell maturation and enhances the quantity and efficacy of cytotoxic T cells, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Briefly, our study introduces the first novel small-molecule inhibitor that regulates mitochondrial membrane remodeling for active immunotherapy in anti-tumor research, which may provide a creative idea for targeting organelle in anti-tumor therapy.",2023-12-16
38567350,PCC0208057 as a small molecule inhibitor of TRPC6 in the treatment of prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common malignant tumor, whose morbidity and mortality keep the top three in the male-related tumors in developed countries. Abnormal ion channels, such as transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6), are reported to be involved in the carcinogenesis and progress of prostate cancer and have become potential drug targets against prostate cancer. Here, we report a novel small molecule inhibitor of TRPC6, designated as PCC0208057, which can suppress the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells <i>in vitro</i>, and inhibit the formation of Human umbilical vein endothelial cells cell lumen. PCC0208057 can effectively inhibit the growth of xenograft tumor <i>in vivo</i>. Molecular mechanism studies revealed that PCC0208057 could directly bind and inhibit the activity of TRPC6, which then induces the prostate cancer cells arrested in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase <i>via</i> enhancing the phosphorylation of Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells (NFAT) and Cdc2. Taken together, our study describes for the first time that PCC0208057, a novel TRPC6 inhibitor, might be a promising lead compound for treatment of prostate cancer.",2024-03-18
38565058,"Multitarget action of Benzothiazole-piperazine small hybrid molecule against Alzheimer's disease: In silico, In vitro, and In vivo investigation.","A novel small molecule based on benzothiazole-piperazine has been identified as an effective multi-target-directed ligand (MTDL) against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Employing a medicinal chemistry approach, combined with molecular docking, MD simulation, and binding free energy estimation, compound 1 emerged as a potent MTDL against AD. Notably, compound 1 demonstrated efficient binding to both AChE and Aβ1-42, involving crucial molecular interactions within their active sites. It displayed a binding free energy (ΔG<sub>bind</sub>) -18.64± 0.16 and -16.10 ± 0.18 kcal/mol against AChE and Aβ1-42, respectively.

In vitro analysis confirmed compound 1 (IC<sub>50</sub>=0.42 μM) as an effective, mixed-type, and selective AChE inhibitor, binding at both the enzyme's catalytic and peripheral anionic sites. Furthermore, compound 1 demonstrated a remarkable ability to reduce the aggregation propensity of Aβ, as evidenced by Confocal laser scanning microscopy and TEM studies. Remarkably, in vivo studies exhibited the promising therapeutic potential of compound 1. In a scopolamine-induced memory deficit mouse model of AD, compound 1 showed significantly improved spatial memory and cognition. These findings collectively underscore the potential of compound 1 as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AD.",2024-04-01
38562022,Small Molecule IITR08367 Potentiates Antibacterial Efficacy of Fosfomycin against <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> by Efflux Pump Inhibition.,"Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum single-dose therapy approved for treating lower urinary tract infections. <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, one of the five major UTI-causing pathogens, is intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin. Reduced uptake and active efflux are major reasons for this intrinsic resistance. AbaF, a major facilitator superfamily class of transporter in <i>A. baumannii</i>, is responsible for fosfomycin efflux and biofilm formation. This study describes the identification and validation of a novel small-molecule efflux pump inhibitor that potentiates fosfomycin efficacy against <i>A. baumannii</i>. An AbaF inhibitor screening was performed against <i>Escherichia coli</i> KAM32/pUC18_abaF, using the noninhibitory concentration of 24 putative efflux pump inhibitors. The inhibitory activity of IITR08367 [bis(4-methylbenzyl) disufide] against fosfomycin/H<sup>+</sup> antiport was validated using ethidium bromide efflux, quinacrine-based proton-sensitive fluorescence, and membrane depolarization assays. IITR08367 inhibits fosfomycin/H<sup>+</sup> antiport activity by perturbing the transmembrane proton gradient. IITR08367 is a nontoxic molecule that potentiates fosfomycin activity against clinical strains of <i>A. baumannii</i> and prevents biofilm formation by inhibiting efflux pump (AbaF). The IITR08367-fosfomycin combination reduced bacterial burden by > 3 log<sub>10</sub> in kidney and bladder tissue in the murine UTI model. Overall, fosfomycin, in combination with IITR08367, holds the potential to treat urinary tract infections caused by <i>A. baumannii</i>.",2024-04-01
38560505,Remodeling the immune microenvironment for gastric cancer therapy through antagonism of prostaglandin E2 receptor 4.,"Gastric cancer is highly prevalent among digestive tract tumors. Due to the intricate nature of the gastric cancer immune microenvironment, there is currently no effective treatment available for advanced gastric cancer. However, there is promising potential for immunotherapy targeting the prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype 4 (EP4) in gastric cancer. In our previous study, we identified a novel small molecule EP4 receptor antagonist called YY001. Treatment with YY001 alone demonstrated a significant reduction in gastric cancer growth and inhibited tumor metastasis to the lungs in a mouse model. Furthermore, administration of YY001 stimulated a robust immune response within the tumor microenvironment, characterized by increased infiltration of antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and M1 macrophages. Additionally, our research revealed that YY001 exhibited remarkable synergistic effects when combined with the PD-1 antibody and the clinically targeted drug apatinib, rather than fluorouracil. These findings suggest that YY001 holds great promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer, whether used as a standalone treatment or in combination with other drugs.",2023-11-10
38558423,"VDX-111, a novel small molecule, induces necroptosis to inhibit ovarian cancer progression.","Epithelial ovarian cancers that are nonhomologous recombination deficient, as well as those that are recurrent and in a platinum-resistant state, have limited therapeutic options. The objectives of this study were to characterize the mechanism of action and investigate the therapeutic potential of a small molecule, VDX-111, against ovarian cancer. We examined the ability of VDX-111 to inhibit the growth of a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, focusing on BRCA wild-type lines. We found that VDX-111 causes a dose-dependent loss of cell viability across ovarian cancer cell lines. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis was used to identify changes in cell signaling in response to VDX-111 treatment. An RPPA analysis performed on cells treated with VDX-111 detected changes in cell signaling related to autophagy and necroptosis. Immunoblots of OVCAR3 and SNU8 cells confirmed a dose-dependent increase in LC3A/B and RIPK1. Incucyte live cell imaging was used to measure cell proliferation and death in response to VDX-111 alone and with inhibitors of apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy. Annexin/PI assays suggested predominantly nonapoptotic cell death, while real-time kinetic imaging of cell growth indicated the necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1, attenuates VDX-111-induced loss of cell viability, suggesting a necroptosis-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, VDX-111 inhibited tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft and syngeneic murine models. In conclusion, the cytotoxic effects of VDX-111 seen in vitro and in vivo appear to occur in a necroptosis-dependent manner and may promote an antitumor immune response.",2024-04-01
38557024,Molecular Design of SERTlight: A Fluorescent Serotonin Probe for Neuronal Labeling in the Brain.,"The serotonergic transmitter system plays fundamental roles in the nervous system in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, pathological processes, and therapeutic effects of antidepressants and psychedelics, as well as in the gastrointestinal and circulatory systems. We introduce a novel small molecule fluorescent agent, termed <b>SERTlight</b>, that specifically labels serotonergic neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axonal projections as a serotonin transporter (SERT) fluorescent substrate. SERTlight was developed by an iterative molecular design process, based on an aminoethyl-quinolone system, to integrate structural elements that impart SERT substrate activity, sufficient fluorescent brightness, and a broad absence of pharmacological activity, including at serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) receptors, other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and monoamine transporters. The high labeling selectivity is not achieved by high affinity binding to SERT itself but rather by a sufficient rate of SERT-mediated transport of SERTlight, resulting in accumulation of these molecules in 5HT neurons and yielding a robust and selective optical signal in the mammalian brain. SERTlight provides a stable signal, as it is not released via exocytosis nor by reverse SERT transport induced by 5HT releasers such as MDMA. SERTlight is optically, pharmacologically, and operationally orthogonal to a wide range of genetically encoded sensors, enabling multiplexed imaging. SERTlight enables labeling of distal 5HT axonal projections and simultaneous imaging of the release of endogenous 5HT using the GRAB<sub>5HT</sub> sensor, providing a new versatile molecular tool for the study of the serotonergic system.",2024-04-01
38554143,Synthesis and Evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-c-<sup>D</sup>VAP: A Novel PET Probe for Imaging GRP78 in Cancer.,"GRP78, a member of the HSP70 superfamily, is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein overexpressed in various cancers, making it a promising target for cancer imaging and therapy. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging offers unique advantages in real time, noninvasive tumor imaging, rendering it a suitable tool for targeting GRP78 in tumor imaging to guide targeted therapy. Several studies have reported successful tumor imaging using PET probes targeting GRP78. However, existing PET probes face challenges such as low tumor uptake, inadequate in vivo distribution, and high abdominal background signal. Therefore, this study introduces a novel peptide PET probe, [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-c-<sup>D</sup>VAP, for targeted tumor imaging of GRP78. [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-c-<sup>D</sup>VAP was radiolabeled with fluoride-18 using the aluminum-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoride ([<sup>18</sup>F]AlF) method. The study assessed the partition coefficients, stability in vitro, and metabolic stability of [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-c-<sup>D</sup>VAP. Micro-PET imaging, pharmacokinetic analysis, and biodistribution studies were carried out in tumor-bearing mice to evaluate the probe's performance. Docking studies and pharmacokinetic analyses of [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-c-<sup>D</sup>VAP were also performed. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses were conducted to confirm GRP78 expression in tumor tissues. The probe's binding affinity to GRP78 was analyzed by molecular docking simulation. [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-c-<sup>D</sup>VAP was radiolabeled in just 25 min with a high yield of 51 ± 16%, a radiochemical purity of 99%, and molar activity within the range of 20-50 GBq/μmol. [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-c-<sup>D</sup>VAP demonstrated high stability in vitro and in vivo, with a logD value of -3.41 ± 0.03. Dynamic PET imaging of [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-c-<sup>D</sup>VAP in tumors showed rapid uptake and sustained retention, with minimal background uptake. Biodistribution studies revealed rapid blood clearance and excretion through the kidneys following a single-compartment reversible metabolic model. In PET imaging, the T/M ratios for A549 tumors (high GRP78 expression), MDA-MB-231 tumors (medium expression), and HepG2 tumors (low expression) at 60 min postintravenous injection were 10.48 ± 1.39, 6.25 ± 0.47, and 3.15 ± 1.15% ID/g, respectively, indicating a positive correlation with GRP78 expression. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NOTA-c-<sup>D</sup>VAP as a PET tracer for imaging GRP78 in tumors. The probe shows promising results in terms of stability, specificity, and tumor targeting. Further research may explore the clinical utility and potential therapeutic applications of this PET tracer for cancer diagnosis.",2024-03-30
38527557,Dual targeting of TIGIT and PD-1 with a novel small molecule for cancer immunotherapy.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have unveiled promising clinical prospects in cancer treatment. Nonetheless, their effectiveness remains restricted, marked by consistently low response rates and affecting only a subset of patients. The co-blockade of TIGIT with PD-1 has exhibited substantial anti-tumor effects. Notably, there is a dearth of reports on small-molecule inhibitors concurrently targeting both TIGIT and PD-1. In this study, we employed Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) to screen our laboratory's existing repository of small molecules. Our findings illuminated Gln(TrT) 's affinity for both TIGIT and PD-1, affirming its potential to effectively inhibit TIGIT/PVR and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways. In vitro co-culture experiments substantiated Gln(TrT)'s proficiency in restoring Jurkat T-cell functionality by blocking both TIGIT/PVR and PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. In the MC38 murine tumor model, Gln(TrT) emerges as a pivotal modulator, promoting the intratumoral infiltration and functional competence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, whether used as a monotherapy or in conjunction with radiotherapy, Gln(TrT) substantially impedes MC38 tumor progression, significantly extending the survival of murine subjects.",2024-03-23
38496440,Comparison of a novel potentiator of CFTR channel activity to ivacaftor in ameliorating mucostasis caused by cigarette smoke in primary human bronchial airway epithelial cells.,"Cystic Fibrosis causing mutations in the gene <i>CFTR</i> , reduce the activity of the CFTR channel protein, and leads to mucus aggregation, airway obstruction and poor lung function. A role for CFTR in the pathogenesis of other muco-obstructive airway diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has been well established. The CFTR modulatory compound, Ivacaftor (VX-770), potentiates channel activity of CFTR and certain CF-causing mutations and has been shown to ameliorate mucus obstruction and improve lung function in people harbouring these CF-causing mutations. A pilot trial of Ivacaftor supported its potential efficacy for the treatment of mucus obstruction in COPD. These findings prompted the search for CFTR potentiators that are more effective in ameliorating cigarette-smoke (CS) induced mucostasis.",2024-03-04
38491556,Derivation of a novel antimicrobial peptide from the Red Sea Brine Pools modified to enhance its anticancer activity against U2OS cells.,"Cancer associated drug resistance is a major cause for cancer aggravation, particularly as conventional therapies have presented limited efficiency, low specificity, resulting in long term deleterious side effects. Peptide based drugs have emerged as potential alternative cancer treatment tools due to their selectivity, ease of design and synthesis, safety profile, and low cost of manufacturing. In this study, we utilized the Red Sea metagenomics database, generated during AUC/KAUST Red Sea microbiome project, to derive a viable anticancer peptide (ACP). We generated a set of peptide hits from our library that shared similar composition to ACPs. A peptide with a homeodomain was selected, modified to improve its anticancer properties, verified to maintain high anticancer properties, and processed for further in-silico prediction of structure and function. The peptide's anticancer properties were then assessed in vitro on osteosarcoma U2OS cells, through cytotoxicity assay (MTT assay), scratch-wound healing assay, apoptosis/necrosis detection assay (Annexin/PI assay), RNA expression analysis of Caspase 3, KI67 and Survivin, and protein expression of PARP1. L929 mouse fibroblasts were also assessed for cytotoxicity treatment. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of the peptide was also examined on E coli and S. aureus, as sample representative species of the human bacterial microbiome, by examining viability, disk diffusion, morphological assessment, and hemolytic analysis. We observed a dose dependent cytotoxic response from peptide treatment of U2OS, with a higher tolerance in L929s. Wound closure was debilitated in cells exposed to the peptide, while annexin fluorescent imaging suggested peptide treatment caused apoptosis as a major mode of cell death. Caspase 3 gene expression was not altered, while KI67 and Survivin were both downregulated in peptide treated cells. Additionally, PARP-1 protein analysis showed a decrease in expression with peptide exposure. The peptide exhibited minimal antimicrobial activity on critical human microbiome species E. coli and S. aureus, with a low inhibition rate, maintenance of structural morphology and minimal hemolytic impact. These findings suggest our novel peptide displayed preliminary ACP properties against U2OS cells, through limited specificity, while triggering apoptosis as a primary mode of cell death and while having minimal impact on the microbiological species E. coli and S. aureus.",2024-03-15

38483654,A Novel Peptide Driving Neurodegeneration Appears Exclusively Linked to the α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor.,"T14, a 14mer peptide, is significantly increased in the pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease brain, and growing evidence implies its pivotal role in neurodegeneration. Here, we explore the subsequent intracellular events following binding of T14 to its target α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Specifically, we test how various experimental manipulations of PC12 cells impact T14-induced functional outcomes. Three preparations were compared: (i) undifferentiated vs. NGF-differentiated cells; (ii) cells transfected with an overexpression of the target α7 nAChR vs. wild type cells; (iii) cells transfected with a mutant α7 nAChR containing a mutation in the G protein-binding cluster, vs. cells transfected with an overexpression of the target α7 nAChR, in three functional assays - calcium influx, cell viability, and acetylcholinesterase release. NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were less sensitive than undifferentiated cells to the concentration-dependent T14 treatment, in all the functional assays performed. The overexpression of α7 nAChR in PC12 cells promoted enhanced calcium influx when compared with the wild type PC12 cells. The α7<sub>345-348 A</sub> mutation effectively abolished the T14-triggered responses across all the readouts observed. The close relationship between T14 and the α7 nAChR was further evidenced in the more physiological preparation of ex vivo rat brain, where T30 increased α7 nAChR mRNA, and finally in human brain post-mortem, where levels of T14 and α7 nAChR exhibited a strong correlation, reflecting the progression of neurodegeneration. Taken together these data would make it hard to account for T14 binding to any other receptor, and thus interception at this binding site would make a very attractive and remarkably specific therapeutic strategy.",2024-03-14
38474222,Antiseptic Functions of CGK012 against HMGB1-Mediated Septic Responses.,"High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a protein with important functions, has been recognized as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of sepsis. One possible mechanism for this is that inhibiting HMGB1 secretion can exert antiseptic effects, which can restore the integrity of the vascular barrier. (7S)-(+)-cyclopentyl carbamic acid 8,8-dimethyl-2-oxo-6,7-dihydro-2H,8H-pyrano[3,2-g]chromen-7-yl-ester (CGK012) is a newly synthesized pyranocoumarin compound that could function as a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, no studies have yet determined the effects of CGK012 on sepsis. We investigated the potential of CGK012 to attenuate the excessive permeability induced by HMGB1 and enhance survival rates in a mouse model of sepsis with reduced HMGB1 levels following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. In both LPS-stimulated human endothelial cells and a mouse model exhibiting septic symptoms due to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), we assessed proinflammatory protein levels and tissue damage biomarkers as indicators of reduced vascular permeability. CGK012 was applied after induction in human endothelial cells exposed to LPS and the CLP-induced mouse model of sepsis. CGK012 effectively mitigated excessive permeability and suppressed HMGB1 release, resulting in improved vascular stability, decreased mortality, and enhanced histological conditions in the mouse model of CLP-induced sepsis.

Here, we report a series of novel peptide-dehydroepiandrosterone hybrids, which would effectively induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and lead to apoptosis with outstanding in vitro and in vivo anti-melanoma effects. The lead compound IId among various steroids conjugated with peptides and pyridines showed effective in vivo activity in B16 xenograft mice: in medium- and high-dose treatment groups (60 and 80 mg/kg), compound IId would significantly inhibit the growth of tumours by 98%-99% compared to the control group, with the highest survival rate as well. Further mechanism studies showed that compound IId would damage the endoplasmic reticulum and upregulate the ERS markers C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which could further regulate caspase and Bcl-2 family proteins and lead to cell apoptosis. The compound IId was also proven to be effective in inhibiting B16 cell migration and invasion.",2024-03-07
38466139,Strategies for the Construction of Multicyclic Phage Display Libraries.,"Peptide therapeutics have gained great interest due to their multiple advantages over small molecule and antibody-based drugs. Peptide drugs are easier to synthesize, have the potential for oral bioavailability, and are large enough to target protein-protein interactions that are undruggable by small molecules. However, two major limitations have made it difficult to develop novel peptide therapeutics not derived from natural products, including the metabolic instability of peptides and the difficulty of reaching antibody-like potencies and specificities. Compared to linear and disulfide-monocyclized peptides, multicyclic peptides can provide increased conformational rigidity, enhanced metabolic stability, and higher potency in inhibiting protein-protein interactions. The identification of novel multicyclic peptide binders can be difficult, however, recent advancements in the construction of multicyclic phage libraries have greatly advanced the process of identifying novel multicyclic peptide binders for therapeutically relevant protein targets. This review will describe the current approaches used to create multicyclic peptide libraries, highlighting the novel chemistries developed and the proof-of-concept work done on validating these libraries against different protein targets.",2024-04-03
38465588,Discovery of Novel PD-L1 Small-Molecular Inhibitors with Potent <i>In Vivo</i> Anti-tumor Immune Activity.,"Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has surfaced as a promising therapeutic target for various cancers due to its pivotal role in facilitating tumor immune evasion. Herein, we report a series of novel small-molecule PD-L1 inhibitors exhibiting remarkable inhibitory activity against the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction (<b>X18</b>: IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.3 nM) and reinstating the suppressive effect of PD-L1 on T cells (<b>X18</b>: EC<sub>50</sub> = 152.8 nM). Crystallographic studies revealed the binding mode of <b>X18</b> and PD-L1. Through a rational prodrug design approach, we have successfully optimized the oral pharmacokinetic properties of <b>X22</b>, effectively addressing the poor oral pharmacokinetic profile of PD-L1 small-molecule inhibitors. Notably, <b>X22</b> demonstrated significant antitumor efficacy in murine models of MC38 and CT26 colon cancer through the upregulation of tumor infiltration and cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells partially. These findings offer promising prospects for the advancement of PD-L1 inhibitors as innovative agents in cancer immunotherapy.",2024-03-11
38462636,Discovery of a novel small molecule as CD47/SIRPα and PD-1/PD-L1 dual inhibitor for cancer immunotherapy.,"Targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer treatment, particularly through the utilization of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) agents such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Despite partial success, the presence of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contributes to an immunosuppressive TME that fosters tumor progression, and diminishes the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Blockade of the CD47/SIRPα pathway has proven to be an effective intervention, that restores macrophage phagocytosis and yields substantial antitumor effects, especially when combined with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Therefore, the identification of small molecules capable of simultaneously blocking CD47/SIRPα and PD-1/PD-L1 interactions has remained imperative.",2024-03-11
38458776,Novel peptide-based oncolytic vaccine for enhancement of adaptive antitumor immune response via co-engagement of innate Fcγ and Fcα receptors.,"Cancer immunotherapy relies on using the immune system to recognize and eradicate cancer cells. Adaptive immunity, which consists of mainly antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, plays a pivotal role in controlling cancer progression. However, innate immunity is a necessary component of the cancer immune response to support an immunomodulatory state, enabling T-cell immunosurveillance.",2024-03-08
38458346,An integrative machine learning model for the identification of tumor T-cell antigens.,"The escalating global incidence of cancer poses significant health challenges, underscoring the need for innovative and more efficacious treatments. Cancer immunotherapy, a promising approach leveraging the body's immune system against cancer, emerges as a compelling solution. Consequently, the identification and characterization of tumor T-cell antigens (TTCAs) have become pivotal for exploration. In this manuscript, we introduce TTCA-IF, an integrative machine learning-based framework designed for TTCAs identification. TTCA-IF employs ten feature encoding types in conjunction with five conventional machine learning classifiers. To establish a robust foundation, these classifiers are trained, resulting in the creation of 150 baseline models. The outputs from these baseline models are then fed back into the five classifiers, generating their respective meta-models. Through an ensemble approach, the five meta-models are seamlessly integrated to yield the final predictive model, the TTCA-IF model. Our proposed model, TTCA-IF, surpasses both baseline models and existing predictors in performance. In a comparative analysis involving nine novel peptide sequences, TTCA-IF demonstrated exceptional accuracy by correctly identifying 8 out of 9 peptides as TTCAs. As a tool for screening and pinpointing potential TTCAs, we anticipate TTCA-IF to be invaluable in advancing cancer immunotherapy.",2024-03-06
38431094,Peptide targeting improves the delivery and therapeutic index of glucocorticoids to treat rheumatoid arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation in the joints. Glucocorticoid drugs are used clinically to manage RA symptoms, while their dosage and duration need to be tightly controlled due to severe adverse effects. Using dexamethasone (DEX) as a model drug, we explored here whether peptide-guided delivery could increase the safety and therapeutic index of glucocorticoids for RA treatment. Using multiple murine RA models such as collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), we found that CRV, a macrophage-targeting peptide, can selectively home to the inflammatory synovium of RA joints upon intravenous injection. The expression of the CRV receptor, retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB), was also elevated in the inflammatory synovium, likely being the basis of CRV targeting. CRV-conjugated DEX increased the accumulation of DEX in the inflamed synovium but not in healthy organs of CIA mice. Therefore, CRV-DEX demonstrated a stronger efficacy to suppress synovial inflammation and alleviate cartilage/bone destruction. Meanwhile, CRV conjugation reduced immune-related adverse effects of DEX even after a long-term use. Last, we found that RXRB expression was significantly elevated in human patient samples, demonstrating the potential of clinical translation. Taken together, we provide a novel, peptide-targeted strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids for RA treatment.",2024-03-05
38431093,Smart exosomes enhance PDAC targeted therapy.,"Exosomes continue to attract interest as a promising nanocarrier drug delivery technology. They are naturally derived nanoscale extracellular vesicles with innate properties well suited to shuttle proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. Nonetheless, their clinical utility is currently limited by several major challenges, such as their inability to target tumor cells and a high proportion of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) of the liver and spleen. To overcome these limitations, we developed ""Smart Exosomes"" that co-display RGD and CD47<sup>p110-130</sup> through CD9 engineering (Exo<sup>Smart</sup>). The resultant Exo<sup>Smart</sup> demonstrates enhanced binding capacity to αvβ3 on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, resulting in amplified cellular uptake in in vitro and in vivo models and increased chemotherapeutic efficacies. Simultaneously, Exo<sup>Smart</sup> significantly reduced liver and spleen clearance of exosomes by inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis via CD47<sup>p110-130</sup> interaction with signal regulatory proteins (SIRPα) on macrophages. These studies demonstrate that an engineered exosome drug delivery system increases PDAC therapeutic efficacy by enhancing active PDAC targeting and prolonging circulation times, and their findings hold tremendous translational potential for cancer therapy while providing a concrete foundation for future work utilizing novel peptide-engineered exosome strategies.",2024-03-07
38397115,Identification of Novel Non-Nucleoside Inhibitors of Zika Virus NS5 Protein Targeting MTase Activity.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense single-stranded virus member of the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family. Among other arboviruses, ZIKV can cause neurological disorders such as Guillain Barré syndrome, and it can have congenital neurological manifestations and affect fertility. ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is essential for viral replication and limiting host immune detection. Herein, we performed virtual screening to identify novel small-molecule inhibitors of the ZIKV NS5 methyltransferase (MTase) domain. Compounds were tested against the MTases of both ZIKV and DENV, demonstrating good inhibitory activities against ZIKV MTase. Extensive molecular dynamic studies conducted on the series led us to identify other derivatives with improved activity against the MTase and limiting ZIKV infection with an increased selectivity index. Preliminary pharmacokinetic parameters have been determined, revealing excellent stability over time. Preliminary in vivo toxicity studies demonstrated that the hit compound <b>17</b> is well tolerated after acute administration. Our results provide the basis for further optimization studies on novel non-nucleoside MTase inhibitors.",2024-02-19

38385004,The novel peptide LCGM-10 attenuates metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 activity and demonstrates behavioral effects in animal models.,"We employed a structural bioinformatics approach to develop novel peptides with predicted affinity to the binding site for negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Primary screening in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) revealed a stimulatory effect of two peptides, LCGM-10 and LCGM-15. Target validation studies using calcium ion flux imaging and a luciferase reporter assay confirmed mGluR5 as the target. LCGM-10 showed greater potency than LCGM-15; it was comparable to that of the mGluR5 NAM 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP). Rodent behavioral screening in the open field and elevated plus maze revealed increased locomotor activity in both tests after acute LCGM-10 treatment, supported by further analysis of home cage spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA). The stimulating effect of a single LCGM-10 administration on SLA was evident up to 60 min after administration and was not accompanied by hypokinetic rebound observed for caffeine. According to our results, LCGM-10 has therapeutic potential to treat hypo- and dyskinesias of various etiologies. Further investigation of LCGM-10 effects in the delay discounting model of impulsive choice in rats revealed reduced trait impulsivity after single and chronic administrations, suggesting potential implication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and addictions.",2024-02-07
38384299,Neuroprotective effects of a novel peptide through the Rho-integrin-Tie2 and PI3K/Akt pathways in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model.,"<b>Purpose:</b> The interaction between inflammatory cells and integrin in the endothelium plays a key role during infiltration. Previous evidence has shown that synthetic C16 peptide selectively binds to integrins αvβ3 and α5β1 and exhibits a neuroprotective effect. It has also been reported to inhibit the differentiation of microglia into the M1 (pro-inflammatory) phenotype while promoting its differentiation to the M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotype. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of action of the C16 peptide in multiple sclerosis using a rodent model. <b>Methods:</b> Molecular, morphological, and neurophysiological assays were used to investigate the neuroprotective effects of C16 peptide and related signaling pathways in a model of EAE. <b>Results:</b> The results showed that C16 significantly improved the clinical score and cortical somatosensory/motor evoked potential. It also alleviated inflammatory responses, including microglial activation and leukocyte infiltration, relieved the impairment of the brain blood barrier and edema, and reduced neuronal apoptosis, axonal loss, and demyelination induced by EAE. The C16 peptide increased the expressions of pTie-2 and Tie-2, integrin αvβ3, and α5β1 and activated the PI3K/Akt signal pathway but decreased the expression of Rho. Co-treatment of C16 with Tie-2 inhibitor and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 attenuated these effects of C16. <b>Conclusion:</b> The C16 peptide demonstrated neuroprotection in the EAE model through the integrin, Tie-2, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, and it could be a potential strategy for treating inflammation-related diseases in the central nervous system.",2024-02-06
38377719,A modified natural small molecule inhibits triple-negative breast cancer growth by interacting with Tubb3.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a malignant tumor without specific therapeutic targets and a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is currently the first-line therapeutic option for TNBC. However, due to the heterogeneity of TNBC, not all of TNBC patients are responsive to chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, the demand for new targeted agents is critical. β-tubulin isotype III (Tubb3) is a prognostic factor associated with cancer progression, including breast cancer, and targeting Tubb3 may lead to improve TNBC disease control. Shikonin, the active compound in the roots of Lithospermun erythrorhizon suppresses the growth of various types of tumors, and its efficacy can be improved by altering its chemical structure.",2023-05-19
38375035,Multiple roles of baicalin and baicalein in the regulation of colorectal cancer.,"The prevalence of colorectal cancer is increasing worldwide, and despite advances in treatment, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains in the top three for mortality due to several issues, including drug resistance and low efficiency. There is increasing evidence that baicalin and baicalein, novel small molecule inhibitor extracts of the Chinese herb Scutellaria baicalensis, have better anti-colorectal cancer effects and are less likely to induce drug resistance in cancer cells. The present review article explains the anti-proliferative properties of baicalin and baicalein in the context of against CRC. Additionally, it explores the underlying mechanisms by which these compounds modulate diverse signaling pathways associated with apoptosis, cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and tumor microenvironment. Moreover, this review article highlights the inhibitory effect of colorectal inflammatory-cancer transformation and the near-term therapeutic strategy of using them as adjuvant agents in chemotherapy.",2024-02-05

Accumulating evidence suggests that circRNAs have been identified as pivotal mediators in cancers. However, the role of circRNAs in ccRCC progression remains elusive.",2024-02-15
38356220,"Structure-Guided Discovery of PD-1/PD-L1 Interaction Inhibitors: Peptide Design, Screening, and Optimization via Computation-Aided Phage Display Engineering.","Cancer immunotherapy harnesses the immune system to combat tumors and has emerged as a major cancer treatment modality. The PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint modulates interactions between tumor cells and T cells and has been extensively targeted in cancer immunotherapy. However, the monoclonal antibodies known to target this immune checkpoint have considerable side effects, and novel PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are therefore required. Herein, a peptide inhibitor to disrupt PD-1/PD-L1 interactions was designed through structure-driven phage display engineering coupled to computational modification and optimization. <b>BetaPb</b>, a novel peptide library constructed by using the known structure of PD-1/PD-L, was used to develop inhibitors against the immune checkpoint, and specific peptides with high affinity toward PD-1 were screened through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence, and biolayer interferometry. A potential inhibitor, <b>B8</b>, was preliminarily screened through biopanning. The binding affinity of <b>B8</b> toward PD-1 was confirmed through computation-aided optimization. Assessment of <b>B8</b> variants (<b>B8.1</b>, <b>B8.2</b>, <b>B8.3</b>, <b>B8.4</b>, and <b>B8.5</b>) demonstrated their attenuation of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. <b>B8.4</b> exhibited the strongest attenuation efficiency at a half-maximal effective concentration of 0.1 μM and the strongest binding affinity to PD-1 (equilibrium dissociation constant = 0.1 μM). <b>B8.4</b> outperformed the known PD-1/PD-L1 interaction inhibitor PL120131 in disrupting PD-1/PD-L1 interactions, revealing that <b>B8.4</b> has remarkable potential for modification to yield an antitumor agent. This study provides valuable information for the future development of peptide-based drugs, therapeutics, and immunotherapies for cancer.",2024-02-14
38354956,"Ebselen and TPI-1, as RecG helicase inhibitors, potently enhance the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to DNA damage agents.","Holliday junction (HJ) is a four-way structured DNA intermediate in processes of homologous recombination and DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair. In bacteria, HJs are processed via either the RuvABC or RecG-dependent pathways. In addition, RecG also plays a critical role in the reactivation of stalled replication forks, making it an attractive target for antibacterial drug development. Here, we conducted a high-throughput screening targeting the RecG helicase from a common opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). From a library containing 7920 compounds, we identified Ebselen and TPI-1 (2',5'-Dichloro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,5-dione) as two potent PaRecG inhibitors, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.31 ± 0.02 μM and 1.16 ± 0.06 μM, respectively. Further biochemical analyses suggested that both Ebselen and TPI-1 inhibited the ATPase activity of PaRecG, and hindered its binding to HJ DNA with high selectivity. These compounds, when combined with our previously reported RuvAB inhibitors, resulted in more severe DNA repair defects than the individual treatment, and potently enhanced the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to the DNA damage agents. This work reports novel small molecule inhibitors of RecG, offering valuable chemical tools for advancing our understanding of RecG's function and mechanism. Additionally, these inhibitors might be further developed as promising antibacterial agents in the fight against P. aeruginosa infections.",2024-02-12
38349136,Update on gepants for the treatment of chronic migraine.,"Chronic migraine (CM) is a profoundly debilitating condition that has detrimental clinical and social outcomes. Over the past two decades, novel small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, known as gepants, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed, ushering in a new era of migraine-specific treatment. In this review, we discuss the literature investigating the role of gepants for the treatment of CM. Numerous completed and ongoing clinical studies have conclusively demonstrated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of several gepants for the acute treatment of migraine. However, preventive trials involving gepants have focused on patients with episodic migraine, with atogepant being the only gepant approved for CM prevention by the US Food and Drug Administration at the time of writing. Although some preliminary positive results have been reported, further research is still required to achieve additional advancements in the future. In summary, the effectiveness of gepants for treating individuals with CM are highly expected. This review highlights the development and current progress of gepants for the treatment of CM, focusing both on their role as acute abortive agents and preventive measures and on their concomitant use with other antimigraine medications, such as CGRP mAbs or triptans.",2024-02-13
38345562,Netrin-1 mitigates acute lung injury by preventing the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB (TLR4/NF-κB) signaling.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is one of the most common high-risk diseases associated with a high mortality rate and is still a challenge to treat effectively. Netrin-1 (NT-1) is a novel peptide with a wide range of biological functions, however, its effects on ALI have not been reported before. In this study, an ALI model was constructed using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated with NT-1. Pulmonary function and lung wet to dry weight ratio (W/D) were detected. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2) were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the levels of NT-1 were reduced in the LPS-induced ALI mice model. Administration of NT-1 improved histopathological changes of lung tissues and lung function in LPS-challenged ALI mice. We also report that NT-1 decreased Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and ameliorated pulmonary edema. Additionally, treatment with NT-1 reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-8, IL-1β, and CXCL2 in lung tissues of LPS-challenged ALI mice. Importantly, NT-1 reduced cell count in BALF and mitigated oxidative stress (OS) by reducing the levels of MDA and increasing the levels of GSH. Mechanistically, it is shown that NT-1 reduced the levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and prevented nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65. Our findings indicate that NT-1 is a promising agent for the treatment of ALI through inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB signaling.",2024-02-09

38328202,Increased interaction between connexin43 and microtubules is critical for glioblastoma stem-like cell maintenance and tumorigenicity.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary tumor of the central nervous system. One major challenge in GBM treatment is the resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy observed in subpopulations of cancer cells, including GBM stem-like cells (GSCs). These cells hold the ability to self-renew or differentiate following treatment, participating in tumor recurrence. The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) has complex roles in oncogenesis and we have previously demonstrated an association between Cx43 and GBM chemotherapy resistance. Here, we report, for the first time, increased direct interaction between non-junctional Cx43 with microtubules in the cytoplasm of GSCs. We hypothesize that non-junctional Cx43/microtubule complexing is critical for GSC maintenance and survival and sought to specifically disrupt this interaction while maintaining other Cx43 functions, such as gap junction formation. Using a Cx43 mimetic peptide of the carboxyl terminal tubulin-binding domain of Cx43 (JM2), we successfully ablated Cx43 interaction with microtubules in GSCs. Importantly, administration of JM2 significantly decreased GSC survival <i>in vitro</i> , and limited GSC-derived tumor growth <i>in vivo</i> . Together, these results identify JM2 as a novel peptide drug to ablate GSCs in GBM treatment.",2024-01-27
38328167,Highly specific intracellular ubiquitination of a small molecule.,"Ubiquitin is a small, highly conserved protein that acts as a posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. Ubiquitination of proteins frequently serves as a degradation signal, marking them for disposal by the proteasome. Here, we report a novel small molecule from a diversity-oriented synthesis library, BRD1732, that is directly ubiquitinated in cells, resulting in dramatic accumulation of inactive ubiquitin monomers and polyubiquitin chains causing broad inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination of BRD1732 and its associated cytotoxicity are stereospecific and dependent upon two homologous E3 ubiquitin ligases, RNF19A and RNF19B. Our finding opens the possibility for indirect ubiquitination of a target through a ubiquitinated bifunctional small molecule, and more broadly raises the potential for posttranslational modification <i>in trans</i>.",2024-01-28
38323288,Novel dual action PARP and microtubule polymerization inhibitor AMXI-5001 powerfully inhibits growth of esophageal carcinoma both alone and in combination with radiotherapy.,"Esophageal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths globally with an incidence that is concentrated in specific hot spots in Eastern Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Africa, and South America. 10-year overall survival for patients treated with standard of care chemoradiation followed by surgical resection is below 40% highlighting the need for novel therapeutics to treat this disease. We assessed the effect of AMXI-5001, a novel small molecule poly ADP-Ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor and microtubule polymerization inhibitor on tumor growth inhibition in both <i>in-vitro</i> and <i>in-vivo</i> murine models. We found that AMXI-5001 was the most potent growth inhibitor of 8 out of 9 different esophageal carcinoma cell lines compared to other clinically available PARP inhibitors, Olaparib, Niraparib, Rucaparib, and Talazoparib. We then confirmed the previously described mechanism of action of AMXI-5001 as a PARP-inhibitor and microtubule polymerization inhibitor using both a PARP trapping assay and immunofluorescence. To further assess AMXI-5001's potential as a therapeutic for esophageal carcinoma we evaluated the effect of AMXI-5001 in combination with standard chemotherapy agents, Cisplatin and 5 Fluorouracil. We showed that AMXI-5001 synergistically inhibits growth in KYSE-70, a squamous esophageal cell line in combination with these drugs. In addition, we found that AMXI-5001 was an effective radiosensitizer, and squamous esophageal carcinoma cell lines treated 24 hours prior to external beam radiation showed significantly more growth inhibition compared to controls. Finally, we assessed the effect of AMXI-5001 monotherapy and in combination with radiotherapy in a xenograft mouse model implanted with subcutaneous KYSE-70 cells. Compared to vehicle control, and those treated with either AMXI-5001 alone or radiation alone, mice treated with both AMXI-5001 and radiation had significant tumor response. In conclusion, AMXI-5001 is an orally bioavailable dual-action PARP and microtubule polymerization inhibitor that holds promise in the treatment of esophageal carcinoma.",2024-01-15
38299600,The <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> antiviral effects of IGF1R inhibitors against respiratory syncytial virus infection.,"The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) was recognized as a pivotal receptor that facilitated the cellular entry of RSV. Small molecule inhibitors designed to target IGF1R exhibited potential as potent antiviral agents. Through virtual screening, we conducted a screening process involving small molecule compounds derived from natural products, aiming to target the IGF1R protein against respiratory syncytial virus infection. The molecular dynamics simulation analysis showed that tannic acid and daptomycin interacted with the IGF1R. The experimental results <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> showed that tannic acid and daptomycin had anti-RSV infection potential through reducing viral loads, inflammation, airway resistance and protecting alveolar integrity. The CC50 values of tannic acid and daptomycin were 6 nM and 0.45 μM, respectively. Novel small-molecule inhibitors targeting the IGF1R, tannic acid and daptomycin, may be effective anti-RSV therapy agents. This study may in future broaden the arsenal of therapeutics for use against RSV infection and lead to more effective care against the virus.",2024-02-01
38291578,PET Imaging of Peptide Probe Al[<sup>18</sup>F]F-NOTA-PCP1 for Monitoring the Engagement of PD-L1 Antibodies in Tumors.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a powerful treatment modality for various types of cancer. The effectiveness of ICIs is intimately connected to the binding status of antibodies to receptors. However, validated means to accurately evaluate target specificity and predict antibody efficacy <i>in vivo</i> are lacking. A novel peptide-based probe called Al[<sup>18</sup>F]F-NOTA-PCP1 was developed and validated for its specificity to PD-L1 in A549, U87MG, GL261, and GL261-iPDL1 cell lines, as well as in xenograft models. Then the probe was used in PET/CT scans to determine the binding status of PD-L1 antibodies (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab) in U87MG xenograft model mice. Moreover, Al[<sup>18</sup>F]F-NOTA-PCP1 was used to evaluate the impact of different treatment times and doses. Al[<sup>18</sup>F]F-NOTA-PCP1 PET/CT can be used to evaluate the interaction between PD-L1 and antibodies to determine the effectiveness of immunotherapy. By quantifying target engagement, the probe has the potential to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy and optimize the dose and treatment schedules for PD-L1 immunotherapy. This imaging agent could be a valuable tool in guiding personalized treatment strategies and improving cancer patient outcomes.",2024-01-30
38289472,A novel aminopeptidase N/CD13 inhibitor selectively targets an endothelial form of CD13 after coupling to proteins.,"Aminopeptidase N/CD13, a membrane-bound enzyme upregulated in tumor vasculature and involved in angiogenesis, can be used as a receptor for the targeted delivery of drugs to tumors through ligand-directed targeting approaches. We describe a novel peptide ligand (VGCARRYCS, called ""G4"") that recognizes CD13 with high affinity and selectivity. Enzymological and computational studies showed that G4 is a competitive inhibitor that binds to the catalytic pocket of CD13 through its N-terminal region. Fusing the peptide C-terminus to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) or coupling it to a biotin/avidin complex causes loss of binding and inhibitory activity against different forms of CD13, including natural or recombinant ectoenzyme and a membrane form expressed by HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (likely due to steric hindrance), but not binding to a membrane form of CD13 expressed by endothelial cells (ECs). Furthermore, G4-TNF systemically administered to tumor-bearing mice exerted anticancer effects through a CD13-targeting mechanism, indicating the presence of a CD13 form in tumor vessels with an accessible binding site. Biochemical studies showed that most CD13 molecules expressed on the surface of ECs are catalytically inactive. Other functional assays showed that these molecules can promote endothelial cell adhesion to plates coated with G4-avidin complexes, suggesting that the endothelial form of CD13 can exert catalytically independent biological functions. In conclusion, ECs express a catalytically inactive form of CD13 characterized by an accessible conformation that can be selectively targeted by G4-protein conjugates. This form of CD13 may represent a specific target receptor for ligand-directed targeted delivery of therapeutics to tumors.",2024-01-30
38283225,Discovery of a dual-acting inhibitor of interleukin-1β and STATs for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Currently, a significant proportion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients fail to respond to conventional drug therapy such as immunosuppressants and biologic agents. Interference with the JAK/STAT pathway and blocking of IL-1 signaling are two promising therapeutic strategies for these unresponsive IBD patients. This work describes the discovery of an inhibitor 10v that not only blocks NLRP3 and AIM-2 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β signaling, but also reduces the expression of STAT1 and STAT5 in the JAK/STAT pathway. Importantly, 10v exhibits a significant anti-IL-1β effect and decreases the levels of STAT1 and STAT5 in a mouse model of colitis. As a result, a novel small molecule is identified with a dual inhibitory capacity towards both inflammasomes/IL-1β and STAT pathways, which supports further exploration of the therapeutic potential for IBD patients that do not respond to current drug therapy.",2023-11-09
38281321,Laminin mimetic angiogenic and collagen peptide hydrogel for enhance dermal wound healing.,"Laminins are essential in basement membrane architecture and critical in re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. These processes and collagen deposition are vital in skin wound healing. The role of angiogenic peptides in accelerating the wound-healing process has been known. The bioactive peptides could be a potential approach due to their similar effects as growth factors and inherent biocompatible and biodegradable nature with lower cost. They can also recognize ligand-receptor interaction and mimic the extracellular matrix. Here, we report novel angiogenic DYVRLAI, CDYVRLAI, angiogenic-collagen PGPIKVAV, and Ac-PGPIKVAV peptides conjugated sodium carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel, which was designed from laminin. The designed peptide exhibits a better binding with the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrins and CXCR2 receptor, indicating their angiogenic and collagen binding efficiency. The peptides were evaluated to stimulate wound healing in full-thickness excision wounds in normal and diabetic mice (type II). They demonstrated their efficacy in terms of angiogenesis (CD31), re-epithelialization through regeneration of the epidermis (H&E), and collagen deposition (MT). The synthesized peptide hydrogel (DYVRLAI and CDYVRLAI) showed enhanced wound contraction up to 10.1 % and 12.3 % on day 7<sup>th</sup> compared to standard becaplermin gel (49 %) in a normal wound model. The encouraging results were also observed with the diabetic model, where these peptides showed a significant decrease of 5.20 and 5.17 % in wound size on day 10<sup>th</sup> compared to the commercial gel (9.27 %). These outcomes signify that the modified angiogenic peptide is a cost effective, novel peptide motif to promote dermal wound healing in both models.",2024-01-17
38278080,"Novel small molecule inhibitors targeting renal cell carcinoma: Status, challenges, future directions.","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common renal malignancy with a rapidly increasing morbidity and mortality rate gradually. RCC has a high mortality rate and an extremely poor prognosis. Despite numerous treatment strategies, RCC is resistant to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In addition, the limited clinical efficacy and inevitable resistance of multiple agents suggest an unmet clinical need. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel anti-RCC candidates. Nowadays many promising results have been achieved with the development of novel small molecule inhibitors against RCC. This paper reviews the recent research progress of novel small molecule inhibitors targeting RCC. It is focusing on the structural optimization process and conformational relationships of small molecule inhibitors, as well as the potential mechanisms and anticancer activities for the treatment of RCC. To provide a theoretical basis for promoting the clinical translation of novel small molecule inhibitors, we discussed their application prospects and future development directions. It could be capable of improving the clinical efficacy of RCC and improving the therapy resistance for RCC.",2024-01-17

38260445,Enabling Systemic Identification and Functionality Profiling for Cdc42 Homeostatic Modulators.,"Homeostatic modulation is pivotal in modern therapeutics. However, the discovery of bioactive materials to achieve this functionality is often random and unpredictive. Here, we enabled a systemic identification and functional classification of chemicals that elicit homeostatic modulation of signaling through Cdc42, a classical small GTPase of Ras superfamily. Rationally designed for high throughput screening, the capture of homeostatic modulators (HMs) along with molecular re-docking uncovered at least five functionally distinct classes of small molecules. This enabling led to partial agonists, hormetic agonists, <i>bona fide</i> activators and inhibitors, and ligand-enhanced agonists. Novel HMs exerted striking functionality in bradykinin-Cdc42 activation of actin remodelingand modified Alzheimer's disease-like behavior in mouse model. This concurrent computer-aided and experimentally empowered HM profiling highlights a model path for predicting HM landscape.",2024-01-08
38260358,Activation of Polycystin-1 Signaling by Binding of Stalk-derived Peptide Agonists.,"Polycystin-1 (PC1) is the membrane protein product of the PKD1 gene whose mutation is responsible for 85% of the cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). ADPKD is primarily characterized by the formation of renal cysts and potential kidney failure. PC1 is an atypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) consisting of 11 transmembrane helices and an autocatalytic GAIN domain that cleaves PC1 into extracellular N-terminal (NTF) and membrane-embedded C-terminal (CTF) fragments. Recently, signaling activation of the PC1 CTF was shown to be regulated by a stalk tethered agonist (TA), a distinct mechanism observed in the adhesion GPCR family. A novel allosteric activation pathway was elucidated for the PC1 CTF through a combination of Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD), mutagenesis and cellular signaling experiments. Here, we show that synthetic, soluble peptides with 7 to 21 residues derived from the stalk TA, in particular, peptides including the first 9 residues (p9), 17 residues (p17) and 21 residues (p21) exhibited the ability to re-activate signaling by a stalkless PC1 CTF mutant in cellular assays. To reveal molecular mechanisms of stalk peptide-mediated signaling activation, we have applied a novel Peptide GaMD (Pep-GaMD) algorithm to elucidate binding conformations of selected stalk peptide agonists p9, p17 and p21 to the stalkless PC1 CTF. The simulations revealed multiple specific binding regions of the stalk peptide agonists to the PC1 protein including an ""intermediate"" bound yet inactive state. Our Pep-GaMD simulation findings were consistent with the cellular assay experimental data. Binding of peptide agonists to the TOP domain of PC1 induced close TOP-putative pore loop interactions, a characteristic feature of the PC1 CTF signaling activation mechanism. Using sequence covariation analysis of PC1 homologs, we further showed that the peptide binding regions were consistent with covarying residue pairs identified between the TOP domain and the stalk TA. Therefore, structural dynamic insights into the mechanisms of PC1 activation by stalk-derived peptide agonists have enabled an in-depth understanding of PC1 signaling. They will form a foundation for development of PC1 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of ADPKD.",2024-07-10
38254786,Gα<sub>i</sub>2 Protein Inhibition Blocks Chemotherapy- and Anti-Androgen-Induced Prostate Cancer Cell Migration.,"We have previously shown that heterotrimeric G-protein subunit alphai2 (Gα<sub>i</sub>2) is essential for cell migration and invasion in prostate, ovarian and breast cancer cells, and novel small molecule inhibitors targeting Gα<sub>i</sub>2 block its effects on migratory and invasive behavior. In this study, we have identified potent, metabolically stable, second generation Gα<sub>i</sub>2 inhibitors which inhibit cell migration in prostate cancer cells. Recent studies have shown that chemotherapy can induce the cancer cells to migrate to distant sites to form metastases. In the present study, we determined the effects of taxanes (docetaxel), anti-androgens (enzalutamide and bicalutamide) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (SAHA and SBI-I-19) on cell migration in prostate cancer cells. All treatments induced cell migration, and simultaneous treatments with new Gα<sub>i</sub>2 inhibitors blocked their effects on cell migration. We concluded that a combination treatment of Gα<sub>i</sub>2 inhibitors and chemotherapy could blunt the capability of cancer cells to migrate and form metastases.",2024-01-10
38251250,Diversity and Evolutionary Analysis of Venom Insulin Derived from Cone Snails.,"Cone snails possess a diverse array of novel peptide toxins, which selectively target ion channels and receptors in the nervous and cardiovascular systems. These numerous novel peptide toxins are a valuable resource for future marine drug development. In this review, we compared and analyzed the sequence diversity, three-dimensional structural variations, and evolutionary aspects of venom insulin derived from different cone snail species. The comparative analysis reveals that there are significant variations in the sequences and three-dimensional structures of venom insulins from cone snails with different feeding habits. Notably, the venom insulin of some piscivorous cone snails exhibits a greater similarity to humans and zebrafish insulins. It is important to emphasize that these venom insulins play a crucial role in the predatory strategies of these cone snails. Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to trace the lineage of venom insulin sequences, shedding light on the evolutionary interconnections among cone snails with diverse diets.",2024-01-09
38248669,"Antioxidant, Antibacterial Properties of Novel Peptide CP by Enzymatic Hydrolysis of <i>Chromis notata</i> By-Products and Its Efficacy on Atopic Dermatitis.","This study investigated the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-atopic dermatitis (AD) effects of a novel peptide (CP) derived from a <i>Chromis notata</i> by-product hydrolysate. Alcalase, Flavourzyme, Neutrase, and Protamex enzymes were used to hydrolyze the <i>C. notata</i> by-product protein, and the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical-scavenging activity was measured. Alcalase hydrolysate exhibited the highest ABTS radical-scavenging activity, leading to the selection of Alcalase for further purification. The CHAO-1-I fraction, with the highest ABTS activity, was isolated and further purified, resulting in the identification of the peptide CP with the amino acid sequence Ala-Gln-Val-Met-Lys-Leu-Pro-His-Arg-Met-Gln-His-Ser-Gln-Ser. CP demonstrated antimicrobial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, inhibiting its growth. In a 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD-like skin model in mice, CP significantly alleviated skin lesions, reduced epidermal and dermal thickness, and inhibited mast cell infiltration. Moreover, CP suppressed the elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the plasma of DNCB-induced mice. These findings highlight the potential of CP as a therapeutic agent for AD and suggest a novel application of this <i>C. notata</i> by-product in the fish processing industry.",2024-01-12
38247578,"Anti-Salmonella Activity of a Novel Peptide, KGGDLGLFEPTL, Derived from Egg Yolk Hydrolysate.","The present study aimed to characterize the mode of action of a novel antimicrobial peptide isolated from egg yolk hydrolysate. The EYHp6, KGGDLGLFEPTL, exhibited inhibition against <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium TISTR 292 and <i>S. enterica</i> serovar Enteritidis DMST 15679 with a MIC value of 2 mM. In contrast, <i>S</i>. <i>enterica</i> serovar Newport ATCC 6962 and other strains of Typhimurium and Enteritidis were inhibited at 4 mM. EYHp6 increased the cell membrane permeability of <i>S</i>. Typhimurium TISTR 292, leading to DNA leakage. Membrane integrity determined by propidium iodide and SYTO9 staining visualized by confocal microscopy demonstrated that EYHp6 at 1 × MIC induced disruption of cell membranes. Electron microscopy revealed that treatment of <i>S.</i> Typhimurium with EYHp6 led to damage to the cell membrane, causing the leakage of intracellular contents. Synchrotron-based Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that EYHp6 killed <i>S.</i> Typhimurium by targeting fatty acids and nucleic acids in the cell membrane. The peptide did not show hemolytic activity up to 4 mM. These findings suggest that EYHp6 could be a promising antibacterial agent for controlling the growth of <i>S</i>. <i>enterica</i>.",2023-12-24
38246445,Peptide-ligand conjugate based immunotherapeutic approach for targeted dismissal of non-structural protein 1 of dengue virus: A novel therapeutic solution for mild and severe dengue infections.,"Dengue virus infection has significantly increased, with reported cases soaring from 505,430 in 2000 to 2,809,818 in 2022, emphasizing the need for effective treatments. Among the eleven structural and non-structural proteins of DENV, Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has emerged as a promising target due to its diverse role in modulating the immune response, inducing vascular leakage, and facilitating viral replication and assembly. Monoclonal antibodies are the sole therapeutics to target NS1, but concerns about their cross-reactivity persist. Given these concerns, our study focuses on designing a novel Peptide Ligand Conjugate (PLC) as a potential alternative immunotherapeutic agent against NS1. This PLC aims to mediate the immune elimination of soluble NS1 and NS1-presenting DENV-infected host cells by pre-existing vaccine-induced immunity. By employing the High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS) method, QikProp analysis, and Molecular Dynamics studies, we identified three hits from Asinex Biodesigned Ligands out of 220,177 compounds that show strong binding affinity towards the monoclonal binding site of NS1 protein. After a rigorous analysis of physicochemical characteristics, antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity using various servers, we selected two peptides: the minimum epitopic region of the Diphtheria and Tetanus toxins as the peptide components of the PLCs. A non-cleavable, non-reactive oxime linker connected the ligand with the peptide through oxime and amide bonds. DPT vaccine is widely used in dengue-endemic countries, and it has been reported that antibodies titer against MER of Diphtheria toxin and Tetanus toxins persist lifelong in DPT-vaccinated people. Therefore, once the rationally designed PLCs bind to NS1 through the ligands, the peptide will induce an immune response against NS1 by triggering pre-existing DPT antibodies and activating memory cells. This orchestrated immune response will destroy soluble NS1 and NS1-expressing DENV-infected cells, thereby reducing the illness of severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and the DENV infection, respectively. Given the increasing demand for new therapeutics for DENV treatment, further investigation into this novel immune-therapeutic strategy may offer a new avenue for treating mild and severe dengue infections.",2024-01-20
38241936,Introduction of a fatty acid chain modification to prolong circulatory half-life of a radioligand towards glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor.,"The beneficial role of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) in weight control and maintaining glucose levels has led to the development of several multi-agonistic peptide drug candidates, targeting GIPR and glucagon like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) and/or the glucagon receptor (GCGR). The in vivo quantification of target occupancy by these drugs would accelerate the development of new drug candidates. The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel peptide (GIP1234), based on previously reported ligand DOTA-GIP-C803, modified with a fatty acid moiety to prolong its blood circulation. It would allow higher target tissue exposure and consequently improved peptide uptake as well as in vivo PET imaging and quantification of GIPR occupancy by novel drugs of interest.",2024-01-10
38240950,Design and investigation of interactions of novel peptide conjugates of purine and pyrimidine derivatives with EGFR and its mutant T790M/L858R: an in silico and laboratory study.,"Peptide-based therapeutics have been gaining attention due to their ability to actively target tumor cells. Additionally, several varieties of nucleotide derivatives have been developed to reduce cell proliferation and induce apoptosis of tumor cells. In this work, we have developed novel peptide conjugates with newly designed purine analogs and pyrimidine derivatives and explored the binding interactions with the kinase domain of wild-type EGFR and its mutant EGFR [L858R/ T790M] which are known to be over-expressed in tumor cells. The peptides explored included WNWKV (derived from sea cucumber) and LARFFS, which in previous work was predicted to bind to Domain I of EGFR. Computational studies conducted to explore binding interactions include molecular docking studies, molecular dynamics simulations and MMGBSA to investigate the binding abilities and stability of the complexes. The results indicate that conjugation enhanced binding capabilities, particularly for the WNWKV conjugates. MMGBSA analysis revealed nearly twofold higher binding toward the T790M/L858R double mutant receptor. Several conjugates were shown to have strong and stable binding with both wild-type and mutant EGFR. As a proof of concept, we synthesized pyrimidine conjugates with both peptides and determined the KD values using SPR analysis. The results corroborated with the computational analyses. Additionally, cell viability and apoptosis studies with lung cancer cells expressing the wild-type and double mutant proteins revealed that the WNWKV conjugate showed greater potency than the LARFFS conjugate, while LARFFS peptide alone showed poor binding to the kinase domain. Thus, we have designed peptide conjugates that show potential for further laboratory studies for developing therapeutics for targeting the EGFR receptor and its mutant T790M/L858R.",2024-01-19
38237681,Revealing the mechanism of action of a first-in-class covalent inhibitor of KRASG12C (ON) and other functional properties of oncogenic KRAS by <sup>31</sup>P NMR.,"Individual oncogenic KRAS mutants confer distinct differences in biochemical properties and signaling for reasons that are not well understood. KRAS activity is closely coupled to protein dynamics and is regulated through two interconverting conformations: state 1 (inactive, effector binding deficient) and state 2 (active, effector binding enabled). Here, we use <sup>31</sup>P NMR to delineate the differences in state 1 and state 2 populations present in WT and common KRAS oncogenic mutants (G12C, G12D, G12V, G13D, and Q61L) bound to its natural substrate GTP or a commonly used nonhydrolyzable analog GppNHp (guanosine-5'-[(β,γ)-imido] triphosphate). Our results show that GppNHp-bound proteins exhibit significant state 1 population, whereas GTP-bound KRAS is primarily (90% or more) in state 2 conformation. This observation suggests that the predominance of state 1 shown here and in other studies is related to GppNHp and is most likely nonexistent in cells. We characterize the impact of this differential conformational equilibrium of oncogenic KRAS on RAF1 kinase effector RAS-binding domain and intrinsic hydrolysis. Through a KRAS G12C drug discovery, we have identified a novel small-molecule inhibitor, BBO-8956, which is effective against both GDP- and GTP-bound KRAS G12C. We show that binding of this inhibitor significantly perturbs state 1-state 2 equilibrium and induces an inactive state 1 conformation in GTP-bound KRAS G12C. In the presence of BBO-8956, RAF1-RAS-binding domain is unable to induce a signaling competent state 2 conformation within the ternary complex, demonstrating the mechanism of action for this novel and active-conformation inhibitor.",2024-01-16
38237649,Application research of novel peptide mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant SS-31 in mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction.,"Due to the pivotal role of mitochondria in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the regulation of cellular homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction may exert a profound impact on various physiological systems, potentially precipitating a spectrum of distinct diseases. Consequently, research pertaining to mitochondrial therapeutics has assumed increasing significance, warranting heightened scrutiny. In recent years, the field of mitochondrial therapy has witnessed noteworthy advancements, with active exploration into diverse pharmacological agents aimed at ameliorating mitochondrial function. Elamipretide (SS-31), a novel synthetic mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, has emerged as a promising candidate with extensive therapeutic potential. Its notable attributes encompass the mitigation of oxidative stress, the suppression of inflammatory processes, the maintenance of mitochondrial dynamics, and the prevention of cellular apoptosis.

38233164,Precisely Activating cGAS-STING Pathway with a Novel Peptide-Based Nanoagonist to Potentiate Immune Checkpoint Blockade Cancer Immunotherapy.,"As an essential intracellular immune activation pathway, the cGAS-STING pathway has attracted broad attention in cancer treatment. However, low bioavailability, nonspecificity, and adverse effects of small molecule STING agonists severely limit their therapeutic efficacy and in vivo application. In this study, a peptide-based STING agonist is first proposed, and KLA is screened out to activate the cGAS-STING pathway by promoting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. To precisely activate the cGAS-STING pathway and block the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, a multi-stimuli activatable peptide nanodrug (MAPN) is developed for the effective delivery of KLA and PD-L1 antagonist peptide (CVR). With rational design, MAPN achieved the site-specific release of KLA and CVR in response to multiple endogenous stimuli, simultaneously activating the cGAS-STING pathway and blocking PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, ultimately initiating robust and durable T cell anti-tumor immunity with a tumor growth inhibition rate of 78% and extending the median survival time of B16F10 tumor-bearing mice to 40 days. Overall, antimicrobial peptides, which can promote mtDNA leakage through damaging mitochondrial membranes, may be potential alternatives for small molecule STING agonists and giving a new insight for the design of novel STING agonists. Furthermore, MAPN presents a universal delivery platform for the effective synergy of multiple peptides.",2024-01-17

The antenatal safety of novel small molecules for IBD is yet to be ascertained. We aimed to describe the current evidence on reproductive data regarding small-molecule drugs. We performed a systematic review searching Embase Classic + Embase and Ovid MEDLINE for reproductive outcomes for tofacitinib, filgotinib, upadacitininb, and ozanimod. Additionally, we asked the manufacturers for available data on file regarding reproduction. We analysed data from 10 sources; six studies and four manufacturer reports were identified from our search. Significant malformation risks were reported for tofacitinib, filgotinib, upadacitininb, and ozanimod in animal studies. In 126 tofacitinib-exposed pregnancies, there were 55 live births with 2 congenital malformations and 1 serious infant infection, 14 terminations, 15 miscarriages, and 42 outcomes unknown. In 50 filgotinib-exposed pregnancies, there were 20 healthy babies, 1 congenital malformation, 9 terminations, 10 miscarriages, and 10 outcomes unknown. In 78 upadacitinib-exposed pregnancies, there were 30 healthy babies, 15 terminations, 15 miscarriages, and 18 outcomes unknown. In 60 ozanimod-exposed pregnancies, there were 31 live births with 1 congenital malformation, 1 case of intra-uterine growth restriction, 1 case of neonatal icterus, 13 terminations, 9 miscarriages, and 8 unknown outcomes. Animal data suggest significant risks of malformations for tofacitinib, filgotinib, upadacitininb, and ozanimod. Human data from clinical trials and real-world observations do not show concerning data so far, but these are very limited. Currently, alternative treatments should be used for IBD during pregnancy.",2023-12-20
38198052,Unlocking the Potential of Obestatin: A Novel Peptide Intervention for Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Prevention of Atrophy.,"Obestatin is derived from the same gene as that of ghrelin and their functions were perceived to be antagonistic. Recent developments have shown that although they are known to have contradictory functions, effect of obestatin on skeletal muscle regeneration is similar to that of ghrelin. Obestatin works through a receptor called GPR39, a ghrelin and motilin family receptor and transduces signals in skeletal muscle similar to that of ghrelin. Not only there is a similarity in the receptor family, but also obestatin targets similar proteins and transcription factors as that of ghrelin (for example, FoxO family members) for salvaging skeletal muscle atrophy. Moreover, like ghrelin, obestatin also works by inducing the transcription of Pax7 which is required for muscle stem cell mobilisation. Hence, there are quite some evidences which points to the fact that obestatin can be purposed as a peptide intervention to prevent skeletal muscle wasting and induce myogenesis. This review elaborates these aspects of obestatin which can be further exploited and addressed to bring obestatin as a clinical intervention towards preventing skeletal muscle atrophy and sarcopenia.",2024-01-10

38183862,Applications of cryo-EM in drug development for STING.,STING is a critical adaptor protein in the cGAS-mediated DNA-sensing innate immune pathway. Binding of the second messenger cGAMP generated by cGAS to STING induces the high-order oligomerization and activation of the STING dimer. STING is a promising target for diseases associated with the cGAS/STING pathway such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Recent applications of cryo-EM to STING have led to exciting progress in the understanding of its regulatory mechanism. Cryo-EM structures of STING bound to either cGAMP mimetics or novel small molecule ligands not only revealed the action mechanisms of these ligands but also suggested new ways to modulate the activity of STING for therapeutic purposes.

38176026,Discovery of Natural Ah Receptor Antagonists from <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge and Synthesis of Analogs for Tumor Immunotherapy.,"IDO/TDO/Kyn/AhR signaling plays a crucial role in regulating innate and adaptive immunity, and targeting Ah receptor (AhR) inhibition can potentially redirect immune cells toward an antitumoral phenotype. Therefore, AhR is an attractive drug target for novel small molecule cancer immunotherapies. In this study, natural products tanshinolic A-D (<b>1-4</b>), the first adducts composed of <i>ortho</i>-naphthoquinone-type tanshinone and phenolic acid featuring a unique 1,4-benzodioxan hemiacetal structure, were isolated and characterized from the roots of <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge. Luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that these adducts exhibited significant AhR inhibitory activity.

38170991,SMR peptide antagonizes <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> biofilm formation.,"The emergence and international dissemination of multi-drug resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) strains challenge current antibiotic-based therapies, representing an urgent threat to public health worldwide. In the U.S. alone, <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> infections are responsible for 11,000 deaths and 500,000 hospitalizations annually. Biofilm formation is a major contributor to antibiotic tolerance and resistance-induced delays in empirical therapy with increased infection severity, frequency, treatment failure, and mortality. Developing novel treatment strategies to prevent and disrupt biofilm formation is imperative. In this article, we test the Secretion Modification Region (SMR) peptides for inhibitory effects on resistant <i>S. aureus</i> biofilm-forming capacity by targeting the molecular chaperone DnaK. The dose effect of SMR peptides on biofilm formation was assessed using microtiter plate methods and confocal microscopy. Interaction between the antagonist and DnaK was determined by immune precipitation with anti-Flag M2 Affinity and Western blot analysis. Increasing SMR peptide concentrations exhibited increasing blockade of <i>S. aureus</i> biofilm formation with significant inhibition found at 18 µM, 36 µM, and 72 µM. This work supports the potential therapeutic benefit of SMR peptides in reducing biofilm viability and could improve the susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.IMPORTANCEThe development of anti-biofilm agents is critical to restoring bacterial sensitivity, directly combating the evolution of resistance, and overall reducing the clinical burden related to pervasive biofilm-mediated infections. Thus, in this study, the SMR peptide, a novel small molecule derived from the HIV Nef protein, was preliminarily explored for anti-biofilm properties. The SMR peptide was shown to effectively target the molecular chaperone DnaK and inhibit biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner.

38170984,Novel small-molecule compound YH7 inhibits the biofilm formation of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in a <i>sarX</i>-dependent manner.,"The emergence of antibiotic-resistant and biofilm-producing <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> isolates presents major challenges for treating staphylococcal infections. Biofilm inhibition is an important anti-virulence strategy. In this study, a novel maleimide-diselenide hybrid compound (YH7) was synthesized and demonstrated remarkable antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible <i>S. aureus</i> (MSSA) in both planktonic cultures and biofilms. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of YH7 for <i>S. aureus</i> isolates was 16 µg/mL. Quantification of biofilms demonstrated that the sub-MIC (4 µg/mL) of YH7 significantly inhibits biofilm formation in both MSSA and MRSA. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis further confirmed the biofilm inhibitory potential of YH7. YH7 also significantly suppressed bacterial adherence to A549 cells. Moreover, YH7 treatment significantly inhibited <i>S. aureus</i> colonization in nasal tissue of mice. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that YH7 exerted potent biofilm-suppressing effects by inhibiting polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) synthesis, rather than suppressing bacterial autolysis. Real-time quantitative PCR data indicated that YH7 downregulated biofilm formation-related genes (<i>clfA</i>, <i>fnbA</i>, <i>icaA,</i> and <i>icaD</i>) and the global regulatory gene <i>sarX</i>, which promotes PIA synthesis. The <i>sarX</i>-dependent antibiofilm potential of YH7 was validated by constructing <i>S. aureus</i> NCTC8325 <i>sarX</i> knockout and complementation strains. Importantly, YH7 demonstrated a low potential to induce drug resistance in <i>S. aureus</i> and exhibited non-toxic to rabbit erythrocytes, A549, and BEAS-2B cells at antibacterial concentrations. <i>In vivo</i> toxicity assays conducted on <i>Galleria mellonella</i> further confirmed that YH7 is biocompatible. Overall, YH7 demonstrated potent antibiofilm activity supports its potential as an antimicrobial agent against <i>S. aureus</i> biofilm-related infections. IMPORTANCE Biofilm-associated infections, characterized by antibiotic resistance and persistence, present a formidable challenge in healthcare. Traditional antibacterial agents prove inadequate against biofilms. In this study, the novel compound YH7 demonstrates potent antibiofilm properties by impeding the adhesion and the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin production of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Notably, its exceptional efficacy against both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains highlights its broad applicability. This study highlights the potential of YH7 as a novel therapeutic agent to address the pressing issue of biofilm-driven infections.",2024-01-03
38164158,Selective induction of Rab9-dependent alternative mitophagy using a synthetic derivative of isoquinoline alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease models.,"<b>Rationale:</b> Promotion of mitophagy is considered a promising strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The development of mitophagy-specific inducers with low toxicity and defined molecular mechanisms is essential for the clinical application of mitophagy-based therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a novel small-molecule mitophagy inducer, ALT001, as a treatment for AD. <b>Methods:</b> ALT001 was developed through chemical optimization of an isoquinolium scaffold, which was identified from a chemical library screening using a mitophagy reporter system. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential of ALT001 as a mitophagy-targeting therapeutic agent and to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying ALT001-induced mitophagy. The therapeutic effect of ALT001 was assessed in SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant APP and mouse models of AD (5×FAD and PS2APP) by analyzing mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive defects. <b>Results:</b> ALT001 specifically induces mitophagy both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> but is nontoxic to mitochondria. Interestingly, we found that ALT001 induces mitophagy through the ULK1-Rab9-dependent alternative mitophagy pathway independent of canonical mitophagy pathway regulators such as ATG7 and PINK1. Importantly, ALT001 reverses mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant APP in a mitophagy-dependent manner. ALT001 induces alternative mitophagy in mice and restores the decreased mitophagy level in a 5×FAD AD model mouse. In addition, ALT001 reverses mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive defects in the PS2APP and 5×FAD AD mouse models. AAV-mediated silencing of Rab9 in the hippocampus further confirmed that ALT001 exerts its therapeutic effect through alternative mitophagy. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results highlight the therapeutic potential of ALT001 for AD via alleviation of mitochondrial dysfunction and indicate the usefulness of the ULK1-Rab9 alternative mitophagy pathway as a therapeutic target.",2024-01-01

38160914,Recent drug design strategies and identification of key heterocyclic scaffolds for promising anticancer targets.,"Cancer, a noncommunicable disease, is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and is anticipated to rise by 75% in the next two decades, reaching approximately 25 million cases. Traditional cancer treatments, such as radiotherapy and surgery, have shown limited success in reducing cancer incidence. As a result, the focus of cancer chemotherapy has switched to the development of novel small molecule antitumor agents as an alternate strategy for combating and managing cancer rates. Heterocyclic compounds are such agents that bind to specific residues in target proteins, inhibiting their function and potentially providing cancer treatment. This review focuses on privileged heterocyclic pharmacophores with potent activity against carbonic anhydrases and kinases, which are important anticancer targets. Evaluation of ongoing pre-clinical and clinical research of heterocyclic compounds with potential therapeutic value against a variety of malignancies as well as the provision of a concise summary of the role of heterocyclic scaffolds in various chemotherapy protocols have also been discussed. The main objective of the article is to highlight key heterocyclic scaffolds involved in recent anticancer drug design that demands further attention from the drug development community to find more effective and safer targeted small-molecule anticancer agents.",2023-12-30
38150935,"Synthesis, molecular docking, electrochemical and fluorimetric analysis of new caffeic and cinnamic acid-conjugated hemorphin derivatives designed as potential anticonvulsant and antinociceptive agents.","Based on the pharmacophore model of opioid receptors, our team recently synthesized a series of short-chain hemorphin peptide analogs containing non-natural amino acids. They demonstrated anticonvulsant and antinociceptive activity with low neurotoxicity. In the present study, a series of novel bioconjugates of N-modified hemorphin analogs containing second pharmacophore cinnamic acids (CA) or caffeic (KA) were synthesized by a traditional solid-phase Fmoc chemistry method for peptide synthesis. Electrochemical and fluorimetric analysis, in vivo anticonvulsant and antinociceptive activity in mice were conducted on the compounds. The three CA acid- (H4-CA, H5-CA, and H7-CA) and three KA acid- (H4-KA, H5-KA, and H7-KA) conjugated hemorphin derivatives exhibited potency at the highest doses of 2 µg/5 µl, administered by intracerebroventricular (icv) mode, against seizure spread in the maximal electroshock test (MES) in mice. The KA-conjugated H5-KA derivate, at the lowest dose, was the only compound that suppressed clonic seizures in the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol (scPTZ) test. Except for the H5-CA, all tested CA acid- and KA acid-conjugated peptide derivates had the potency to increase the latency for clonic seizures in a dose-dependent mode. The activity against the psychomotor seizures in the 6-Hz test was detected only for the H4-CA (0.5 µg) and H4-KA (0.5 µg and 1 µg), respectively. All investigated peptides showed a more pronounced antinociceptive effect in the ""intraplantar formalin"" test compared to the ""hot plate"" test. Shorter chain analogs showed a better antinociceptive profile against tonic pain. The data suggest a DOR and KOR-mediated mechanism of action. According to the docking analysis, H7-CA showed a different antinociceptive profile than other investigated peptides. The novel peptide derivates did not exhibit neurotoxicity in the rotarod test. Our findings suggest that conjugated CA and KA morphine peptides can be used to develop novel morphine-related analogs with anticonvulsant and antinociceptive activity.",2023-12-25

In our efforts to develop novel small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors, a 1-(5-chloro-2-methoxybenzyl)-4-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole scaffold was designed via a rational approach based on our previous leads. Structure-activity relationship studies and biophysical studies identified a new lead compound <b>8</b> as a potent (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.55 ± 0.16 μM), selective, and direct NLRP3 inhibitor. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies of [<sup>11</sup>C]<b>8</b> demonstrated its rapid and high brain uptake as well as fast washout in mice and rhesus macaque. Notably, plasma kinetic analysis of this radiotracer from the PET/magnetic resonance imaging studies in rhesus macaque suggested radiometabolic stability.

38139260,The LIFR Inhibitor EC359 Effectively Targets Type II Endometrial Cancer by Blocking LIF/LIFR Oncogenic Signaling.,"Endometrial cancer (ECa) is the most common female gynecologic cancer. When comparing the two histological subtypes of endometrial cancer, Type II tumors are biologically more aggressive and have a worse prognosis than Type I tumors. Current treatments for Type II tumors are ineffective, and new targeted therapies are urgently needed. LIFR and its ligand, LIF, have been shown to play a critical role in the progression of multiple solid cancers and therapy resistance. The role of LIF/LIFR in the progression of Type II ECa, on the other hand, is unknown. We investigated the role of LIF/LIFR signaling in Type II ECa and tested the efficacy of EC359, a novel small-molecule LIFR inhibitor, against Type II ECa. The analysis of tumor databases has uncovered a correlation between diminished survival rates and increased expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), suggesting a potential connection between altered LIF expression and unfavorable overall survival in Type II ECa. The results obtained from cell viability and colony formation assays demonstrated a significant decrease in the growth of Type II ECa LIFR knockdown cells in comparison to vector control cells. Furthermore, in both primary and established Type II ECa cells, pharmacological inhibition of the LIF/LIFR axis with EC359 markedly decreased cell viability, long-term cell survival, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. Additionally, EC359 treatment reduced the activation of pathways driven by LIF/LIFR, such as AKT, mTOR, and STAT3. Tumor progression was markedly inhibited by EC359 treatment in two different patient-derived xenograft models in vivo and patient-derived organoids ex vivo. Collectively, these results suggest LIFR inhibitor EC359 as a possible new small-molecule therapeutics for the management of Type II ECa.",2023-12-13
38138609,"Exploring Thiazolopyridine AV25R: Unraveling of Biological Activities, Selective Anti-Cancer Properties and In Silico Target and Binding Prediction in Hematological Neoplasms.","Thiazolopyridines are a highly relevant class of small molecules, which have previously shown a wide range of biological activities. Besides their anti-tubercular, anti-microbial and anti-viral activities, they also show anti-cancerogenic properties, and play a role as inhibitors of cancer-related proteins. Herein, the biological effects of the thiazolopyridine AV25R, a novel small molecule with unknown biological effects, were characterized. Screening of a set of lymphoma (SUP-T1, SU-DHL-4) and B- acute leukemia cell lines (RS4;11, SEM) revealed highly selective effects of AV25R. The selective anti-proliferative and metabolism-modulating effects were observed in vitro for the B-ALL cell line RS4;11. Further, we were able to detect severe morphological changes and the induction of apoptosis. Gene expression analysis identified a large number of differentially expressed genes after AV25R exposure and significant differentially regulated cancer-related signaling pathways, such as VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling and the EGF/EGFR pathway. Structure-based pharmacophore screening approaches using in silico modeling identified potential biological AV25R targets. Our results indicate that AV25R binds with several proteins known to regulate cell proliferation and tumor progression, such as FECH, MAP11, EGFR, TGFBR1 and MDM2. The molecular docking analyses indicates that AV25R has a higher binding affinity compared to many of the experimentally validated small molecule inhibitors of these targets. Thus, here we present in vitro and in silico analyses which characterize, for the first time, the molecular acting mechanism of AV25R, including cellular and molecular biologic effects. Additionally, this predicted the target binding of the molecule, revealing a high affinity to cancer-related proteins and, thus, classified AVR25 for targeted intervention approaches.",2023-12-15
38132960,"Novel BRICHOS-Related Antimicrobial Peptides from the Marine Worm <i>Heteromastus filiformis</i>: Transcriptome Mining, Synthesis, Biological Activities, and Therapeutic Potential.","Marine polychaetes represent an extremely rich and underexplored source of novel families of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The rapid development of next generation sequencing technologies and modern bioinformatics approaches allows us to apply them for characterization of AMP-derived genes and the identification of encoded immune-related peptides with the aid of genome and transcriptome mining. Here, we describe a universal bioinformatic approach based on the conserved BRICHOS domain as a search query for the identification of novel structurally unique AMP families in annelids. In this paper, we report the discovery of 13 novel BRICHOS-related peptides, ranging from 18 to 91 amino acid residues in length, in the cosmopolitan marine worm <i>Heteromastus filiformis</i> with the assistance of transcriptome mining. Two characteristic peptides with a low homology in relation to known AMPs-the α-helical amphiphilic linear peptide, consisting of 28 amino acid residues and designated as HfBRI-28, and the 25-mer β-hairpin peptide, specified as HfBRI-25 and having a unique structure stabilized by two disulfide bonds-were obtained and analyzed as potential antimicrobials. Interestingly, both peptides showed the ability to kill bacteria via membrane damage, but mechanisms of their action and spectra of their activity differed significantly. Being non-cytotoxic towards mammalian cells and stable to proteolysis in the blood serum, HfBRI-25 was selected for further <i>in vivo</i> studies in a lethal murine model of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection, where the peptide contributed to the 100% survival rate in animals. A high activity against uropathogenic strains of <i>E. coli</i> (UPEC) as well as a strong ability to kill bacteria within biofilms allow us to consider the novel peptide HfBRI-25 as a promising candidate for the clinical therapy of urinary tract infections (UTI) associated with UPEC.",2023-12-14
38131333,"Unlocking novel therapies: cyclic peptide design for amyloidogenic targets through synergies of experiments, simulations, and machine learning.","Existing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's address only their symptoms and do not prevent disease onset. Common therapeutic agents, such as small molecules and antibodies struggle with insufficient selectivity, stability and bioavailability, leading to poor performance in clinical trials. Peptide-based therapeutics are emerging as promising candidates, with successful applications for cardiovascular diseases and cancers due to their high bioavailability, good efficacy and specificity. In particular, cyclic peptides have a long <i>in vivo</i> stability, while maintaining a robust antibody-like binding affinity. However, the <i>de novo</i> design of cyclic peptides is challenging due to the lack of long-lived druggable pockets of the target polypeptide, absence of exhaustive conformational distributions of the target and/or the binder, unknown binding site, methodological limitations, associated constraints (failed trials, time, money) and the vast combinatorial sequence space. Hence, efficient alignment and cooperation between disciplines, and synergies between experiments and simulations complemented by popular techniques like machine-learning can significantly speed up the therapeutic cyclic-peptide development for neurodegenerative diseases. We review the latest advancements in cyclic peptide design against amyloidogenic targets from a computational perspective in light of recent advancements and potential of machine learning to optimize the design process. We discuss the difficulties encountered when designing novel peptide-based inhibitors and we propose new strategies incorporating experiments, simulations and machine learning to design cyclic peptides to inhibit the toxic propagation of amyloidogenic polypeptides. Importantly, these strategies extend beyond the mere design of cyclic peptides and serve as template for the <i>de novo</i> generation of (bio)materials with programmable properties.",2024-01-16

This study aims in identifying novel anti-inflammatory NF-κB inhibitor by high-throughput computational and in-vitro pre-clinical approaches. Lead candidate selection was conducted by the use of computational docking molecular-dynamic simulations. The RBL-2H3 cell line, derived from rat basophils, was used to evaluate the release of cytokines and degranulation. The study focused on the study of neutrophil elastase and its role in cellular motility. Flow cytometry was utilized to evaluate the activation of basophils and the expression of critical signaling proteins. High throughput screening identified CSB-0914 to stably bind NF-κB-p50 subunit. Dose based loss in T NF-α and IL-2 release were observed in RBL-2H3 cells in addition to degranulation inhibition by CSB-0914. The compound demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing basophil activation assay induced by FcεRI receptors, with an IC50 value of 98.41 nM.. A dose dependent decrease in neutrophil migration and elastase were observed when treated with CSB- 0914. The compound was effective in decreasing. Upon stimulation, RBL-2H3 cells exhibited phosphorylation of NF-κB p-65 as well as upregulation of the Nrf2 and HO-1 signaling pathways. Collectively, our study has successfully identified a novel inhibitor called CSB-0914 that effectively regulates inflammatory responses. These reactions are primarily mediated by the interplay between NF-κB, Nrf2, and HO-1. The findings of this study provide support for the need to conduct more research on CSB-0914 with the aim of its development as a pharmaceutical agent for anti-inflammatory purposes.",2023-12-21
38124427,"Proline-Hinged α-Helical Peptides Sensitize Gram-Positive Antibiotics, Expanding Their Physicochemical Properties to Be Used as Gram-Negative Antibiotics.","The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria is the most difficult obstacle for small-molecule antibiotics to reach their targets in the cytosol. The molecular features of Gram-negative antibiotics required for passing through the OM are that they should be positively charged rather than neutral, flat rather than globular, less flexible, or more increased amphiphilic moment. Because of these specific molecular characteristics, developing Gram-negative antibiotics is difficult. We focused on sensitizer peptides to facilitate the passage of hydrophobic Gram-positive antibiotics through the OM. We explored ways of improving the sensitizing ability of proline-hinged α-helical peptides by adjusting their length, hydrophobicity, and N-terminal groups. A novel peptide, 1403, improves the potentiation of rifampicin <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and potentiates most Gram-positive antibiotics. The ""sensitizer"" approach is more plausible than those that rely on conventional drug discovery methods concerning drug development costs and the development of drug resistance.",2023-12-21

This study examined the role of MARK1 or MARK2 in regulating neurosynaptic plasticity induced by neuropathic pain.",2024-03-11
38109786,MT-EpiPred: Multitask Learning for Prediction of Small-Molecule Epigenetic Modulators.,"Epigenetic modulators play an increasingly crucial role in the treatment of various diseases. In this case, it is imperative to systematically investigate the activity of these agents and understand their influence on the entire epigenetic regulatory network rather than solely concentrate on individual targets. This work introduces MT-EpiPred, a multitask learning method capable of predicting the activity of compounds against 78 epigenetic targets. MT-EpiPred demonstrated outstanding performance, boasting an average auROC of 0.915 and the ability to handle few-shot targets. In comparison to the existing method, MT-EpiPred not only expands the target pool but also achieves superior predictive performance with the same data set. MT-EpiPred was then applied to predict the epigenetic target of a newly synthesized compound (<b>1</b>), where the molecular target was unknown. The method identified KDM4D as a potential target, which was subsequently validated through an <i>in vitro</i> enzyme inhibition assay, revealing an IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.8 μM. The MT-EpiPred method has been implemented in the web server MT-EpiPred (http://epipred.com), providing free accessibility. In summary, this work presents a convenient and accurate tool for discovering novel small-molecule epigenetic modulators, particularly in the development of selective inhibitors and evaluating the impact of these inhibitors over a broad epigenetic network.",2023-12-18
38106460,Novel peptide inhibitors targeting CD40 and CD40L interaction: A potential for atherosclerosis therapy.,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by plaque build-up in the arteries, leading to the obstruction of blood flow. Macrophages are the primary immune cells found in the atherosclerotic lesions and are directly involved in atherosclerosis progression. Macrophages are derived from extravasating blood monocytes. The monocytic CD40 receptor is important for monocyte recruitment on the endothelium expressing the CD40 ligand (CD40L). Thus, targeting monocyte/macrophage interaction with the endothelium by inhibiting CD40-CD40L interaction may be a promising strategy for attenuating atherosclerosis. Monoclonal antibodies have been used against this target but shows various complications. We used an array of computer-aided drug discovery tools and molecular docking approaches to design a therapeutic inhibitory peptide that could efficiently bind to the critical residues (82Y, 84D, and 86N) on the CD40 receptor essential for the receptor's binding to CD40L. The initial screen identified a parent peptide with a high binding affinity to CD40, but the peptide exhibited a positive hepatotoxicity score. We then designed several novel peptidomimetic derivatives with higher binding affinities to CD40, good physicochemical properties, and negative hepatotoxicity as compared to the parent peptide. Furthermore, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations for both the apo and complexed forms of the receptor with ligand, and screened peptides to evaluate their stability. The designed peptidomimetic derivatives are promising therapeutics targeting the CD40-CD40L interaction and may potentially be used to attenuate atherosclerosis.",2023-11-14

Pertuzumab, as the first monoclonal antibody inhibitor of HER2 dimerization, has been FDA-approved for HER2-positive patients. In order to enhance the activity of HER2-targeted peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) developed based on pertuzumab, a novel class of conjugates 1-9 was designed and synthesized by fusing the N-terminal peptide sequence of the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) with P1, followed by conjugation with CPT molecules. Compound 4 exhibited excellent in vitro anti-tumor activity across the three HER2-positive cell lines, comparable to the activity of CPT. Apoptosis induction assays indicated that the synergistic effect of the SMAC sequence enhanced the pro-apoptotic activity of the conjugate. Western Blot analysis and Caspase activity studies validated the mechanism through which SMAC peptides, in synergy with CPT, enhance the activity of PDCs. In vivo studies demonstrated that compound 4 possesses superior anti-tumor activity compared to CPT and can effectively mitigate potential renal toxicity associated with free SMAC peptides. In conclusion, conjugate 4 exhibited excellent anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, offering potential for further development as a novel peptide-conjugated drug.",2023-12-07

An effective strategy for exogenously activating the immune system involves the utilization of STING agonists, and prior investigations primarily concentrated on modifying endogenous cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) to achieve this. Nevertheless, the practical utility of CDNs was restricted due to limitations associated with their physicochemical attributes and administration protocols. In this article, we present the discovery of a novel small-molecule agonist denoted as M335, identified through high-throughput screening using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). M335 demonstrates the ability to activate the TBK1-IRF3-IFN axis in a STING-dependent manner in vitro. Through experimentation on mouse models bearing tumors, we observed that the administration of M335 resulted in the activation of immune cells. Notably, significant antitumor effects were achieved with both intratumoral and intraperitoneal administration of M335. These findings suggest the potential of M335 as a promising agent for cancer immunotherapy, which will promote the development of STING agonists in anti-tumor applications.",2023-12-02

Herein, we describe the microbiological profile, the mechanism f action, and the <i>in vitro</i> safety as well as the pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD profile of SMT-738, a small molecule belonging to a new chemical class. SMT-738 is active against Enterobacterales [including multi-drug-resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i> with 90% of isolates having a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC<sub>90</sub>) of 1 µg/mL and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> 2 µg/mL] and inactive against a broad panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. SMT-738 displays rapid bactericidal activity (2-4 h) and has a low propensity for resistance development (less than ~10<sup>-9</sup>). Characterization of resistant mutants following exposure to SMT-738 identified mutations within the lipoprotein transport complex (LolCDE), a clinically unexploited and essential bacterial molecular target in Gram-negative bacteria. SMT-738 has a promising <i>in vitro</i> toxicology profile. Furthermore, PK studies demonstrated that when dosed intravenously, SMT-738 maintained exposure levels across infection sites (bloodstream/urinary tract/lung). Proof-of-concept studies across multiple murine <i>in vivo</i> infection models (bloodstream/pneumonia/urinary tract) demonstrated that SMT-738 significantly reduced the bacterial burden compared to baseline and vehicle control.

38084501,Design and Characterization of a Novel eEF2K Degrader with Potent Therapeutic Efficacy Against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"Dysregulated eEF2K expression is implicated in the pathogenesis of many human cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), making it a plausible therapeutic target. However, specific eEF2K inhibitors with potent anti-cancer activity have not been available so far. Targeted protein degradation has emerged as a new strategy for drug discovery. In this study, a novel small molecule chemical is designed and synthesized, named as compound C1, which shows potent activity in degrading eEF2K. C1 selectively binds to F8, L10, R144, C146, E229, and Y236 of the eEF2K protein and promotes its proteasomal degradation by increasing the interaction between eEF2K and the ubiquitin E3 ligase βTRCP in the form of molecular glue. C1 significantly inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of TNBC cells both in vitro and in vivo and in TNBC patient-derived organoids, and these antitumor effects are attributed to the degradation of eEF2K by C1. Additionally, combination treatment of C1 with paclitaxel, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug, exhibits synergistic anti-tumor effects against TNBC. This study not only generates a powerful research tool to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting eEF2K, but also provides a promising lead compound for developing novel drugs for the treatment of TNBC and other cancers.",2023-12-12
38074470,"A promising antibiotic candidate, brevinin-1 analogue 5R, against drug-resistant bacteria, with insights into its membrane-targeting mechanism.","In recent decades, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have held great promise as novel antibiotic agents. However, they have generally been excluded from clinical use due to certain limitations, such as poor biocompatibility and sensitivity to environmental conditions. In this study, we report a novel brevinin-1 type antimicrobial peptide B1LTe, derived from the skin secretion of <i>Hylarana latouchii</i>. Although the novel peptide B1LTe exhibited remarkable antimicrobial effects, its narrow therapeutic index (TI) can result in adverse drug reactions. Thus, the rational design by systematically scanning and replacing the inherent hydrophobic and cationic residues (Leucine and Lysine) with their D-enantiomeric counterparts was conducted to enhance the application potential of B1LTe. Simultaneously, we also applied lysine-to-arginine substitution within the modification. Among the derivates, 5 R demonstrated the highest selectivity and effectiveness against Methicillin-resistant <i>Streptococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), clinic-isolated <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (<i>S. pyogenes</i>) strain, ranging from their planktonic to biofilm cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the remarkable adaptation of 5 R in saline and 20% serum indicates its potential for clinical application. We employed the in silico approach, which revealed the mechanism of interaction between 5 R and bacterial membranes. In addition, further mechanistic studies of 5 R elucidated the association between the collapsed proton motive force (PMF) and membrane perturbation as peptides aggregate on the bacterial membrane. Overall, our study suggests the D-enantiomeric 5 R can be a promising antibiotic agent against MDR bacteria in further clinical development and highlights the significance of cellular PMF as a potential target for the research of peptides' mode of action.",2023-11-19

The thrombocytopenia ranges from mild (50 000-100 000 platelets/μL), to severe (20 000 to <50 000/μL), to profound (<20 000/μL). Profound thrombocytopenia appears to occur in <1% of patients receiving their first course of therapy. Thrombocytopenia can be either acute (<24 hours) or delayed (up to ~14 days). Both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications have been reported in association with thrombocytopenia. Diagnosis requires exclusion of pseudothrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Therapy based on the severity of thrombocytopenia and symptoms may include drug withdrawals and treatment with steroids, intravenous IgG, and platelet transfusions. Abciximab-associated thrombocytopenia is most common and due to either preformed antibodies or antibodies induced in response to abciximab (delayed). Readministration of abciximab is associated with increased risk of thrombocytopenia. Evidence also supports an immune basis for thrombocytopenia associated with the 2 small molecule GPIs. The latter bind αIIbβ3 like the natural ligands and thus induce the receptor to undergo major conformational changes that potentially create neoepitopes. Thrombocytopenia associated with these drugs is also immune-mediated, with antibodies recognizing the αIIbβ3 receptor only in the presence of the drug. It is unclear whether the antibody binding depends on the conformational change and whether the drug contributes directly to the epitope. Zalunfiban, a second-generation subcutaneous small molecule GPI, does not induce the conformational changes; therefore, data from studies of zalunfiban will provide information on the contribution of the conformational changes to the development of GPI-associated thrombocytopenia.",2023-12-08
38055970,Solid-Phase Synthesis of Caged Luminescent Peptides via Side Chain Anchoring.,"The synthesis of caged luminescent peptide substrates remains challenging, especially when libraries of the substrates are required. Most currently available synthetic methods rely on a solution-phase approach, which is less suited for parallel synthesis purposes. We herein present a solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) method for the synthesis of caged aminoluciferin peptides via side chain anchoring of the P<sub>1</sub> residue. After the synthesis of a preliminary test library consisting of 40 compounds, the synthetic method was validated and optimized for up to >100 g of resin. Subsequently, two separate larger peptide libraries were synthesized either having a P<sub>1</sub> = lysine or arginine residue containing in total 719 novel peptide substrates. The use of a more stable caged nitrile precursor instead of caged aminoluciferin rendered our parallel synthetic approach completely suitable for SPPS and serine protease profiling was demonstrated using late-stage aminoluciferin generation.",2023-12-06
38054966,Discovery of (2-(4-Substituted phenyl)quinolin-4-yl)(4-isopropylpiperazin-1-yl)methanone Derivatives as Potent Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 Inhibitors.,"Inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays an increasingly important role in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. In pursuit of potent small molecules that block the PCSK9/low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein-protein interaction (PPI), a series of 2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylic acid derivatives were designed and synthesized based on previously derived molecules. In the in vitro PPI inhibition test, compounds M1, M12, M14, M18 and M27 exhibited potent activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.25 μM, 0.91 μM, 2.81 μM, 4.26 μM and 0.76 μM, respectively, compared with SBC-115337 (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 9.24 μM). Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the binding of inhibitors to the PPI interface of PCSK9. In LDLR expression and LDL uptake assays, the tested compounds M1, M12 and M14 were found to restore LDLR expression levels and to increase the extracellular LDL uptake capacity of HepG2 cells in the presence of exogenous PCSK9. Collectively, novel small-molecule PCSK9/LDLR PPI inhibitors (especially M12) with in vitro lipid lowering ability, were discovered as lead compounds for further development of hypolipidemic drugs.",2023-12-13

38043914,Release of a novel peptide from ferritin nanocages: A new tool for therapeutic applications.,"The development of new drug delivery systems for targeted chemotherapy release in cancer cells represents a very promising tool. In this contest, protein-based nanocages have considerable potential as drug delivery devices. Notably, ferritin has emerged as an excellent candidate due to its unique architecture, surface properties and high biocompatibility. A promising strategy might then involve ferritin cargos for specifical release of AntiMicrobial Peptides endowed with anticancer activity to cancer cells. In this paper, we encapsulated the TRIL analogue of Temporin-L peptide within a ferritin nanocage and evaluated the cargo biological properties. The results demonstrated a reduced haemolytic activity of the peptide and a selective cytotoxicity activity on cancer cells likely mediated by oxidative stress while having no effects on non-tumoral cells. The combination of the properties of ferritin with TRIL, might open up the way to the development of novel peptide delivery systems for future pharmaceutical applications.",2023-12-02

38037273,"Design, synthesis, and histone deacetylase inhibition study of novel 4-(2-aminoethyl) phenol derivatives.","Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been identified as promising targets for anticancer treatment. The study demonstrates virtual screening, molecular docking, and synthesis of 4-(2-aminoethyl) phenol derivatives as HDAC inhibitors. The virtual screening and molecular docking analysis led to the identification of 10 representative compounds, which were evaluated based on their drug-like properties. The results demonstrated that these compounds effectively interacted with the active site pocket of HDAC 3 through π-stacking, Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordination, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions with catalytic residues. Furthermore, a series of 4-(2-aminoethyl) phenol derivatives were synthesized, and their HDAC inhibitory activity was evaluated. Compounds 18 and 20 showed significant HDAC inhibitory activity of 64.94 ± 1.17% and 52.45 ± 1.45%, respectively, compared to the solvent control. The promising results of this study encourage further research on 4-(2-aminoethyl) phenol derivatives and may provide significant insight into the design of novel small molecule HDAC inhibitors to fight against target-specific malignancies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and nonsmall cell lung cancer in the future.",2023-11-30

Given the disadvantages of current polysaccharide-based vaccines, the most promising alternative for developing improved vaccines may be to use protein antigens with different roles in pneumococcus virulence. PspA and PhtD, highly immunogenic surface proteins expressed by almost all pneumococcal strains, are capable of eliciting protective immunity against lethal infections.",2023-11-15
38035024,"A novel small molecule, CU05-1189, targeting the pleckstrin homology domain of PDK1 suppresses VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and tumor growth by blocking the Akt signaling pathway.","Inhibition of angiogenesis is considered a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Our previous genetic research showed that the use of a cell-penetrating peptide to inhibit the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) was a viable approach to suppress pathological angiogenesis. Herein, we synthesized and characterized a novel small molecule, CU05-1189, based on our prior study and present evidence for the first time that this compound possesses antiangiogenic properties both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The computational analysis showed that CU05-1189 can interact with the PH domain of PDK1, and it significantly inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells without apparent toxicity. Western blot analysis revealed that the Akt signaling pathway was specifically inhibited by CU05-1189 upon VEGF stimulation, without affecting other VEGF receptor 2 downstream molecules or cytosolic substrates of PDK1, by preventing translocation of PDK1 to the plasma membrane. We also found that CU05-1189 suppressed VEGF-mediated vascular network formation in a Matrigel plug assay. More importantly, CU05-1189 had a good pharmacokinetic profile with a bioavailability of 68%. These results led to the oral administration of CU05-1189, which resulted in reduced tumor microvessel density and growth in a xenograft mouse model. Taken together, our data suggest that CU05-1189 may have great potential and be a promising lead as a novel antiangiogenic agent for cancer treatment.",2023-11-16
38029599,Novel small molecule-based organic nanoparticles for second near-infrared photothermal tumor ablation.,"Second near-infrared (NIR-II,1000 ∼ 1700 nm) therapeutic window presents an increased tissue penetration and elevated maximal permissible exposure in the application of photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the lack of NIR-II photothermal conversion agents (PCAs) limit their further development. In this work, we rationally designed and successfully developed three novel indolium-like heptamethine cyanine dyes (NFs) by installing N,N-diethylamino on the terminal ends of a conjugated polyene backbone and replacing the middle chlorine atom with o-mercapto benzoic acid and p-mercapto benzoic acid. Notably, NF2 with stronger rotating group encapsulated in organic nanoparticles (NF2 NPs) exhibited high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), which could come up to (61.3 %). Then we conducted serial experiments to further investigate PTT capability of NF2 NPs 4 T1 cell line and nude mice bearing 4 T1 tumor. As expected, the resulting NF2 NPs presented the excellent photothermal conversion ability and superb PTT effect both in vivo and in vitro. This study will inspire more work for future design and clinical applications of NIR-II therapeutic agents.",2023-11-22

Presently, there is an intense and ongoing effort to identify and develop novel therapeutics for this disease. In this study, we explored the anti-inflammatory activity of a new compound, termed IOI-214, and its therapeutic potential to ameliorate NAFLD/MAFLD in male C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat (HF) diet.",2023-11-16
38025397,An algorithm for drug discovery based on deep learning with an example of developing a drug for the treatment of lung cancer.,"In this study, we present an algorithmic framework integrated within the created software platform tailored for the discovery of novel small-molecule anti-tumor agents. Our approach was exemplified in the context of combatting lung cancer. In the initial phase, target identification for therapeutic intervention was accomplished. Leveraging deep learning, we scrutinized gene expression profiles, focusing on those associated with adverse clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients. Augmenting this, generative adversarial neural (GAN) networks were employed to amass additional patient data. This effort yielded a subset of genes definitively linked to unfavorable prognoses. We further employed deep learning to delineate genes capable of discriminating between normal and tumor tissues based on expression patterns. The remaining genes were earmarked as potential targets for precision lung cancer therapy. Subsequently, a dedicated module was formulated to predict the interactions between inhibitors and proteins. To achieve this, protein amino acid sequences and chemical compound formulations engaged in protein interactions were encoded into vectorized representations. Additionally, a deep learning-based component was developed to forecast IC<sub>50</sub> values through experimentation on cell lines. Virtual pre-clinical trials employing these inhibitors facilitated the selection of pertinent cell lines for subsequent laboratory assays. In summary, our study culminated in the derivation of several small-molecule formulas projected to bind selectively to specific proteins. This algorithmic platform holds promise in accelerating the identification and design of anti-tumor compounds, a critical pursuit in advancing targeted cancer therapies.",2023-11-09
38012755,Therapeutic effect and transcriptome-methylome characteristics of METTL3 inhibition in liver hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) is the key subunit of methyltransferase complex responsible for catalyzing N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification on mRNA, which is the most prevalent post-transcriptional modification in eukaryotes. In this study, we utilized online databases to analyze the association between METTL3 expression and various aspects of tumorigenesis, including gene methylation, immunity, and prognosis. Our investigation revealed that METTL3 serves as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). Through experimental studies, we observed frequent upregulation of METTL3 in LIHC tumor tissue and cells. Subsequent inhibition of METTL3 using a novel small molecule inhibitor, STM2457, significantly impeded tumor growth in LIHC cell lines, spheroids, and xenograft tumor model. Further, transcriptome and m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing of xenograft bodies unveiled that inhibition of METTL3-m<sup>6</sup>A altered genes enriched in SMAD and MAPK signaling pathways that are critical for tumorigenesis. These findings suggest that targeting METTL3 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for LIHC.",2023-11-27
38006944,Purification and Activity Evaluation of a Novel Thrombopoietin Mimetic Peptide.,"The emergence of thrombopoietin mimetic peptides presents a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing thrombocytopenia. This particular study aimed to establish a direct, expeditious, and efficient method for modifying and purifying a novel thrombopoietin mimetic peptide. Precursor proteins were subjected to modification utilizing three distinct fatty acids: C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>42</sub>O<sub>7</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>39</sub>H<sub>66</sub>O<sub>15</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>41</sub>H<sub>70</sub>O<sub>15</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Liquid chromatography analyses demonstrated that C<sub>41</sub>H<sub>70</sub>O<sub>15</sub>N<sub>4</sub> yielded the most effective modification results. Mass spectrometry findings validated the correspondence between the theoretical and actual molecular weights of each sample. In vivo experiments conducted on normal mice showcased that the C<sub>41</sub>H<sub>70</sub>O<sub>15</sub>N<sub>4</sub> modification group exhibited the highest platelet count, peaking at an impressive 5047 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. This count was approximately twice that of the peak platelet count observed in the dTMP group and four times higher than the control group. Pharmacokinetic investigations revealed that the C<sub>41</sub>H<sub>70</sub>O<sub>15</sub>N<sub>4</sub> modification group displayed the lengthiest half-life among beagles, persisting for 128.5 h. This duration was approximately 28.5 times longer than that of the unmodified dTMP group. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the established C<sub>41</sub>H<sub>70</sub>O<sub>15</sub>N<sub>4</sub> modification and purification method in preserving the biological activity of the thrombopoietin mimetic peptide. The novel thrombopoietin mimetic peptide showcased notable attributes of simplicity and cost-effectiveness, while also exhibiting a significant platelet-promoting effect and an extended half-life. Consequently, this novel peptide holds substantial significance for advancing the treatment of thrombocytopenia.",2023-11-23
38006628,Development of chemical tools based on GSK-7975A to study store-operated calcium entry in cells.,"Many physiological functions, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, muscle contraction, neurotransmission and fertilisation, are regulated by changes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. The major Ca<sup>2+</sup> store in cells is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Certain cellular processes induce ER store depletion, e.g. by activating IP<sub>3</sub> receptors, that in turn induces a store refilling process known as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). This refilling process entails protein-protein interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing stromal interaction molecules (STIM) in the ER membrane and Orai proteins in the plasma membrane. Fully assembled STIM/Orai complexes then form highly selective Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels called Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> Channels (CRAC) through which Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions flow into the cytosol and subsequently are pumped into the ER by the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Abnormal SOCE has been associated with numerous human diseases and cancers, and therefore key players STIM and Orai have attracted significant therapeutic interest. Several potent experimental and clinical candidate compounds have been developed and have helped to study SOCE in various cell types. We have synthesized multiple novel small-molecule probes based on the known SOCE inhibitor GSK-7975A. Here we present GSK-7975A derivatives, which feature photo-caging, photo-crosslinking, biotin and clickable moieties, and also contain deuterium labels. Evaluation of these GSK-7975A probes using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR)-Tetra-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging assay showed that most synthetic modifications did not have a detrimental impact on the SOCE inhibitory activity. The photo-caged GSK-7975A was also used in patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments. In summary, we have developed a number of active, GSK-7975A-based molecular probes that have interesting properties and therefore are useful experimental tools to study SOCE in various cells and settings.",2023-11-15
38004539,Development of a Novel Peptide with Antimicrobial and Mineralising Properties for Caries Management.,"The purpose of the study is to develop a novel peptide for caries management. Gallic-Acid-Polyphemusin-I (GAPI) was synthesised by grafting Polyphemusin I (PI) and gallic acid (GA). Biocompatibility was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 Assay. Antimicrobial properties were assessed using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC). The bacterial and fungal morphology after GAPI treatment was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The architecture of a consortium biofilm consisting of <i>Streptococcus mutans, Lacticaseibacillus casei</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i> was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The growth kinetics of the biofilm was examined using a propidium monoazide-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The surface and calcium-to-phosphorus molar ratio of GAPI-treated enamel after pH cycling were examined with SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Enamel crystal characteristics were analysed using X-ray diffraction. Lesion depths representing the enamel's mineral loss were assessed using micro-computed tomography. The MIC of GAPI against <i>S. mutans</i>, <i>L. casei</i> and <i>C. albicans</i> were 40 μM, 40 μM and 20 μM, respectively. GAPI destroyed the biofilm's three-dimensional structure and inhibited the growth of the biofilm. SEM showed that enamel treated with GAPI had a relatively smooth surface compared to that treated with water. The calcium-to-phosphorus molar ratio of enamel treated with GAPI was higher than that of the control. The lesion depths and mineral loss of the GAPI-treated enamel were less than the control. The crystallinity of the GAPI-treated enamel was higher than the control. This study developed a biocompatible, mineralising and antimicrobial peptide GAPI, which may have potential as an anti-caries agent.",2023-10-31
38003456,NXC736 Attenuates Radiation-Induced Lung Fibrosis via Regulating NLRP3/IL-1β Signaling Pathway.,"Radiation-induced lung fibrosis (RILF) is a common complication of radiotherapy in lung cancer. However, to date no effective treatment has been developed for this condition. NXC736 is a novel small-molecule compound that inhibits NLRP3, but its effect on RILF is unknown. NLRP3 activation is an important trigger for the development of RILF. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of NXC736 on lung fibrosis inhibition using a RILF animal model and to elucidate its molecular signaling pathway. The left lungs of mice were irradiated with a single dose of 75 Gy. We observed that NXC736 treatment inhibited collagen deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration in irradiated mouse lung tissues. The damaged lung volume, evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, was lower in NXC736-treated mice than in irradiated mice. NXC736-treated mice exhibited significant changes in lung function parameters. NXC736 inhibited inflammasome activation by interfering with the NLRP3-ASC-cleaved caspase-1 interaction, thereby reducing the expression of IL-1β and blocking the fibrotic pathway. In addition, NXC736 treatment reduced the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers such as α-SMA, vimentin, and twist by blocking the Smad 2,3,4 signaling pathway. These data suggested that NXC736 is a potent therapeutic agent against RILF.",2023-11-13
38001148,Discovery of a novel cardiac-specific myosin modulator using artificial intelligence-based virtual screening.,"Direct modulation of cardiac myosin function has emerged as a therapeutic target for both heart disease and heart failure. However, the development of myosin-based therapeutics has been hampered by the lack of targeted in vitro screening assays. In this study we use Artificial Intelligence-based virtual high throughput screening (vHTS) to identify novel small molecule effectors of human β-cardiac myosin. We test the top scoring compounds from vHTS in biochemical counter-screens and identify a novel chemical scaffold called 'F10' as a cardiac-specific low-micromolar myosin inhibitor. Biochemical and biophysical characterization in both isolated proteins and muscle fibers show that F10 stabilizes both the biochemical (i.e. super-relaxed state) and structural (i.e. interacting heads motif) OFF state of cardiac myosin, and reduces force and left ventricular pressure development in isolated myofilaments and Langendorff-perfused hearts, respectively. F10 is a tunable scaffold for the further development of a novel class of myosin modulators.",2023-11-24
37998149,A Novel Combination Therapy Tβ4/VIP Protects against Hyperglycemia-Induced Changes in Human Corneal Epithelial Cells.,"Despite the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, the majority of adult diabetic patients develop visually debilitating corneal complications, including impaired wound healing. Unfortunately, there is limited treatment for diabetes-induced corneal damage. The current project investigates a novel, peptide-based combination therapy, thymosin beta-4 and vasoactive intestinal peptide (Tβ4/VIP), against high-glucose-induced damage to the corneal epithelium. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was used for real-time monitoring of barrier function and wound healing of human corneal epithelial cells maintained in either normal glucose (5 mM) or high glucose (25 mM) ± Tβ4 (0.1%) and VIP (5 nM). Barrier integrity was assessed by resistance, impedance, and capacitance measurements. For the wound healing assay, cell migration was also monitored. Corneal epithelial tight junction proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, and claudin-1) were assessed to confirm our findings. Barrier integrity and wound healing were significantly impaired under high-glucose conditions. However, barrier function and cell migration significantly improved with Tβ4/VIP treatment. These findings were supported by high-glucose-induced downregulation of tight junction proteins that were effectively maintained similar to normal levels when treated with Tβ4/VIP. These results strongly support the premise that Tβ4 and VIP work synergistically to protect corneal epithelial cells against hyperglycemia-induced damage. In addition, this work highlights the potential for significant translational impact regarding the treatment of diabetic patients and associated complications of the cornea.",2023-11-07
37995845,Engraulisin: A novel marine derived cell penetrating peptide with activity against drug resistant bacteria.,"Cell penetrating peptides (CPP) with their intrinsic ability to penetrate plasma membranes facilitate intracellular uptake of various macromolecules. Although a substantial number of CPPs have been reported over the last three decades, the number is still inadequate when compared to the theoretically feasible peptides with similar physicochemical composition. Marine organisms, due to their hostile environment, are an immense source of several high-valued therapeutically relevant peptides. Various marine derived antibacterial, antimycotic and anticancer peptides have demonstrated improved activity in comparison to peptides of terrestrial origin. While a significant number of marine bioactive peptides exist, cell penetrating peptides from marine organisms remain unravelled. In this study, we report Engraulisin from Engraulis japonicus, a computationally derived novel cell penetrating peptide of marine origin. Engraulisin manifest successful uptake in mammalian cells at 5 μM concentration with negligible cytotoxicity observed through MTT assay. Analysis of its cellular uptake mechanism revealed significant inhibition at 4 °C suggesting endocytosis as the major route of cellular entry. Interestingly, the novel peptide also demonstrated selective antimicrobial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Additionally, molecular dynamics simulation with POPC and POPG bilayer system unveiled significance of positively charged residues in forming a stable membrane interaction. Engraulisin represents a novel marine-derived cell penetrating peptide which can be explored for cellular delivery of pharmaceutically relevant molecules.",2023-11-22
37989605,Reinforced dentin remineralization via a novel dual-affinity peptide.,"In light of the constantly flowing saliva, anti-caries remineralization agents are inclined to be taken away. Owing to their limited residence time, the remineralization effect is not as desirable as expected. Hence, our study aimed to synthesize a novel peptide (DGP) with high affinity to both collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite, and investigated its dentin remineralization efficacy in vitro and anti-caries capability in vivo.",2023-11-19
37989075,IF-AIP: A machine learning method for the identification of anti-inflammatory peptides using multi-feature fusion strategy.,"The most commonly used therapy currently for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is nonspecific anti-inflammatory drugs, which have various hazardous side effects.

Therefore, the identification of these AIPs is an emerging topic that is equally important.",2023-11-19
37969105,Targeting <i>WNT</i> signalling pathways as new therapeutic strategies for osteoarthritis.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent chronic joint disease and the leading cause of disability. Currently, no drugs are available to control joint damage or ease the associated pain. The <i>wingless-type</i> (<i>WNT</i>) signalling pathway is vital in OA progression. Excessive activation of the <i>WNT</i> signalling pathway is pertinent to OA progression and severity. Therefore, agonists and antagonists of the <i>WNT</i> pathway are considered potential drug candidates for OA treatment. For example, SM04690, a novel small molecule inhibitor of <i>WNT</i> signalling, has demonstrated its potential in a recent phase III clinical trial as a disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug (DMOAD). Therefore, targeting the <i>WNT</i> signalling pathway may be a distinctive approach to developing particular agents helpful in treating OA. This review aims to update the most recent progress in OA drug development by targeting the <i>WNT</i> pathway. In this, we introduce <i>WNT</i> pathways and their crosstalk with other signalling pathways in OA development and highlight the role of the <i>WNT</i> signalling pathway as a key regulator in OA development. Several articles have reviewed the Wnt pathway from different aspects. This candid review provides an introduction to <i>WNT</i> pathways and their crosstalk with other signalling pathways in OA development, highlighting the role of the <i>WNT</i> signalling pathway as a key regulator in OA development with the latest research. Particularly, we emphasise the state-of-the-art in targeting the <i>WNT</i> pathway as a promising therapeutic approach for OA and challenges in their development and the nanocarrier-based delivery of WNT modulators for treating OA.",2023-11-29
37964696,Small-Molecule Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Inducer Triggers Apoptosis in Cancer Cells.,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is highly critical for the sub-cellular protein synthesis, post-translational modifications and myriads of signalling pathways to maintain cellular homeostasis. Consequently, dysregulation in the ER functions leads to the ER stress in different pathological situations including cancer. Hence, exploring small molecules to induce ER stress emerged as one of the unorthodox strategies for future cancer therapeutics. However, development of ER targeted novel small molecules remains elusive due to the dearth of ER targeting moieties. Herein we have synthesized a small library of 3-methoxy-pyrrole-enamine through a concise strategy. Screening of this library in cervical (HeLa), colon (HCT-116), breast (MCF7) and lung cancer (A549) cells identified a novel small molecule which localized into the ER of the HeLa cervical cancer cells within 3 h, induced ER stress through the increased expression of ER stress markers (CHOP, IRE1α, PERK, BiP and Cas-12) and triggered the programmed cell death (apoptosis) leading to remarkable HeLa cell killing. This novel small molecule can be explored further as a tool to understand the chemical biology of ER towards the development of ER targeted cancer therapeutics.",2023-11-30
37962805,Screening and Constructing of Novel Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibiting Peptides from Walnut Protein Isolate and Their Mechanisms of Action: A Merged In Silico and In Vitro Study.,"Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibiting peptides were isolated from walnut protein isolate (WPI) using ultrasound-assisted extraction. This study aimed to assess the impact of ultrasonic pretreatment on the physicochemical properties of WPI. The optimal extraction conditions for WPI were determined as a 15-min ultrasonic treatment at 400 W. Subsequently, the hydrolysate exhibiting the highest in vitro ACE-inhibiting activity underwent further processing and separation steps, including ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, ADMET screening, and molecular docking. As a result of this comprehensive process, two previously unidentified ACE-inhibiting peptides, namely Tyr-Ile-Gln (YIQ) and Ile-Tyr-Gln (IYQ), were identified. In addition, a novel peptide, Ile-Lys-Gln (IKQ), was synthesized, demonstrating superior ACE-inhibiting activity and temperature stability. In silico analysis estimated an in vivo utilization rate of 21.7% for IKQ. These peptides were observed to inhibit ACE through an anti-competitive mechanism, with molecular docking simulations suggesting an interaction mechanism involving hydrogen bonding. Notably, both IYQ and IKQ peptides exhibited no discernible toxicity to HUVECs cells and promoted nitric oxide (NO) generation. These findings underscore the potential of ultrasonicated WPI in the separation of ACE-inhibiting peptides and their utility in the development of novel ACE inhibitors for functional food applications.",2023-11-14
37961202,LOXL2 inhibition ameliorates pulmonary artery remodeling in pulmonary hypertension.,"Conduit pulmonary arterial stiffening and the resultant increase in pulmonary vascular impedance has emerged as an important underlying driver of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

37957274,An immunomodulating peptide with potential to suppress tumour growth and autoimmunity.,"Cancers and autoimmune diseases commonly co-exist and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ICI) exacerbates autoimmune pathologies. We recently described a lipidic peptide, designated IK14004, that promotes expansion of immunosuppressive T regulatory (Treg) cells and uncouples interleukin-2 from interferon-gamma production while activating CD8+ T cells. Herein, we report IK14004-mediated inhibition of Lewis lung cancer (LLC) growth and re-invigoration of splenocyte-derived exhausted CD4+ T cells. In human immune cells from healthy donors, IK14004 modulates expression of the T cell receptor α/β subunits, induces Type I IFN expression, stimulates natural killer (NK) cells to express NKG2D/NKp44 receptors and enhances K562 cytotoxicity. In both T and NK cells, IK14004 alters the IL-12 receptor β1/β2 chain ratio to favour IL-12p70 binding. Taken together, this novel peptide offers an opportunity to gain further insight into the complexity of ICI immunotherapy so that autoimmune responses may be minimised without promoting tumour evasion from the immune system.",2023-11-13
37956803,Assessment of the bound conformation of bombesin to the BB1 and BB2 receptors.,"Bombesin is an endogenous peptide involved in a wide spectrum of physiological activities ranging from satiety, control of circadian rhythm and thermoregulation in the central nervous system, to stimulation of gastrointestinal hormone release, activation of macrophages and effects on development in peripheral tissues. Actions of the peptide are mediated through the two high affinity G-protein coupled receptors BB1R and BB2R. Under pathophysiological conditions, these receptors are overexpressed in many different types of tumors, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, small and non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. This observation has been used for designing cell markers, but it has not been yet exploited for therapeutical purposes. Despite the enormous biological interest of the peptide, little is known about the stereochemical features that contribute to their activity. On the one hand, mutagenesis studies identified a few receptor residues important for high bombesin affinity and on the other, a few studies focused on the relevance of diverse residues of the peptide for receptor activation. Models of the peptide bound to BB1R and BB2R can be helpful to improve our understanding of the stereochemical features granting bombesin activity. Accordingly, the present study describes the computational process followed to construct such models by means of Steered Molecular Dynamics, using models of the peptide and its receptors. Present results provide new insights into the structure-activity relationships of bombesin and its receptors, as well as render an explanation for the differential binding affinity observed towards BB1R and BB2R. Finally, these models can be further exploited to help for designing novel small molecule peptidomimetics with improved pharmacokinetics profile.",2023-11-11

37944847,"Highly potent, orally active novel small-molecule HPK1 inhibitor DS21150768 induces anti-tumor responses in multiple syngeneic tumor mouse models.","Augmenting T-cell activity is a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy treatment. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is predominantly expressed in immune cells and negatively regulates T-cell receptor signaling. It is reported that inhibition of the kinase function of HPK1 results in tumor growth suppression by enhancing cancer immunity. Thus, developing HPK1 inhibitors has attracted considerable attention as a future cancer immunotherapy approach. However, despite recent progress in HPK1 biology and pharmacology, various challenges still remain, such as developing HPK1 inhibitors with favorable pharmacological profiles and identifying tumor characteristics that can be applied to define susceptibility to HPK1 inhibition. Here, we present the identification and pharmacological evaluation of DS21150768, a potent small-molecule HPK1 inhibitor with a novel chemical scaffold. DS21150768 shows remarkable inhibition of HPK1 kinase activity, and in vitro studies demonstrated its potent activity to enhance T-cell function. DS21150768 is orally bioavailable and shows sustained plasma exposure, which leads to enhanced cytokine responses in vivo. We conducted a comparison of the anti-tumor efficacy of DS21150768 alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody in 12 different mouse cancer cell models, and observed that the treatments suppressed tumor growth in multiple models. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis demonstrated significant enrichment of immune-related gene signatures in the tumor models responsive to DS21150768 treatment. Our results provide a path forward for the future development of HPK1 inhibitors and fundamental insights into biomarkers of HPK1-targeted therapy.",2023-11-08
37919545,Clinical Trial Protocol for BEACH: A Phase 2a Study of MW189 in Patients with Acute Nontraumatic Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"Patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) develop secondary neuroinflammation and cerebral edema that can further damage the brain and lead to increased risk of neurologic complications. Preclinical studies in animal models of acute brain injury have shown that a novel small-molecule drug candidate, MW01-6-189WH (MW189), decreases neuroinflammation and cerebral edema and improves functional outcomes. MW189 was also safe and well tolerated in phase 1 studies in healthy adults. The proof-of-concept phase 2a Biomarker and Edema Attenuation in IntraCerebral Hemorrhage (BEACH) clinical trial is a first-in-patient, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It is designed to determine the safety and tolerability of MW189 in patients with acute ICH, identify trends in potential mitigation of neuroinflammation and cerebral edema, and assess effects on functional outcomes. A total of 120 participants with nontraumatic ICH will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive intravenous MW189 (0.25 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) within 24 h of symptom onset and every 12 h for up to 5 days or until hospital discharge. The 120-participant sample size (60 per group) will allow testing of the null hypothesis of noninferiority with a tolerance limit of 12% and assuming a ""worst-case"" safety assumption of 10% rate of death in each arm with 10% significance and 80% power. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at 7 days post randomization between treatment arms. Secondary end points include all-cause mortality at 30 days, perihematomal edema volume after symptom onset, adverse events, vital signs, pharmacokinetics of MW189, and inflammatory cytokine concentrations in plasma (and cerebrospinal fluid if available). Other exploratory end points are functional outcomes collected on days 30, 90, and 180. BEACH will provide important information about the utility of targeting neuroinflammation in ICH and will inform the design of future larger trials of acute central nervous system injury.",2023-11-02

37897912,A GPX4 non-enzymatic domain and MDM2 targeting peptide PROTAC for acute lymphoid leukemia therapy through ferroptosis induction.,"Ferroptosis, an emerging form of programmed cell death, has garnered substantial attention as a potential target for cancer therapy. However, despite the potential promise, no ferroptosis-related therapies have progressed to clinical trials. Identifying disease types sensitive to ferroptosis and developing specific ferroptosis-targeting drugs are critical focal points in the field of ferroptosis-based treatment. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive database analysis and presented compelling evidence indicating a high expression of GPX4 in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), significantly correlating with poor prognosis. Notably, elevated GPX4 expression is closely associated with ALL relapse, a major challenge in the treatment of this disease. Building upon these findings, we devised a novel peptide-based Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC) drug targeting GPX4 through computer-aided design. In contrast to existing drugs that target the conjugative enzyme active site, our design focused on a peptide drug targeting the non-active site of GPX4. Furthermore, we strategically selected MDM2, an E3 ligase highly expressed in ALL, for the PROTAC drug design. This deliberate choice amplifies the drug's effect on cancer cells while minimizing its impact on normal cells, achieving desirable selectivity for cancer cells. Leveraging nanogold delivery, we successfully facilitated intracellular action of the GPX4-targeting peptide PROTAC drug, denoted as Au-PGPD (peptide GPX4 PROTAC drug). Au-PGPD effectively induced GPX4 degradation and inhibited ALL cell proliferation. Remarkably, Au-PGPD exhibited significantly less efficacy on normal cells, underscoring the selectivity and safety of our design.",2023-10-20
37892227,NanoFIRE: A NanoLuciferase and Fluorescent Integrated Reporter Element for Robust and Sensitive Investigation of HIF and Other Signalling Pathways.,"The Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) transcription factors are imperative for cell adaption to low oxygen conditions and development; however, they also contribute to ischaemic disease and cancer. To identify novel genetic regulators which target the HIF pathway or small molecules for therapeutic use, cell-based reporter systems are commonly used. Here, we present a new, highly sensitive and versatile reporter system, NanoFIRE: a NanoLuciferase and Fluorescent Integrated Reporter Element. Under the control of a Hypoxic Response Element (HRE-NanoFIRE), this system is a robust sensor of HIF activity within cells and potently responds to both hypoxia and chemical inducers of the HIF pathway in a highly reproducible and sensitive manner, consistently achieving 20 to 150-fold induction across different cell types and a Z' score > 0.5. We demonstrate that the NanoFIRE system is adaptable via substitution of the response element controlling NanoLuciferase and show that it can report on the activity of the transcriptional regulator Factor Inhibiting HIF, and an unrelated transcription factor, the Progesterone Receptor. Furthermore, the lentivirus-mediated stable integration of NanoFIRE highlights the versatility of this system across a wide range of cell types, including primary cells. Together, these findings demonstrate that NanoFIRE is a robust reporter system for the investigation of HIF and other transcription factor-mediated signalling pathways in cells, with applications in high throughput screening for the identification of novel small molecule and genetic regulators.",2023-10-19
37888457,Affinity Purification and Molecular Characterization of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)-Inhibitory Peptides from <i>Takifugu flavidus</i>.,"An affinity chromatography filler of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B-immobilized ACE was used to purify ACE-inhibitory peptides from <i>Takifugu flavidus</i> protein hydrolysate (<1 kDa). Twenty-four peptides with an average local confidence score (ALC) ≥ 80% from bounded components (eluted by 1 M NaCl) were identified by LC-MS/MS. Among them, a novel peptide, TLRFALHGME, with ACE-inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 93.5 µmol·L<sup>-1</sup>) was selected. Molecular docking revealed that TLRFALHGME may interact with the active site of ACE through H-bond, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions. The total binding energy (ΔGbinding) of TLRFALHGME was estimated to be -82.7382 kJ·mol<sup>-1</sup> by MD simulations, indicating the favorable binding of peptides with ACE.

37888438,Marine Invertebrate Antimicrobial Peptides and Their Potential as Novel Peptide Antibiotics.,"Marine invertebrates constantly interact with a wide range of microorganisms in their aquatic environment and possess an effective defense system that has enabled their existence for millions of years. Their lack of acquired immunity sets marine invertebrates apart from other marine animals. Invertebrates could rely on their innate immunity, providing the first line of defense, survival, and thriving. The innate immune system of marine invertebrates includes various biologically active compounds, and specifically, antimicrobial peptides. Nowadays, there is a revive of interest in these peptides due to the urgent need to discover novel drugs against antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, a pressing global concern in modern healthcare. Modern technologies offer extensive possibilities for the development of innovative drugs based on these compounds, which can act against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. This review focuses on structural peculiarities, biological functions, gene expression, biosynthesis, mechanisms of antimicrobial action, regulatory activities, and prospects for the therapeutic use of antimicrobial peptides derived from marine invertebrates.",2023-09-23
37886595,Therapeutic Intervention of Neuroinflammatory Alzheimer Disease Model by Inhibition of Classical Complement Pathway with the Use of Anti-C1r Loaded Exosomes.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease associated with memory decline, cognitive impairment, amyloid plaque formation and tau tangles. Neuroinflammation has been shown to be a precursor to apparent amyloid plaque accumulation and subsequent synaptic loss and cognitive decline. In this study, the ability of a novel, small molecule, T-ALZ01, to inhibit neuroinflammatory processes was analyzed. T-ALZ01, an inhibitor of complement component C1r, demonstrated a significant reduction in the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α <i>in vitro</i>. An LPS-induced animal model, whereby animals were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 mg/kg LPS, was used to analyze the effect of T-ALZ01 on neuroinflammation <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, exosomes (nanosized, endogenous extracellular vehicles) were used as drug delivery vehicles to facilitate intranasal administration of T-ALZ01 across the blood-brain barrier. T-ALZ01 demonstrated significant reduction in degenerating neurons and the activation of resident microglia and astrocytes, as well as inflammatory markers <i>in vivo</i>. This study demonstrates a significant use of small molecule complement inhibitors via exosome drug delivery as a possible therapeutic in disorders characterized by neuroinflammation, such AD.",2023-10-18

37874823,A mechanistically novel peptide agonist of the IL-7 receptor that addresses limitations of IL-7 cytokine therapy.,"Interleukin (IL)-7 is broadly active on T-cell populations, and modified versions have been clinically evaluated for a variety of therapeutic applications, including cancer, lymphopenia, and infectious diseases; and found to be relatively well-tolerated and biologically active. Here we describe novel IL-7R agonists that are unrelated in structure to IL-7, bind to the receptor subunits differently from IL-7, but closely emulate IL-7 biology. The small size, low structural complexity, and the natural amino acid composition of the pharmacologically active peptide MDK1472 allows facile incorporation into protein structures, such as the IgG2-Fc fusion MDK-703. This molecule possesses properties potentially better suited to therapeutic applications than native IL-7 or its derivatives. We compared these compounds with IL-7 for immune cell selectivity, induction of IL-7R signaling, receptor-mediated internalization, proliferation, and generation of immune cell phenotypes in human and non-human primate (NHP) peripheral blood cells in vitro; and found them to be similar in biological activity to IL-7. In cynomolgus macaques, MDK-703 exhibits a circulating half-life of 46 hr and produces sustained T-cell expansion characteristic of IL-7 treatment. In the huCD34+-engrafted NSG mouse model of the human immune system, MDK-703 induces an immune cell profile very similar to that generated by IL-7-derived compounds; including the pronounced expansion of memory T-cells, particularly the population of stem-like memory T-cells (Tscm) which may be important for anti-tumor activities reported with IL-7 treatment. Clinical administration of IL-7 and modified variants has been reported to induce anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), including IL-7 neutralizing antibodies. The novel peptide agonist reported here scores very low in predicted immunogenicity, and because the peptide lacks sequence similarity with IL-7, the problematic immunogenic neutralization of endogenous cytokine should not occur. The properties we report here implicate MDK-703 as a candidate for clinical evaluation in oncology, anti-viral and other infectious disease, vaccine enhancement, and treatment of lymphopenia.",2023-10-24
37873470,Elucidating Compound Mechanism of Action and Polypharmacology with a Large-scale Perturbational Profile Compendium.,"The Mechanism of Action (MoA) of a drug is generally represented as a small, non-tissue-specific repertoire of high-affinity binding targets. Yet, drug activity and polypharmacology are increasingly associated with a broad range of off-target and tissue-specific effector proteins. To address this challenge, we have leveraged a microfluidics-based Plate-Seq technology to survey drug perturbational profiles representing >700 FDA-approved and experimental oncology drugs, in cell lines selected as high-fidelity models of 23 aggressive tumor subtypes. Built on this dataset, we implemented an efficient computational framework to define a tissue-specific protein activity landscape of these drugs and reported almost 50 million differential protein activities derived from drug perturbations <i>vs.</i> vehicle controls. These analyses revealed thousands of highly reproducible and novel, drug-mediated modulation of tissue-specific targets, leading to generation of a proteome-wide drug functional network, characterization of MoA-related drug clusters and off-target effects, dramatical expansion of druggable human proteome, and identification and experimental validation of novel, tissue-specific inhibitors of undruggable oncoproteins, most never reported before. The drug perturbation profile resource described here represents the first, large-scale, whole-genome-wide, RNA-Seq based dataset assembled to date, with the proposed framework, which is easily extended to elucidating the MoA of novel small-molecule libraries, facilitates mechanistic exploration of drug functions, supports systematic and quantitative approaches to precision oncology, and serves as a rich data foundation for drug discovery.",2024-06-27
37865992,Discovery of tetrazolo-pyridazine-based small molecules as inhibitors of MACC1-driven cancer metastasis.,"Metastasis is directly linked to poor prognosis of cancer patients and warrants search for effective anti-metastatic drugs. MACC1 is a causal key molecule for metastasis. High MACC1 expression is prognostic for metastasis and poor survival. Here, we developed novel small molecule inhibitors targeting MACC1 expression to impede metastasis formation. We performed a human MACC1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter-based high-throughput screen (HTS; 118.500 compound library) to identify MACC1 transcriptional inhibitors. HTS revealed 1,2,3,4-tetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-based compounds as efficient transcriptional inhibitors of MACC1 expression, able to decrease MACC1-induced cancer cell motility in vitro. Structure-activity relationships identified the essential inhibitory core structure. Best candidates were evaluated for metastasis inhibition in xenografted mouse models demonstrating metastasis restriction. ADMET showed high drug-likeness of these new candidates for cancer therapy. The NFκB pathway was identified as one mode of action targeted by these compounds. Taken together, 1,2,3,4-tetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazine-based compounds are effective MACC1 inhibitors and pose promising candidates for anti-metastatic therapies particularly for patients with MACC1-overexpressing cancers, that are at high risk to develop metastases. Although further preclinical and clinical development is necessary, these compounds represent important building blocks for an individualized anti-metastatic therapy for solid cancers.",2023-10-21
37864629,AQP4 is an Emerging Regulator of Pathological Pain: A Narrative Review.,"Pathological pain presents significant challenges in clinical practice and research. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which is primarily found in astrocytes, is being considered as a prospective modulator of pathological pain. This review examines the association between AQP4 and pain-related diseases, including cancer pain, neuropathic pain, and inflammatory pain. In cancer pain, upregulated AQP4 expression in tumor cells is linked to increased pain severity, potentially through tumor-induced inflammation and edema. Targeting AQP4 may offer therapeutic strategies for managing cancer pain. AQP4 has also been found to play a role in nerve damage. Changes in AQP4 expression have been detected in pain-related regions of the brain and spinal cord; thus, modulating AQP4 expression or function may provide new avenues for treating neuropathic pain. Of note, AQP4-deficient mice exhibit reduced chronic pain responses, suggesting potential involvement of AQP4 in chronic pain modulation, and AQP4 is involved in pain modulation during inflammation, so understanding AQP4-mediated pain modulation may lead to novel anti-inflammatory and analgesic therapies. Recent advancements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques enable assessment of AQP4 expression and localization, contributing to our understanding of its involvement in brain edema and clearance pathways related to pathological pain. Furthermore, targeting AQP4 through gene therapies and small-molecule modulators shows promise as a potential therapeutic intervention. Future research should focus on utilizing advanced MRI techniques to observe glymphatic system changes and the exchange of cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid. Additionally, investigating the regulation of AQP4 by non-coding RNAs and exploring novel small-molecule medicines are important directions for future research. This review shed light on AQP4-based innovative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pathological pain.

37859283,Transcriptomic discovery of a theranostic signature (SERPINE1/MMP3/COL1A1/SPP1) for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and identification of antrocinol as a candidate drug.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are prevalent malignancies with a disappointing prognosis, necessitating the search for theranostic biomarkers for better management. Based on a meta-analysis of transcriptomic data containing ten clinical datasets of HNSCC and matched nonmalignant samples, we identified SERPINE1/MMP3/COL1A1/SPP1 as essential hub genes as the potential theranostic biomarkers. Our analysis suggests these hub genes are associated with the extracellular matrix, peptidoglycans, cell migration, wound-healing processes, complement and coagulation cascades, and the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway within the tumor microenvironment. Also, these hub genes were associated with tumor-immune infiltrating cells and immunosuppressive phenotypes of HNSCC. Further investigation of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts revealed that these hub genes were associated with staging, metastasis, and poor survival in HNSCC patients. Molecular docking simulations were performed to evaluate binding activities between the hub genes and antrocinol, a novel small-molecule derivative of an anticancer phytochemical antrocin previously discovered by our group. Antrocinol showed high affinities to MMP3 and COL1A1. Notably, antrocinol presented satisfactory drug-like and ADMET properties for therapeutic applications. These results hinted at the potential of antrocinol as an anti-HNSCC candidate via targeting MMP3 and COL1A1. In conclusion, we identified hub genes: SERPINE1/MMP3/COL1A1/SPP1 as potential diagnostic biomarkers and antrocinol as a potential new drug for HNSCC.",2022-10-17
37857609,Astragaloside IV derivative HHQ16 ameliorates infarction-induced hypertrophy and heart failure through degradation of lncRNA4012/9456.,"Reversing ventricular remodeling represents a promising treatment for the post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure (HF). Here, we report a novel small molecule HHQ16, an optimized derivative of astragaloside IV, which effectively reversed infarction-induced myocardial remodeling and improved cardiac function by directly acting on the cardiomyocyte to reverse hypertrophy. The effect of HHQ16 was associated with a strong inhibition of a newly discovered Egr2-affiliated transcript lnc9456 in the heart. While minimally expressed in normal mouse heart, lnc9456 was dramatically upregulated in the heart subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery ligation (LADL) and in cardiomyocytes subjected to hypertrophic stimulation. The critical role of lnc9456 in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was confirmed by specific overexpression and knockout in vitro. A physical interaction between lnc9456 and G3BP2 increased NF-κB nuclear translocation, triggering hypertrophy-related cascades. HHQ16 physically bound to lnc9456 with a high-affinity and induced its degradation. Cardiomyocyte-specific lnc9456 overexpression induced, but knockout prevented LADL-induced, cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. HHQ16 reversed the effect of lnc9456 overexpression while lost its protective role when lnc9456 was deleted, further confirming lnc9456 as the bona fide target of HHQ16. We further identified the human ortholog of lnc9456, also an Egr2-affiliated transcript, lnc4012. Similarly, lnc4012 was significantly upregulated in hypertrophied failing hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. HHQ16 also specifically bound to lnc4012 and caused its degradation and antagonized its hypertrophic effects. Targeted degradation of pathological increased lnc4012/lnc9456 by small molecules might serve as a novel promising strategy to regress infarction-induced cardiac hypertrophy and HF.",2023-10-19
37855364,Identification of novel small molecule inhibitors for solute carrier SGLT1; a computational exploration.,"Diabetes results in substantial disabilities, diminished quality of life, and mortality that imposes a huge economic burden on societies and governments worldwide. Despite the absence of specific oral therapies at present, there exists an urgent requirement to develop a novel drug for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The membrane protein sodium glucose co-transporters (SGLT1) present a captivating therapeutic target for diabetes, given its pivotal role in facilitating glucose absorption in the small intestine, offering immense promise for potential therapeutic intervention. In this connection, the present study is aimed at identifying potential inhibitors of SGLT1 from a small molecule database, including compounds from both natural as well as synthetic origins. A comprehensive approach was employed, by integrating homology modeling, ligand-based pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, and molecular docking simulation. The process resulted in the identification of 16 new compounds, featuring similar attributes as observed for the documented actives. In a systematic screening procedure, five potential virtual hits were selected for simulation studies followed by subsequent binding free energy calculations, providing deeper insight into the time-dependent behavior of protein-ligand complexes in a dynamic state. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that the identified compounds, particularly <b>compounds 81</b> and <b>91</b>, exhibit enhanced stability and favorable binding affinities with the target protein, marking them promising candidates for further investigations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

37849662,"Clinical Peptidomics: Advances in Instrumentation, Analyses, and Applications.","Extensive effort has been devoted to the discovery, development, and validation of biomarkers for early disease diagnosis and prognosis as well as rapid evaluation of the response to therapeutic interventions. Genomic and transcriptomic profiling are well-established means to identify disease-associated biomarkers. However, analysis of disease-associated peptidomes can also identify novel peptide biomarkers or signatures that provide sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic information for specific malignant, chronic, and infectious diseases. Growing evidence also suggests that peptidomic changes in liquid biopsies may more effectively detect changes in disease pathophysiology than other molecular methods. Knowledge gained from peptide-based diagnostic, therapeutic, and imaging approaches has led to promising new theranostic applications that can increase their bioavailability in target tissues at reduced doses to decrease side effects and improve treatment responses. However, despite major advances, multiple factors can still affect the utility of peptidomic data.

37845748,A novel highly selective allosteric inhibitor of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) can block inflammation- and autoimmune-related pathways.,"As a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, which includes JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) plays an important role in signal transduction and immune system regulation. Moreover, it is also involved in the development of many types of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). TYK2 is an attractive therapeutic target, and selective inhibition of TYK2 over other JAK family members is critical for the development of TYK2 small molecule inhibitors. However, targeting the catalytic region of the TYK2 ATP-binding site is a major challenge due to the high structural homology between the catalytic regions of the JAK family proteins.",2023-10-16
37841588,Development of novel cytoprotective small compounds inhibiting mitochondria-dependent cell death.,"We identified cytoprotective small molecules (CSMs) by a cell-based high-throughput screening of Bax inhibitors. Through a medicinal chemistry program, M109S was developed, which is orally bioactive and penetrates the blood-brain/retina barriers. M109S protected retinal cells in ocular disease mouse models. M109S directly interacted with Bax and inhibited the conformational change and mitochondrial translocation of Bax. M109S inhibited ABT-737-induced apoptosis both in Bax-only and Bak-only mouse embryonic fibroblasts. M109S also inhibited apoptosis induced by staurosporine, etoposide, and obatoclax. M109S decreased maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and reactive oxygen species production, whereas it increased glycolysis. These effects on cellular metabolism may contribute to the cytoprotective activity of M109S. M109S is a novel small molecule protecting cells from mitochondria-dependent apoptosis both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. M109S has the potential to become a research tool for studying cell death mechanisms and to develop therapeutics targeting mitochondria-dependent cell death pathway.",2023-09-17
37830254,Development and application of novel peptide-formulated nanoparticles for treatment of atopic dermatitis.,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by skin inflammation, itching, and redness. Although various treatments can alleviate symptoms, they often come with side effects, highlighting the need for new treatments. Here, we discovered a new peptide-based therapy using the intra-dermal delivery technology (IDDT) platform developed by Remedi Co., Ltd (REMEDI). The platform screens and identifies peptides derived from proteins in the human body that possess cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) properties. We screened over 1000-peptides and identified several derived from the Speckled protein (SP) family that have excellent CPP properties and have anti-inflammatory effects. We assessed these peptides for their potential as a treatment for atopic dermatitis. Among them, the RMSP1 peptide showed the most potent anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathways while possessing CPP properties. To further improve efficacy and stability, we developed a palmitoylated version called Pal-RMSP1. Formulation studies using liposomes (Pal-RMSP1 LP) and micelles (Pal-RMSP1 DP) demonstrated improved anti-inflammatory effects <i>in vitro</i> and enhanced therapeutic effects <i>in vivo</i>. Our study indicates that nano-formulated Pal-RMSP1 could have the potential to become a new treatment option for atopic dermatitis.",2023-11-01
37829571,A Novel Peptide that Disrupts the Lck-IP<sub>3</sub>R Protein-Protein Interaction Induces Widespread Cell Death in Leukemia and Lymphoma.,"There is increasing evidence that the T-cell protein, Lck, is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as well as other leukemias and lymphomas. We previously discovered that Lck binds to domain 5 of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>R) to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Using bioinformatics, we targeted a region within domain 5 of IP<sub>3</sub>R-1 predicted to facilitate protein-protein interactions (PPIs). We generated a synthetic 21 amino acid peptide, KKRMDLVLELKNNASKLLLAI, which constitutes a domain 5 sub-domain (D5SD) of IP<sub>3</sub>R-1 that specifically binds Lck via its SH2 domain. With the addition of an HIV-TAT sequence to enable cell permeability of D5SD peptide, we observed wide-spread, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, cell killing of hematological cancer cells when the Lck-IP<sub>3</sub>R PPI was disrupted by TAT-D5SD. All cell lines and primary cells were sensitive to D5SD peptide, but malignant T-cells were less sensitive compared with B-cell or myeloid malignancies. Mining of RNA-seq data showed that <i>LCK</i> was expressed in primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In fact, <i>LCK</i> shows a similar pattern of expression as many well-characterized AML oncogenes and is part of a protein interactome that includes FLT3-ITD, Notch-1, and Kit. Consistent with these findings, our data suggest that the Lck-IP<sub>3</sub>R PPI may protect malignant hematopoietic cells from death. Importantly, TAT-D5SD showed no cytotoxicity in three different non-hematopoietic cell lines; thus its ability to induce cell death appears specific to hematopoietic cells. Together, these data show that a peptide designed to disrupt the Lck-IP<sub>3</sub>R PPI has a wide range of pre-clinical activity in leukemia and lymphoma.",2023-08-30

Here, we have synthesized a small molecule compound S-342-3, which exhibits potent inhibition of biofilm formation in both MRSA and MSSA. Further investigations revealed that S-342-3 exerts inhibitory effects on biofilm formation by reducing the production of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin and preventing bacterial adhesion. Our study has confirmed that the inhibitory effect of S-342-3 on biofilm is achieved by downregulating the expression of genes responsible for biofilm formation. In addition, S-342-3 is non-toxic to <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae and A549 cells. Consequently, this study demonstrates the efficacy of a biologically safe compound S-342-3 in inhibiting biofilm formation in <i>S. aureus,</i> thereby providing a promising antibiofilm agent for further research.",2023-10-11
37799576,Resistance is futile: targeting multidrug-resistant bacteria with <i>de novo</i> Cys-rich cyclic polypeptides.,"The search for novel antimicrobial agents to combat microbial pathogens is intensifying in response to rapid drug resistance development to current antibiotic therapeutics. The use of disulfide-rich head-to-tail cyclized polypeptides as molecular frameworks for designing a new type of peptide antibiotics is gaining increasing attention among the scientific community and the pharmaceutical industry. The use of macrocyclic peptides, further constrained by the presence of several disulfide bonds, makes these peptide frameworks remarkably more stable to thermal, biological, and chemical degradation showing better activities when compared to their linear analogs. Many of these novel peptide scaffolds have been shown to have a high tolerance to sequence variability in those residues not involved in disulfide bonds, able to cross biological membranes, and efficiently target complex biomolecular interactions. Hence, these unique properties make the use of these scaffolds ideal for many biotechnological applications, including the design of novel peptide antibiotics. This article provides an overview of the new developments in the use of several disulfide-rich cyclic polypeptides, including cyclotides, θ-defensins, and sunflower trypsin inhibitor peptides, among others, in the development of novel antimicrobial peptides against multidrug-resistant bacteria.",2023-08-21

37779969,Therapeutic Potential of Antiviral Peptides against the NS2B/NS3 Protease of Zika Virus.,"The NS2B/NS3 protease is highly conserved among various proteases of the Zika virus, making it an important therapeutic target for developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. The NS2B/NS3 protease is a crucial enzyme in the replication cycle of Zika virus and plays a significant role in viral maturation and assembly. Inhibiting the activity of this protease can potentially prevent viral replication, making it an attractive target for developing therapies against Zika virus infection. This work screens 429 antiviral peptides in comparison with substrate peptide against the NS2B/NS3 of Zika virus using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Based on the docking screening, MD simulation conducted for the best four peptides including AVP0239, AVP0642, AVP0660, and AVP2044, could be effective against NS2B/NS3. These results were compared with the control substrate peptide. Further analysis indicates that AVP0642 and AVP2044 are the most promising candidates. The interaction analysis showed that the catalytic site residues including His51, Asp75, Ser135 and other non-catalytic residues such as Asp129, Asp83, and Asp79 contribute substantial interactions. Hydrogen bonds (41%) and hydrophobic interactions (33%) are observed as the prominent non-covalent interaction prompting the peptide-protein complex formation. Furthermore, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) illustrates that positively charged (Lys, Arg) residues in the peptides dominate the interactions. This study provides the basis for developing novel peptide-based protease inhibitors for Zika virus.",2023-09-13
37763279,Antimicrobial Peptides: The Production of Novel Peptide-Based Therapeutics in Plant Systems.,"The increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance is alarming and has a significant impact on the economies of emerging and underdeveloped nations.

37762381,The Anti-Caries Effects of a Novel Peptide on Dentine Caries: An In Vitro Study.,"This study aimed to investigate the antibiofilm and remineralising effects of peptide GAPI on artificial dentin caries. After creating artificial carious lesions, eighty dentine blocks were randomly assigned for treatment twice daily with GAPI (GAPI group) or deionised water (control group). Both groups underwent a 7-day biochemical cycle. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed <i>S. mutans</i> with damaged structures that partially covered the dentine in the GAPI group. The dead-live ratios for the GAPI and control groups were 0.77 ± 0.13 and 0.37 ± 0.09 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The log colony-forming units for the GAPI and control groups were 7.45 ± 0.32 and 8.74 ± 0.50 (<i>p</i> < 0.001), respectively. The lesion depths for the GAPI and control groups were 151 ± 18 µm and 214 ± 15 µm (<i>p</i> < 0.001), respectively. The mineral losses for the GAPI and control groups were 0.91 ± 0.07 gHAcm<sup>-3</sup> and 1.01 ± 0.07 gHAcm<sup>-3</sup> (<i>p</i> = 0.01), respectively. The hydrogen-to-amide I ratios for the GAPI and control groups were 2.92 ± 0.82 and 1.83 ± 0.73 (<i>p</i> = 0.014), respectively. SEM micrographs revealed fewer exposed dentine collagen fibres in the GAPI group compared to those in the control group. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicated that the hydroxyapatite in the GAPI group was more crystallised than that in the control group. This study demonstrated GAPI's antibiofilm and remineralising effects on artificial dentin caries.",2023-09-14

Inhibition of CDC7 in cancer cells causes lethal S phase or M phase progression, whereas inhibition of CDC7 in normal cells does not cause cell death and only leads to cell cycle arrest at the DNA replication checkpoint. Therefore, CDC7 has been recognized as a potential target for novel therapeutic interventions in cancers.",2023-11-06
37728236,"Discovery of a Druggable, Cryptic Pocket in SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 Using Allosteric Inhibitors.","A collaborative, open-science team undertook discovery of novel small molecule inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp16-nsp10 2'-<i>O</i>-methyltransferase using a high throughput screening approach with the potential to reveal new inhibition strategies. This screen yielded compound <b>5a</b>, a ligand possessing an electron-deficient double bond, as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 activity. Surprisingly, X-ray crystal structures revealed that <b>5a</b> covalently binds within a previously unrecognized cryptic pocket near the <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine binding cleft in a manner that prevents occupation by <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we examined the mechanism of binding of compound <b>5a</b> to the nsp16 cryptic pocket and developed <b>5a</b> derivatives that inhibited nsp16 activity and murine hepatitis virus replication in rat lung epithelial cells but proved cytotoxic to cell lines canonically used to examine SARS-CoV-2 infection.

37720348,Nuclear epidermal growth factor receptor as a therapeutic target.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the most well-studied oncogenes with roles in proliferation, growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. This intense study has led to the development of a range of targeted therapeutics including small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), monoclonal antibodies, and nanobodies. These drugs are excellent at blocking the activation and kinase function of wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR) and several common EGFR mutants. These drugs have significantly improved outcomes for patients with cancers including head and neck, glioblastoma, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, therapeutic resistance is often seen, resulting from acquired mutations or activation of compensatory signaling pathways. Additionally, these therapies are ineffective in tumors where EGFR is found predominantly in the nucleus, as can be found in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In TNBC, EGFR is subjected to alternative trafficking which drives the nuclear localization of the receptor. In the nucleus, EGFR interacts with several proteins to activate transcription, DNA repair, migration, and chemoresistance. Nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) correlates with metastatic disease and worse patient prognosis yet targeting its nuclear localization has proved difficult. This review provides an overview of current EGFR-targeted therapies and novel peptide-based therapies that block nEGFR, as well as their clinical applications and potential for use in oncology.",2023-08-30
37717381,A dipyridophenazine Ni(II) dithiolene complex as a dual-acting cancer phototherapy agent activatable within the phototherapeutic window.,"A combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) within the phototherapeutic window (600-900 nm) can lead to significantly enhanced therapeutic outcomes, surpassing the efficacy observed with PDT or PTT alone in cancer phototherapy. Herein, we report a novel small-molecule mixed-ligand Ni(II)-dithiolene complex (Ni-TDD) with a dipyridophenazine ligand, demonstrating potent red-light PDT and significant near-infrared (NIR) light mild-temperature PTT activity against cancer cells and 3D multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTSs). The four-coordinate square planar complex exhibited a moderately intense absorption band (ε ∼ 3700 M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>) centered around 900 nm and demonstrated excellent dark and photostability in an aqueous phase. Ni-TDD induced a potent red-light (600-720 nm) PDT effect on HeLa cancer cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.8 μM, photo irritation factor = 44), triggering apoptotic cell death through efficient singlet oxygen generation. Ni-TDD showed a significant intercalative binding affinity towards double-helical calf thymus DNA, resulting in a binding constant (K<sub>b</sub>) ∼ 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>. The complex induced mild hyperthermia and exerted a significant mild-temperature PTT effect on MDA-MB-231 cancer cells upon irradiation with 808 nm NIR light. Simultaneous irradiation of Ni-TDD-treated HeLa MCTSs with red and NIR light led to a remarkable synergistic inhibition of growth, exceeding the effects of individual irradiation, through the generation of singlet oxygen and mild hyperthermia. Ni-TDD displayed minimal toxicity towards non-cancerous HPL1D and L929 cells, even at high micromolar concentrations. This is the first report of a Ni(II) complex demonstrating red-light PDT activity and the first example of a first-row transition metal complex exhibiting combined PDT and PTT effects within the clinically relevant phototherapeutic window. Our findings pave the way for designing and developing metal-dithiolene complexes as dual-acting cancer phototherapy agents using long wavelength light for treating solid tumors.",2023-09-12
37716621,The novel small molecule BH3 mimetic nobiletin synergizes with vorinostat to induce apoptosis and autophagy in small cell lung cancer.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal subtype of lung cancer with few therapeutic options; therefore, the identification of new targets and drugs with potent combination therapy is desirable. We previously screened BH3 mimetics from a natural product library, and in this study, we validated nobiletin as a BH3 mimetic. Specifically, we observed its combination potential and mechanism with vorinostat in SCLC in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that combination treatment with nobiletin and vorinostat reduced the proliferation of SCLC H82 cells and increased the levels of apoptotic proteins such as cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP. The combination treatment increased LC3-II expression and induced autophagic cell death. In addition, this treatment significantly inhibited H82 cell xenograft SCLC tumor growth in nude mice. The combination treatment with nobiletin and vorinostat efficiently increased autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and promoting dissociation of the BCL-2 and Beclin 1 complex, increasing the level of isolated Beclin 1 to stimulate autophagy. Molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that nobiletin stably bound to the BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 proteins with high affinity in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that nobiletin is a BH3-only protein mimetic. Furthermore, the combination of nobiletin with vorinostat increased histone H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation levels in SCLC mouse tumor tissue and enhanced the expression of the BH3-only proteins BIM and BID. We conclude that nobiletin is a novel natural BH3 mimetic that can cooperate with vorinostat to induce apoptosis and autophagy in SCLC.",2023-09-15
37716012,Self-Adaptive Nanoregulator to Mitigate Dynamic Immune Evasion of Pancreatic Cancer.,"The advance of immunotherapy has shifted the paradigm of cancer management in clinics. Nevertheless, a considerable subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients marginally respond to current immunotherapy due to the occurrence of dynamic immune evasion arising from intrinsic and therapeutic stress. In this investigation, the pivotal role of pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-induced fibrosis and tumor cell-mediated T-cell exhaustion in driving the dynamic immune evasion is identified. Building upon this discovery, the authors herein engineer a novel peptide-drug conjugate (PDC)-based self-adaptive nanoregulator for mitigating dynamic immune evasion of PDAC. The resulting nanoregulator can perform a two-stage morphology transformation from spherical micelle to nanofiber, and subsequently from nanofiber to spherical nanoparticles. Such kind of nanostructure design can facilitate differentialized delivery of CAF inhibitor in the extracellular matrix for intervening CAF-mediated tumor fibrosis, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 inhibitor to tumor cells for relieving IDO1-kynurenine axis-induced T-cell exhaustion. Antitumor study with the self-adaptive nanoregulator elicited persistent antitumor immunity and remarkable antitumor performance in both Panc02 and KPC tumor models in vivo. Taken together, the PDC-based self-adaptive nanoregulator may provide a novel avenue for enhanced PDAC immunotherapy.",2023-10-18
37696461,Small-molecule drugs of colorectal cancer: Current status and future directions.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the world's fourth most deadly cancer. CRC, as a genetic susceptible disease, faces significant challenges in optimizing prognosis through optimal drug treatment modalities. In recent decades, the development of innovative small-molecule drugs is expected to provide targeted interventions that accurately address the different molecular characteristics of CRC. Although the clinical application of single-target drugs is limited by the heterogeneity and high metastasis of CRC, novel small-molecule drug treatment strategies such as dual/multiple-target drugs, drug repurposing, and combination therapies can help overcome these challenges and provide new insights for improving CRC treatment. In this review, we focus on the current status of a range of small molecule drugs that are being considered for CRC therapy, including single-target drugs, dual/multiple-target drugs, drug repurposing and combination strategies, which will pave the way for targeting CRC vulnerabilities with small-molecule drugs in future personalized treatment.",2023-09-09
37696459,Development of a novel peptide targeting GPR81 to suppress adipocyte-mediated tumor progression.,"GPR81, initially discovered in adipocytes, has been found to suppress lipolysis when activated. However, the current small molecules that target GPR81 carry the risk of off-target effects, and their impact on tumor progression remains uncertain. Here, we utilized phage display technology to screen a GPR81-targeting peptide named 7w-2 and proceeded to demonstrate its bioactivity. Although 7w-2 did not affect the proliferation of tumor cells, it effectively reduced adipocyte catabolism in vitro, consequently restraining the proliferation of co-cultured tumor cells. Furthermore, our findings revealed that 7w-2 could inhibit lipolysis in vivo, leading to a significant impediment in tumor growth and metastasis in the 4T1 murine tumor model. Additionally, 7w-2 exhibited the ability to significantly elevate the proportion and functionality of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our study introduces 7w-2 as the first peptide targeting GPR81, shedding light on its potential role in adipocytes in suppressing tumor progression.",2023-09-09
37690388,Novel small molecule-mediated restoration of the surface expression and anion exchange activity of mutated pendrin causing Pendred syndrome and DFNB4.,"Variants in SLC26A4 (pendrin) are the most common reasons for genetic hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in East Asians. In patients with Pendred syndrome and DFNB4 (autosomal recessive type of genetic hearing loss 4), caused by variants in SLC26A4, the hearing function is residual at birth and deteriorates over several years, with no curative treatment for these disorders. In the present study, we revealed that a novel small molecule restores the expression and function of mutant pendrin. High-throughput screening of 54,000 small molecules was performed. We observed that pendrin corrector (PC2-1) increased the surface expression and anion exchange activity of p.H723R pendrin (H723R-PDS), the most prevalent genetic variant that causes Pendred syndrome and DFNB4. Furthermore, in endogenous H723R-PDS-expressing human nasal epithelial cells, PC2-1 significantly increased the surface expression of pendrin. PC2-1 exhibited high membrane permeability in vitro and high micromolar concentrations in the cochlear perilymph in vivo. In addition, neither inhibition of Kv11.1 activity in the human ether-a-go-go-related gene assay nor cell toxicity in the cell proliferation assay was observed at a high PC2-1 concentration (30 μM). These preclinical data support the hypothesis of the druggability of mutant pendrin using the novel corrector molecule PC2-1. In conclusion, PC2-1 may be a new therapeutic molecule for ameliorating hearing loss and treating vestibular disorders in patients with Pendred syndrome or DFNB4.",2023-09-09
37651197,Targeting TREM1 augments antitumor T cell immunity by inhibiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells and restraining anti-PD-1 resistance.,"The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 1 (TREM1) plays a critical role in development of chronic inflammatory disorders and the inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with most solid tumors. We examined whether loss of TREM1 signaling can abrogate the immunosuppressive TME and enhance cancer immunity. To investigate the therapeutic potential of TREM1 in cancer, we used mice deficient in Trem1 and developed a novel small molecule TREM1 inhibitor, VJDT. We demonstrated that genetic or pharmacological TREM1 silencing significantly delayed tumor growth in murine melanoma (B16F10) and fibrosarcoma (MCA205) models. Single-cell RNA-Seq combined with functional assays during TREM1 deficiency revealed decreased immunosuppressive capacity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accompanied by expansion in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and increased PD-1 expression. Furthermore, TREM1 inhibition enhanced the antitumorigenic effect of anti-PD-1 treatment, in part, by limiting MDSC frequency and abrogating T cell exhaustion. In patient-derived melanoma xenograft tumors, treatment with VJDT downregulated key oncogenic signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Our work highlights the role of TREM1 in cancer progression, both intrinsically expressed in cancer cells and extrinsically in the TME. Thus, targeting TREM1 to modify an immunosuppressive TME and improve efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy represents what we believe to be a promising therapeutic approach to cancer.",2023-11-01

37641936,Avenanthramide-C Shows Potential to Alleviate Gingival Inflammation and Alveolar Bone Loss in Experimental Periodontitis.,"Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to the gradual destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth including gums, periodontal ligaments, alveolar bone, and root cementum. Recently, interests in alleviating symptoms of periodontitis (PD) using natural compounds is increasing. Avenanthramide-C (Avn-C) is a polyphenol found only in oats. It is known to exhibit various biological properties. To date, the effect of Avn-C on PD pathogenesis has not been confirmed. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the protective effects of Avn-C on periodontal inflammation and subsequent alveolar bone erosion <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Upregulated expression of catabolic factors, such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), MMP3, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and COX2 induced by lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), was dramatically decreased by Avn-C treatment in human gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament cells. Moreover, alveolar bone erosion in the ligature-induced PD mouse model was ameliorated by intra-gingival injection of Avn-C. Molecular mechanism studies revealed that the inhibitory effects of Avn-C on the upregulation of catabolic factors were mediated via ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and NF-κB pathway that was activated by IL-1β or p38 MAPK and JNK signaling that was activated by TNF-α, respectively. Based on this study, we recommend that Avn-C may be a new natural compound that can be applied to PD treatment.",2023-08-29
37632447,Development of a Selective Peptide κ-Opioid Receptor Antagonist by Late-Stage Functionalization with Cysteine Staples.,"The κ-opioid receptor (KOR) is an attractive target for the development of novel drugs. KOR agonists are potentially safer pain medications, whereas KOR antagonists are promising drug candidates for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Hitherto, the vast majority of selective drug leads that have been developed for KOR are small molecules. In this study, novel peptide probes were designed by using an endogenous dynorphin A<sub>1-13</sub> sequence as a template for peptide stapling via late-stage cysteine functionalization. Leveraging this strategy, we developed a stable and potent KOR antagonist, CSD-CH<sub>2(1,8)</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub>, with approximately 1000-fold improved selectivity for KOR over μ- and δ-opioid receptors. Its potent competitive KOR antagonism was verified in KOR-expressing cells, peripheral dorsal root ganglion neurons, and using the tail-flick and rotarod tests in mice. This work highlights the value of cysteine stapling to develop selective peptide probes to modulate central KOR function, as innovative peptide drug candidates for the treatment of KOR-related illnesses.",2023-08-26

37608843,OCE-205 in rats and non-human primates: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis.,"Treatment for complications associated with the hemodynamic consequences of decompensated cirrhosis remains suboptimal. Terlipressin, the latest pharmacological management of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI), targets the vasopressin system but has serious side effects. OCE-205 is a novel peptide designed to target the vasopressin receptor system as a mixed V1a agonist/antagonist, resulting in effective partial agonism without V2 agonism. We examined the <i>in vivo</i> pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of OCE-205 in healthy rats and cynomolgus monkeys. OCE-205 was administered by IV or SC bolus injection; arginine vasopressin (AVP) or terlipressin were comparators. After IV OCE-205 administration in rats, mean plasma concentration decreased in a mostly linear manner to 2 mg/mL after 120 min, and for SC administration, slowly decreased to ∼50 ng/mL after 300 min. Compared with pre-test values, arterial blood pressure values significantly increased after all OCE-205 doses tested. For monkeys, the concentration after IV OCE-205 administration was mostly linear to 5 ng/mL after 180 min, and for SC administration, ∼3 ng/mL after 480 min. Subcutaneous OCE-205 administration increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) versus baseline, with ΔMAP in OCE-205-treated animals marked and long-lasting while terlipressin induced an increase from baseline in MAP, with negligible ΔMAP, on average, by 150 min after administration in all groups. AVP, but not OCE-205, significantly increased blood lactate concentrations. OCE-205 was well tolerated in adult male rats and cynomolgus monkeys following single-dose bolus administration. The preclinical results of OCE-205, with its demonstrated V1a selective partial agonist activity and potentially tolerable safety profile, suggest its potential utility for treatment of the cardiovascular complications of cirrhosis.",2023-08-09
37603424,Development of Novel Peptide-Modified Silver Nanoparticle-Based Rapid Biosensors for Detecting Aminoglycoside Antibiotics.,"The detection and monitoring of aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGAs) have become of utmost importance due to their widespread use in human and animal therapy, as well as the associated risks of exposure, toxicity, and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we successfully synthesized casein hydrolysate peptides-functionalized silver nanoparticles (CHPs@AgNPs) and employed them as a novel colorimetric analytical platform to demonstrate remarkable specificity and sensitivity toward AGAs. The colorimetric and spectral response of the CHPs@AgNPs was observed at 405 and 520 nm, showing a linear correlation with the concentration of streptomycin, a representative AGA. The color changes from yellow to orange provided a visual indication of the analyte concentration, enabling quantitative determination for real-world samples. The AgNP assay exhibited excellent sensitivity with dynamic ranges of approximately 200-650 and 100-700 nM for streptomycin-spiked tap water and dairy whey with limits of detection found to be ∼98 and 56 nM, respectively. The mechanism behind the selective aggregation of CHPs@AgNPs in the presence of AGAs involves the amine groups of the target analytes acting as molecular bridges for electrostatic coupling with hydroxyl or carboxyl functionalities of adjacent NPs, driving the formation of stable NP aggregates. The developed assay offers several advantages, making it suitable for various practical applications. It is characterized by its simplicity, rapidity, specificity, sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness. These unique features make the method a promising tool for monitoring water quality, ensuring food safety, and dealing with emergent issues of antibiotic resistance.",2023-08-21
37601059,Alleviation of hippocampal necroptosis and neuroinflammation by NecroX-7 treatment after acute seizures.,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common neurological disorders, but still one-third of patients cannot be properly treated by current medication. Thus, we investigated the therapeutic effects of a novel small molecule, NecroX-7, in TLE using both a low [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-induced epileptiform activity model and a mouse model of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). NecroX-7 post-treatment enhanced the viability of primary hippocampal neurons exposed to low [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> compared to controls in an MTT assay. Application of NecroX-7 after pilocarpine-induced SE also reduced the number of degenerating neurons labelled with Fluoro-Jade B. Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry showed that NecroX-7 post-treatment significantly alleviated ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) intensity and immunoreactive area, while the attenuation of reactive astrocytosis by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining was observed in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, NecroX-7-mediated morphologic changes of astrocytes were seen in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of TLE. Finally, western blot analysis demonstrated that NecroX-7 post-treatment after acute seizures could decrease the expression of mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL) and phosphorylated MLKL (p-MLKL), markers for necroptosis. Taken all together, NecroX-7 has potential as a novel medication for TLE with its neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-necroptotic effects.",2023-08-02

Persistent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including neuroinflammation, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, lupus nephritis and severe asthma. Here we describe the preclinical profile of JT002, a novel small molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. JT002 potently reduced NLRP3-dependent proinflammatory cytokine production across a number of cellular assays and prevented pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death triggered by active caspase-1. JT002 demonstrated in vivo target engagement at therapeutically relevant concentrations when orally dosed in mice and prevented body weight loss and improved inflammatory and fibrotic endpoints in a model of Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS). In two distinct models of neutrophilic airway inflammation, JT002 treatment significantly reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and airway neutrophilia. These results provide a rationale for the therapeutic targeting of the NLRP3 inflammasome in severe asthma and point to the use of JT002 in a variety of inflammatory disorders.",2023-08-19
37591119,The novel small molecule TPN10518 alleviates EAE pathogenesis by inhibiting AP1 to depress Th1/Th17 cell differentiation.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases of central nervous system (CNS) demyelination. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most classic animal model for simulating the onset of clinical symptoms in MS. Previous research has reported the anti-inflammatory effects of artemisinin on autoimmune diseases. In our study, we identified a novel small molecule, TPN10518, an artemisinin derivative, which plays a protective role on the EAE model. We found that TPN10518 reduced CNS inflammatory cell infiltration and alleviated clinical symptoms of EAE. In addition, TPN10518 downregulated the production of Th1 and Th17 cells in vivo and in vitro, and decrease the levels of related chemokines. RNA-seq assay combined with the experimental results demonstrated that TPN10518 lowered the mRNA and protein levels of the AP1 subunits c-Fos and c-Jun in EAE mice. It was further confirmed that TPN10518 was dependent on AP1 to inhibit the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells. The results suggest that TPN10518 reduces the production of Th1 and Th17 cells through inhibition of AP1 to alleviate the severity of EAE disease. It is expected to be a potential drug for the treatment of MS.",2023-08-15
37589886,Therapeutic Effect of HDAC5 Binding and Cell Penetrating Peptide for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an incurable disease that negatively influences the quality of life of patients. Current and emerging therapies target proinflammatory cytokines and/or receptors to downregulate proinflammatory responses, but insufficient remission requires other therapeutic agents. Herein, we report that the synthetic anti-inflammatory peptide 15 (SAP15) is capable of cell penetration and anti-inflammatory activity in human macrophages.",2023-08-17
37588207,"A novel FGFR1 inhibitor CYY292 suppresses tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis of glioblastoma by inhibiting the Akt/GSK3β/snail signaling axis.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor that grows quickly, spreads widely, and is resistant to treatment. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation. FGFR1 was predominantly expressed in GBM tissues, and FGFR1 expression was negatively correlated with overall survival. We rationally designed a novel small molecule CYY292, which exhibited a strong affinity for the FGFR1 protein in GBM cell lines <i>in vitro</i>. CYY292 also exerted an effect on the conserved Ser777 residue of <i>FGFR1</i>. CYY292 dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stemness, invasion, and migration <i>in vitro</i> by specifically targeting the FGFR1/AKT/Snail pathways in GBM cells, and this effect was prevented by pharmacological inhibitors and critical gene knockdown. <i>In vivo</i> experiments revealed that CYY292 inhibited U87MG tumor growth more effectively than AZD4547. CYY292 also efficiently reduced GBM cell proliferation and increased survival in orthotopic GBM models. This study further elucidates the function of FGFR1 in the GBM and reveals the effect of CYY292, which targets FGFR1, on downstream signaling pathways directly reducing GBM cell growth, invasion, and metastasis and thus impairing the recruitment, activation, and function of immune cells.",2023-04-03
37578890,Restoring connexin-36 function in diabetogenic environments precludes mouse and human islet dysfunction.,"The secretion of insulin from β-cells in the islet of Langerhans is governed by a series of metabolic and electrical events, which can fail during the progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D). β-cells are electrically coupled via connexin-36 (Cx36) gap junction channels, which coordinates the pulsatile dynamics of [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] and insulin release across the islet. Factors such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids disrupt gap junction coupling under in vitro conditions. Here we test whether gap junction coupling and coordinated [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] dynamics are disrupted in T2D, and whether recovery of gap junction coupling can recover islet function. We examine islets from donors with T2D, from db/db mice, and islets treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-ɣ) or free fatty acids (palmitate). We modulate gap junction coupling using Cx36 over-expression or pharmacological activation via modafinil. We also develop a peptide mimetic (S293) of the c-terminal regulatory site of Cx36 designed to compete against its phosphorylation. Cx36 gap junction permeability and [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] dynamics were disrupted in islets from both human donors with T2D and db/db mice, and in islets treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines or palmitate. Cx36 over-expression, modafinil treatment and S293 peptide all enhanced Cx36 gap junction coupling and protected against declines in coordinated [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] dynamics. Cx36 over-expression and S293 peptide also reduced apoptosis induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Critically, S293 peptide rescued gap junction coupling and [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] dynamics in islets from both db/db mice and a sub-set of T2D donors. Thus, recovering or enhancing Cx36 gap junction coupling can improve islet function in diabetes. KEY POINTS: Connexin-36 (Cx36) gap junction permeability and associated coordination of [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] dynamics is diminished in human type 2 diabetes (T2D) and mouse models of T2D. Enhancing Cx36 gap junction permeability protects against disruptions to the coordination of [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] dynamics. A novel peptide mimetic of the Cx36 c-terminal regulatory region protects against declines in Cx36 gap junction permeability. Pharmacological elevation in Cx36 or Cx36 peptide mimetic recovers [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] dynamics and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human T2D and mouse models of T2D.",2023-08-14
37577264,Reduction of <i>Chlamydia pecorum</i> and Koala Retrovirus subtype B expression in wild koalas vaccinated with novel peptide and peptide/recombinant protein formulations.,"Koalas are an endangered species under threat of extinction from several factors, including infections agents. <i>Chlamydia pecorum</i> infection results in morbidity and mortality from ocular and urogenital diseases while Koala Retrovirus (KoRV) infection has been linked to increased rates of cancer and chlamydiosis. Both <i>C. pecorum</i> and KoRV are endemic in many wild Australian koala populations, with limited treatment options available. Fortunately, vaccines for these pathogens are under development and have generated effective immune responses in multiple trials. The current study aimed to improve vaccine formulations by testing a novel peptide version of the <i>Chlamydia</i> vaccine and a combination <i>Chlamydia</i> - KoRV vaccine. Utilising a monitored wild population in Southeast Queensland, this trial followed koalas given either a 'Chlamydia only' vaccine (utilising four peptides from the chlamydial Major Outer Membrane Protein, MOMP), a combination 'Chlamydia and KoRV' vaccine (comprised of the chlamydial peptides plus a KoRV recombinant envelope protein (rEnv)) or no treatment. Clinical observations, <i>C. pecorum</i> and KoRV gene expression, serum IgG, and mucosal immune gene expression were assessed over a 17-month period. Overall, both vaccine formulations resulted in a decrease in chlamydiosis mortality, with decreases in <i>C. pecorum</i>, CD4, CD8β and IL-17A gene expression observed. In addition, the combination vaccine group also showed an increase in anti-KoRV IgG production that corresponded to a decrease in detected KoRV-B expression. While these results are favourable, the chlamydial peptide vaccine did not appear to outperform the established recombinant chlamydial vaccine and suggests that a combination vaccine formulated with recombinant MOMP plus KoRV rEnv could capitalize on the demonstrated benefits of both for the betterment of koalas into the future.",2023-06-08
37567457,The novel peptide athycaltide-1 attenuates Ang II-induced pathological myocardial hypertrophy by reducing ROS and inhibiting the activation of CaMKII and ERK1/2.,"Pathological myocardial hypertrophy initially develops as an adaptive response to cardiac stress, which can be induced by many diseases. It is accompanied by adverse cardiovascular events, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and death. The purpose of this research was to explore the molecular mechanism of a novel peptide Athycaltide-1 (ATH-1) in the treatment of Ang II-induced pathological myocardial hypertrophy. In this study, the mRNA of Control group, Ang II group, ATH-1 group and Losartan group mice were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in cell response to oxidative stress, regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolism and calmodulin binding. Then, the oxidation level of mouse hearts and H9c2 cardiomyocytes in each group and the expression of key proteins of CaMKII/HDAC/MEF2C and ERK1/2 signaling pathways were detected to preliminarily verify the positive effect of ATH-1. At the same time, the effect of ATH-1 was further determined by adding reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and CaMKII inhibitor AIP in vitro. The results showed that ATH-1 could significantly reduce the level of oxidative stress in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and inhibiting the activation of CaMKII and ERK1/2.",2023-08-09

37542030,Histone acetylation by HBO1 (KAT7) activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote leukemogenesis in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is an aggressive hematological disorder with a dismal prognosis. The dysregulation of histone acetylation is of great significance in the pathogenesis and progression of B-ALL. Regarded as a fundamental acetyltransferase gene, the role of HBO1 (lysine acetyltransferase 7/KAT7) in B-ALL has not been investigated. Herein, we found that HBO1 expression was elevated in human B-ALL cells and associated with poor disease-free survival. Strikingly, HBO1 knockdown inhibited viability, proliferation, and G1-S cycle progression in B-ALL cells, while provoking apoptosis. In contrast, ectopic overexpression of HBO1 enhanced cell viability and proliferation but inhibited apoptotic activation. The results of in vivo experiments also certificated the inhibitory effect of HBO1 knockdown on tumor growth. Mechanistically, HBO1 acetylated histone H3K14, H4K8, and H4K12, followed by upregulating CTNNB1 expression, resulting in activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, a novel small molecule inhibitor of HBO1, WM-3835, potently inhibited the progression of B-ALL. Our data identified HBO1 as an efficacious regulator of CTNNB1 with therapeutic potential in B-ALL.",2023-08-04
37536035,Discovery of a novel small molecule with efficacy in protecting against inflammation in vitro and in vivo by enhancing macrophages activation.,"Immune response and inflammation highly contribute to many metabolic syndromes such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ageing and cancer with disruption of host metabolic homeostasis and the gut microbiome. Icariin-1 (GH01), a small-molecule flavonoid derived from Epimedium, has been shown to protect against systemic inflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GH01 ameliorates ulcerative colitis via regulation of microbiota-mediated macrophages polarization remain elusive. In this study, we found that GH01 effectively ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis symptoms in mice. Disruption of intestinal barrier function, commensal microbiota and its metabolites were also significantly restored by GH01 in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, we also found that GH01 enhanced phagocytic ability of macrophages and switched macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2 both in vitro and in vivo. Such macrophage polarization was highly associated with intestinal barrier integrity and the gut microbial community. Consequently, GH01 exhibited strong anti-inflammatory capacity by inhibiting TLR4 and NF-κB pathways and proinflammatory factors (IL-6). These findings suggested that GH01 might be a potential nutritional intervention strategy for IBD treatment with the gut microbial community-meditated macrophage as the therapeutic targets.",2023-08-01
37528888,"TAK-242, a toll-like receptor 4 antagonist, against brain injury by alleviates autophagy and inflammation in rats.","Inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammatory pathways exerts a critical effect on neuronal death; therefore, it is a possible new therapeutic approach for traumatic brain injury (TBI). Resatorvid (TAK-242) is a novel small-molecule compound widely used to inhibit TLR4-mediated pathways, but the protective mechanism of TAK-242 in TBI remains unclear. Herein, we analyzed the neuroprotective effects of TAK-242 in rats after TBI. The rat model of brain injury was established using a modified Free-fall device, and the rats were injected with TAK-242 (0.5 mg/kg) through the caudal vein before TBI. The rats were allocated into four groups: a sham group, a TBI group, a TBI + vehicle group, and a TBI + TAK-242 group. The brain tissue was extracted for histology and determination of the expression of autophagy-related proteins and inflammatory mediators. TAK-242 pretreatment significantly reduced the damage to hippocampal neurons. Neuronal autophagy increased after brain injury, whereas TAK-242 significantly reduced autophagy marker protein LC3-II in the hippocampus. In addition, TAK-242 pretreatment significantly downregulated NF-κB p65, TNF-α, and IL-1β in the hippocampus. In conclusion, TAK-242 significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal damage by inhibiting autophagy and neuroinflammatory activity, possibly via the NF-κB signaling pathway.",2023-07-29
37506701,CLK2 and CLK4 are regulators of DNA damage-induced NF-κB targeted by novel small molecule inhibitors.,"Transcription factor NF-κB potently activates anti-apoptotic genes, and its inactivation significantly reduces tumor cell survival following genotoxic stresses. We identified two structurally distinct lead compounds that selectively inhibit NF-κB activation by DNA double-strand breaks, but not by other stimuli, such as TNFα. Our compounds do not directly inhibit previously identified regulators of this pathway, most critically including IκB kinase (IKK), but inhibit signal transmission in-between ATM, PARP1, and IKKγ. Deconvolution strategies, including derivatization and in vitro testing in multi-kinase panels, yielded shared targets, cdc-like kinase (CLK) 2 and 4, as essential regulators of DNA damage-induced IKK and NF-κB activity. Both leads sensitize to DNA damaging agents by increasing p53-induced apoptosis, thereby reducing cancer cell viability. We propose that our lead compounds and derivatives can be used in context of genotoxic therapy-induced or ongoing DNA damage to increase tumor cell apoptosis, which may be beneficial in cancer treatment.",2023-07-27
37504963,"Machine learning and biological evaluation-based identification of a potential MMP-9 inhibitor, effective against ovarian cancer cells SKOV3.","MMP-9, also known as gelatinase B, is a zinc-metalloproteinase family protein that plays a key role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The normal function of MMP-9 includes the breakdown of ECM, a process that aids in normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, etc. Interruptions in these processes due to the over-expression or downregulation of MMP-9 are reported to cause some pathological conditions like neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In the present study, an integrated approach for ML-based virtual screening of the Maybridge library was carried out and their biological activity was tested in an attempt to identify novel small molecule scaffolds that can inhibit the activity of MMP-9. The top hits were identified and selected for target-based activity against MMP-9 protein using the kit (Biovision K844). Further, MTT assay was performed in various cancer cell lines such as breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), colorectal (HCT119, DL-D-1), cervical (HeLa), lung (A549) and ovarian cancer (SKOV3). Interestingly, one compound viz., RJF02215 exhibited anti-cancer activity selectively in SKOV3. Wound healing assay and colony formation assay performed on SKOV3 cell line in the presence of RJF02215 confirmed that the compound had a significant inhibitory effect on this cell line. Thus, we have identified a novel molecule that can inhibit MMP-9 activity <i>in vitro</i> and inhibits the proliferation of SKOV3 cells. Novel molecules based on the structure of RJF02215 may become a good value addition for the treatment of ovarian cancer by exhibiting selective MMP-9 activity.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

37495988,Characterization of a novel peptide mined from the Red Sea brine pools and modified to enhance its anticancer activity.,"Drug resistance is a major cause of the inefficacy of conventional cancer therapies, and often accompanied by severe side effects. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs with low cytotoxicity, high selectivity and minimal acquired chemical resistance. Peptide-based drugs (less than 0.5 kDa) have emerged as a potential approach to address these issues due to their high specificity and potent anticancer activity. In this study, we developed a support vector machine model (SVM) to detect the potential anticancer properties of novel peptides by scanning the American University in Cairo (AUC) Red Sea metagenomics library. We identified a novel 37-mer antimicrobial peptide through SVM pipeline analysis and characterized its anticancer potential through in silico cross-examination. The peptide sequence was further modified to enhance its anticancer activity, analyzed for gene ontology, and subsequently synthesized. To evaluate the anticancer properties of the modified 37-mer peptide, we assessed its effect on the viability and morphology of SNU449, HepG2, SKOV3, and HeLa cells, using an MTT assay. Additionally, we evaluated the migration capabilities of SNU449 and SKOV3 cells using a scratch-wound healing assay. The targeted selectivity of the modified peptide was examined by evaluating its hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes. Treatment with the peptide significantly reduced cell viability and had a critical impact on the morphology of hepatocellular carcinoma (SNU449 and HepG2), and ovarian cancer (SKOV3) cells, with a marginal effect on cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa). The viability of a human fibroblast cell line (1Br-hTERT) was also significantly reduced by peptide treatment, as were the proliferation and migration abilities of SNU449 and SKOV3 cells. The annexin V assay revealed programmed cell death (apoptosis) as one of the potential cellular death pathways in SNU449 cells upon peptide treatment. Finally, the peptide exhibited antimicrobial effects on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The findings presented here suggest the potential of our novel peptide as a potent anticancer and antimicrobial agent.",2023-07-26
37467878,Immunogenicity risk assessment of synthetic peptide drugs and their impurities.,"Peptide drugs play an important part in medicine owing to their many therapeutic applications. Of the 80 peptide drugs approved for use in humans, at least five are now off-patent and are consequently being developed as generic alternatives to the originator products. To accelerate access to generic products, the FDA has proposed new regulatory pathways that do not require direct comparisons of generics to originators in clinical trials. The 'Abbreviated New Drug Application' (ANDA) pathway recommends that sponsors provide information on any new impurities in the generic drug, compared with the originator product, because the impurities can have potential to elicit unwanted immune responses owing to the introduction of T-cell epitopes. This review describes how peptide drug impurities can elicit unexpected immunogenicity and describes a framework for performing immunogenicity risk assessment of all types of bioactive peptide products. Although this report primarily focuses on generic peptides and their impurities, the approach might also be of interest for developers of novel peptide drugs who are preparing their products for an initial regulatory review.",2023-07-17
37465877,Novel GRPR-Targeting Peptide for Pancreatic Cancer Molecular Imaging in Orthotopic and Liver Metastasis Mouse Models.,"Despite advancements in pancreatic cancer treatment, it remains one of the most lethal malignancies with extremely poor diagnosis and prognosis. Herein, we demonstrated the efficiency of a novel peptide GB-6 labeled with a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye 3H-indolium, 2-[2-[2-[(2-carboxyethyl)thio]-3-[2-[1,3-dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-5-sulfo-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-2H-indol-2-ylidene]ethylidene]-1-cyclohexen-1-yl]ethenyl]-3,3-dimethyl-5-sulfo-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-, inner salt (MPA) and radionuclide technetium-99m (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) as targeting probes using the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) that is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer as the target. A short linear peptide with excellent in vivo stability was identified, and its radiotracer [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-HYNIC-PEG<sub>4</sub>-GB-6 and the NIR probe MPA-PEG<sub>4</sub>-GB-6 exhibited selective and specific uptake by tumors in an SW1990 pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse model. The favorable biodistribution of the tracer [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-HYNIC-PEG<sub>4</sub>-GB-6 in vivo afforded tumor-specific accumulation with high tumor-to-muscle and -bone contrasts and renal body clearance at 1 h after injection. The biodistribution analysis revealed that the tumor-to-pancreas and -intestine fluorescence signal ratios were 5.2 ± 0.3 and 6.3 ± 1.5, respectively, in the SW1990 subcutaneous xenograft model. Furthermore, the high signal accumulation in the orthotopic pancreatic and liver metastasis tumor models with tumor-to-pancreas and -liver fluorescence signal ratios of 7.66 ± 0.48 and 3.94 ± 0.47, respectively, enabled clear tumor visualization for intraoperative navigation. The rapid tumor targeting, precise tumor boundary delineation, chemical versatility, and high potency of the novel GB-6 peptide established it as a high-contrast imaging probe for the clinical detection of GRPR, with compelling additional potential in molecular-targeted therapy.",2023-07-19

37459824,Synthesis of and anti-fibrotic effect of pyrazole derivative J-1048: Inhibition of ALK5 as a novel approach to liver fibrosis targeting inflammation.,"Liver fibrosis is a worldwide challenge of health issue. Developing effective new drugs for treating liver fibrosis is of great importance. In recent years, chemically synthesized drugs have significant advantages in treating liver fibrosis. Small molecule pyrazole derivatives as activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) inhibitors have also shown anti-fibrotic and tumor growth inhibitory effects. To develop the candidate with anti-fibrotic effect, we synthesized a novel pyrazole derivative, J-1048. The inhibitory effect of J-1048 on ALK5 and p38α mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity was assessed by enzymatic assays. We established an in vivo liver fibrosis model by injecting thioacetamide (TAA) into mice and in vitro model of TGF-β stimulated hepatic stellated cells to explore the inhibition mechanisms and therapeutic potential of J-1048 as an ALK5 inhibitor in liver fibrosis. Our data showed that J-1048 inhibited TAA-induced liver fibrosis in mice by explicitly blocking the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Additionally, J-1048 inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by inhibiting the purinergic ligand-gated ion channel 7 receptor (P2X7r) -Nucleotide-binding domain-(NOD-)like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) axis, thereby alleviating liver fibrosis. Our findings demonstrated that a novel small molecule ALK5 inhibitor, J-1048, exhibited strong potential as a clinical therapeutic candidate for liver fibrosis.",2023-07-12
37440912,Effects and translatomics characteristics of a small-molecule inhibitor of METTL3 against non-small cell lung cancer.,"In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the heterogeneity promotes drug resistance, and the restricted expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) limits the immunotherapy benefits. Based on the mechanisms related to translation regulation and the association with PD-L1 of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), the novel small-molecule inhibitor STM2457 is assumed to be useful for the treatment of NSCLC. We evaluated the efficacy of STM2457 in vivo and in vitro and confirmed the effects of its inhibition on disease progression. Next, we explored the effect of STM2457 on METTL3 and revealed its effects on the inhibition of catalytic activity and upregulation of METTL3 protein expression. Importantly, we described the genome-wide characteristics of multiple omics data acquired from RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing data under STM2457 treatment or METTL3 knockout. We also constructed a model for the regulation of the translation of METTL3 and PD-L1. Finally, we found PD-L1 upregulation by STM2457 in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, STM2457 is a potential novel suppressor based on its inhibitory effect on tumor progression and may be able to overcome the heterogeneity based on its impact on the translatome. Furthermore, it can improve the immunotherapy outcomes based on PD-L1 upregulation in NSCLC.",2023-04-19
37429363,A Novel Peptide Prevents Enterotoxin- and Inflammation-Induced Intestinal Fluid Secretion by Stimulating Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 3 Activity.,"Acute diarrheal diseases are the second most common cause of infant mortality in developing countries. This is contributed to by lack of effective drug therapy that shortens the duration or lessens the volume of diarrhea. The epithelial brush border sodium (Na+)/hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) exchanger 3 (NHE3) accounts for a major component of intestinal Na<sup>+</sup> absorption and is inhibited in most diarrheas. Because increased intestinal Na<sup>+</sup> absorption can rehydrate patients with diarrhea, NHE3 has been suggested as a potential druggable target for drug therapy for diarrhea.",2023-07-08

37415305,A novel peptide derived from vascular endothelial growth factor prevents amyloid beta aggregation and toxicity.,"Amyloid-β oligomers (Aβo) are the most pathologically relevant Aβ species in Alzheimer's disease (AD), because they induce early synaptic dysfunction that leads to learning and memory impairments. In contrast, increasing VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) brain levels have been shown to improve learning and memory processes, and to alleviate Aβ-mediated synapse dysfunction. Here, we designed a new peptide, the blocking peptide (BP), which is derived from an Aβo-targeted domain of the VEGF protein, and investigated its effect on Aβ-associated toxicity. Using a combination of biochemical, 3D and ultrastructural imaging, and electrophysiological approaches, we demonstrated that BP strongly interacts with Aβo and blocks Aβ fibrillar aggregation process, leading to the formation of Aβ amorphous aggregates. BP further impedes the formation of structured Aβo and prevents their pathogenic binding to synapses. Importantly, acute BP treatment successfully rescues long-term potentiation (LTP) in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, at an age when LTP is highly impaired in hippocampal slices. Moreover, BP is also able to block the interaction between Aβo and VEGF, which suggests a dual mechanism aimed at both trapping Aβo and releasing VEGF to alleviate Aβo-induced synaptic damage. Our findings provide evidence for a neutralizing effect of the BP on Aβ aggregation process and pathogenic action, highlighting a potential new therapeutic strategy.",2023-07-06
37406957,A novel peptide P1-121aa encoded by STK24P1 regulates vasculogenic mimicry via ELF2 phosphorylation in glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a hematological system composed of tumor cells that exert blood perfusion without relying on vascular endothelial cells. The current poor results of anti-vascular therapy for clinical GBM are associated with the presence of VM; therefore, it is important to investigate VM formation in GBM. Our results demonstrate that STK24P1 encodes P1-121aa with a kinase structural domain, and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that P1-121aa mediates modification of ELF2 phosphorylation. ChIP and dual luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that the transcription factor ELF2 binds to VE-cadherin and the VEGFR2 promoter region, thereby promoting VM formation in glioma cells. P1-121aa, encoded by the pseudogene STK24P1, phosphorylates ELF2 at S107, increasing the stability of the ELF2 protein. ELF2 promotes VEGFR2 and VE-cadherin expression at the transcriptional level, which in turn promotes VM in GBM. This study demonstrates the important roles of STK24P1, P1-121aa, and ELF2 in regulating VM in GBM, which could provide potential targets for GBM treatment.",2023-07-03
37406849,CT2-3 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes through regulating PI3K/AKT pathway.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of chronic autoimmune disease. The existing therapies encountered several challenges. Therefore, continued novel anti-RA drug discovery remains necessary for RA therapy. Recently, our group reported a novel compound named CT2-3, which could be realized as a hybrid of the natural product magnolol and phthalimide and exhibited anti-lung cancer activity. However, the effect of CT2-3 on RA is unclear. Here, we aim to explore the effect and potential mechanism of CT2-3 on the abnormal functions of RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs). In this study, we identified the important role of the dysregulated cell cycle and apoptosis of RA-FLSs in RA progression. Interestingly, we found that CT2-3 inhibited the proliferation and DNA replication of primary RA-FLSs and immortalized RA-FLSs namely MH7A. In addition, CT2-3 downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin A2, and cyclin B1, resulting in cell cycle arrest of primary RA-FLSs and MH7A cells. Also, CT2-3 downregulated the level of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and increased the level of Bcl-2 associated X (Bax), contributing to apoptosis of primary RA-FLSs and MH7A cells. Furthermore, differential analyses of RNA-sequencing, Western blot, and network pharmacological analysis confirmed that CT2-3 inhibited phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway of primary RA-FLSs and MH7A cells. In conclusion, CT2-3 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in RA-FLSs through modulating PI3K/AKT pathway, which may serve as a potential lead compound for further novel small molecule anti-RA drug development.",2023-07-03
37396624,Dual-targeting inhibition of TNFR1 for alleviating rheumatoid arthritis by a novel composite nucleic acid nanodrug.,"Selective suppression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling is a potent solution for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Herein, novel composite nucleic acid nanodrugs that simultaneously restrain TNF α binding and TNFR1 multimerization were designed to reinforce inhibition of TNF α-TNFR1 signaling for RA therapy. Towards this end, a novel peptide Pep4-19 that suppresses TNFR1 clustering was extracted from TNFR1. The resulting peptide and a DNA aptamer Apt2-55, which inhibits TNF α binding, were integrally or separately anchored on DNA tetrahedron (TD) to obtain nanodrugs with different spatial distribution of Apt2-55 and Pep4-19 (TD-3A-3P and TD-3(A-P)). Our results showed that Pep4-19 enhanced the viability of inflammatory L929 cells. Both TD-3A-3P and TD-3(A-P) suppressed caspase 3, reduced cell apoptosis, and inhibited FLS-RA migration. Compared to TD-3(A-P), TD-3A-3P supplied sufficient flexibility for Apt2-55 and Pep4-19, and showed better anti-inflammation properties. Furthermore, TD-3A-3P significantly relieved symptoms in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, and the anti-RA efficacy through intravenous injection was comparable to transdermal administration <i>via</i> microneedles. Overall, the work provides an effective strategy for RA treatment by dual-targeting TNFR1, and demonstrates that microneedles are promising approach to drug administration in the treatment of RA.",2023-01-10
37389813,Discovery of Acyl-Indole Derivatives as Pan-Serotype Dengue Virus NS4B Inhibitors.,"In the absence of any approved dengue-specific treatment, the discovery and development of a novel small-molecule antiviral for the prevention or treatment of dengue are critical. We previously reported the identification of a novel series of 3-acyl-indole derivatives as potent and pan-serotype dengue virus inhibitors. We herein describe our optimization efforts toward preclinical candidates <b>24a</b> and <b>28a</b> with improved pan-serotype coverage (EC<sub>50</sub>'s against the four DENV serotypes ranging from 0.0011 to 0.24 μM for <b>24a</b> and from 0.00060 to 0.084 μM for <b>28a</b>), chiral stability, and oral bioavailability in preclinical species, as well as showing a dose-proportional increase in efficacy against DENV-2 infection in vivo in mice.",2023-06-30

However, the current drug that is capable of inhibition pyroptosis has not been translated successfully in the clinic, suggesting a requirement for drug screening in depth.",2023-06-28
37373393,Multi-Omics Identification of Genetic Alterations in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Therapeutic Efficacy of HNC018 as a Novel Multi-Target Agent for c-MET/STAT3/AKT Signaling Axis.,"Amongst the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. The failure of standard treatment modalities, such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, demands the need for in-depth understanding of the complex signaling networks involved in the development of treatment resistance. A tumor's invasive growth and high levels of intrinsic or acquired treatment resistance are the primary causes of treatment failure. This may be a result of the presence of HNSCC's cancer stem cells, which are known to have self-renewing capabilities that result in therapeutic resistance. Using bioinformatics methods, we discovered that elevated expressions of MET, STAT3, and AKT were associated with poor overall survival in HNSCC patients. We then evaluated the therapeutic potential of our newly synthesized small molecule HNC018 towards its potential as a novel anticancer drug. Our computer-aided structure characterization and target identification study predicted that HNC018 could target these oncogenic markers implicated in HNSCC. Subsequently, the HNC018 has demonstrated its anti-proliferative and anticancer activities towards the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, along with displaying the stronger binding affinities towards the MET, STAT3, and AKT than the standard drug cisplatin. Reduction in the clonogenic and tumor-sphere-forming ability displays HNC018's role in decreasing the tumorigenicity. Importantly, an vivo study has shown a significant delay in tumor growth in HNC018 alone or in combination with cisplatin-treated xenograft mice model. Collectively with our findings, HNC018 highlights the desirable properties of a drug-like candidate and could be considered as a novel small molecule for treating head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",2023-06-16
37369296,A novel small molecule effectively ameliorates estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis by targeting the gut-bone signaling axis.,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis stems mainly from estrogen deficiency leading to a gut microbiome-dependent disruption of host systemic immunity. However, the underlying mechanisms of estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss remain elusive and novel pharmaceutical intervention strategies for osteoporosis are needed. Here we reveal that ovariectomy (ovx)-induced estrogen deficiency in C57BL/6 mice causes significant disruption of gut microbiota composition, consequently leading to marked destruction of intestinal barrier function and gut leakage. As a result, signals transportation between intestinal microbiota and T cells from the gut to bone marrow is identified to contribute to osteoclastogenesis in ovx mice. Notably, we show that icariside I (GH01), a novel small molecule naturally occurring in Herbal Epimedium, has potential to alleviate or prevent ovx-induced bone loss in mice through regulation of gut-bone signaling axis. We find that GH01 treatment can effectively restore the gut microbiota composition, intestinal barrier function and host immune status markedly altered in ovx mice, thus significantly ameliorating bone loss and osteoporosis. These findings not only provide systematic understanding of the gut-immunity-bone axis-associated pathophysiology of osteoporosis, but also demonstrate the high potential of GH01 for osteoporosis treatment by targeting the gut-bone signaling axis.",2023-06-25
37366253,The adipose-derived stem cell peptide ADSCP2 alleviates hypertrophic scar fibrosis via binding with pyruvate carboxylase and remodeling the metabolic landscape.,The purpose of this study was to investigate the function and mechanism of a novel peptide derived from adipose-derived stem cell-conditioned medium (ADSC-CM).,2023-06-27
37364619,A novel peptide able to reduce PLA<sub>2</sub> activity and modulate inflammatory cytokine production.,"Phospholipases A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>s) are associated with inflammatory response, performing a complex process involving, specially, cytokines. The excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines induces a chronic inflammatory response and can cause several disorders in the body. Therefore, the inhibition or regulation of cytokines' signaling pathways is a target for new treatment development strategies. Thus, this study aimed to select PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor mimetic peptides through phage display technology with anti-inflammatory activity. Specific mimetic peptides were selected using BpPLA2-TXI, a PLA<sub>2</sub> isolated from Bothrops pauloensis, as a target, and γCdcPL, a PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor isolated from Crotalus durissus collilineatus, which was used as a competitor during the elution step. We selected the peptide C2PD, which seems to play a pivotal role in the modulation of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-10 cytokines in inflammatory cells. The C2PD showed a significant reduction in PLA<sub>2</sub> activity. Furthermore, the synthetic peptide was tested in PBMC and showed a significant down-modulation of IL-6 and IL-1β release, whereas IL-10 responses were up-regulated. Our findings suggest that this novel peptide may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, mainly due to its anti-inflammatory properties and absence of cytotoxicity.",2023-06-25
37360982,A novel dual NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.,"Inflammasomes induce maturation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, whose activity is associated with the pathophysiology of a wide range of infectious and inflammatory diseases. As validated therapeutic targets for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, there has been intense interest in developing small-molecule inhibitors to target inflammasome activity and reduce disease-associated inflammatory burden.",2023-06-22
37351549,Solvated interaction energy: from small-molecule to antibody drug design.,"Scoring functions are ubiquitous in structure-based drug design as an aid to predicting binding modes and estimating binding affinities. Ideally, a scoring function should be broadly applicable, obviating the need to recalibrate and refit its parameters for every new target and class of ligands. Traditionally, drugs have been small molecules, but in recent years biologics, particularly antibodies, have become an increasingly important if not dominant class of therapeutics. This makes the goal of having a transferable scoring function, i.e., one that spans the range of small-molecule to protein ligands, even more challenging. One such broadly applicable scoring function is the Solvated Interaction Energy (SIE), which has been developed and applied in our lab for the last 15 years, leading to several important applications. This physics-based method arose from efforts to understand the physics governing binding events, with particular care given to the role played by solvation. SIE has been used by us and many independent labs worldwide for virtual screening and discovery of novel small-molecule binders or optimization of known drugs. Moreover, without any retraining, it is found to be transferrable to predictions of antibody-antigen relative binding affinities and as accurate as functions trained on protein-protein binding affinities. SIE has been incorporated in conjunction with other scoring functions into ADAPT (Assisted Design of Antibody and Protein Therapeutics), our platform for affinity modulation of antibodies. Application of ADAPT resulted in the optimization of several antibodies with 10-to-100-fold improvements in binding affinity. Further applications included broadening the specificity of a single-domain antibody to be cross-reactive with virus variants of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and the design of safer antibodies by engineering of a pH switch to make them more selective towards acidic tumors while sparing normal tissues at physiological pH.",2023-06-07
37350944,Anti-HPV16 oncoproteins siRNA therapy for cervical cancer using a novel transdermal peptide PKU12.,"In this study, an innovative transdermal peptide, #PKU12, was developed based on transdermal peptide TD-1, and the anti-tumor effect of PKU12-based siRNA against HPV was investigated <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, transcriptome differences between PKU12 + siRNA treatment and control groups were compared to assess treatment effects. The top five upregulated and downregulated genes identified by RNA sequencing were further subjected to survival analysis. The present study, for the first time, showed that this novel peptide could enhance the transdermal delivery of the siRNA targeting HPV16 L1, E6, and E7. PKU12-based siRNA delivery significantly repressed the mRNA expression levels of HPV16 L1, E6, and E7 in the SiHa xenograft tumors and attenuated tumor growth as well. The RNA-sequencing results showed that a total of 586 DEGs were detected in the PKU12 + siRNA-treated tumor tissues compared to the control tumor tissues. The GSEA analysis revealed that DEGs were inversely associated with the HIF-1 signaling pathway, the TNF signaling pathway, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, ferroptosis, the IL-17 signaling pathway, ovarian steroidogenesis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Further functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were significantly enriched in several key pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the TNF signaling pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. High expression of MYH1, MYH4, FGG, DEPP1, and ZBTB16 was associated with shorter overall survival of patients with cervical cancer; high expression of SULT1E1, RAB3C, CXCR3, and PROX2 was associated with longer overall survival of patients with cervical cancer. In conclusion, the transdermal peptide PKU12 is potentially a good candidate for a siRNA delivery vehicle for the treatment of cervical cancer.",2023-06-07
37332141,A novel peptide derived from the mannose binding lectin inhibits LPS-activated TLR4/NF-κB signaling and suppresses ocular inflammation.,"Uveitis is a major cause of vision impairment worldwide. Current treatments have limited effectiveness but severe complications. Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is an important protein of the innate immune system that binds to TLR4 and suppresses LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine secretion. MBL-mediated inhibition of inflammation via the TLR4 pathway and MBL-derived peptides might be a potential therapeutics. In this study, we designed a novel MBL-derived peptide, WP-17, targeting TLR4. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted for the sequence, structure and biological properties of WP-17. The binding of WP-17 to THP-1 cells was analyzed using flow cytometry. Signaling molecules were analyzed by western blotting, and activation of NF-κB was measured by immunofluorescence-histochemical analysis. Effects of WP-17 were studied in vitro using LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells and in vivo in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). Our results showed that WP-17 could bind to TLR4 expressed on macrophages, thus downregulating the expression levels of MyD88, IRAK-4, and TRAF-6, and inhibiting the downstream NF-kB signaling pathway and LPS-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in THP-1 cells. Moreover, in EIU rats, intravitreal pretreatment with WP-17 demonstrated significant inhibitory effects on ocular inflammation, attenuating the clinical and histopathological manifestations of uveitis, reducing protein leakage and cell infiltration into the aqueous humor, and suppressing TNF-α and IL-6 production in ocular tissues. In summary, our study provides the first evidence of a novel MBL-derived peptide that suppressed activation of the NF-кB pathway by targeting TLR4. The peptide effectively inhibited rat uveitis and may be a promising candidate for the management of ocular inflammatory diseases.",2023-06-18

37316917,Cerebral Semaphorin3D is a novel risk factor for age-associated cognitive impairment.,"We previously reported that miR-195 exerts neuroprotection by inhibiting Sema3A and cerebral miR-195 levels decreased with age, both of which urged us to explore the role of miR-195 and miR-195-regulated Sema3 family members in age-associated dementia.",2023-06-14
37307715,Targeting the Hedgehog pathway with novel Gli1 hydrophobic tagging degraders.,"The Hedgehog/Glioma-associated oncogene (Hh/Gli) signaling pathway plays an essential role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Aberrant regulation of this pathway has been linked to various human malignancies. Gli1, the downstream transcription factor of the Hh pathway, is the ultimate effector of the canonical Hh pathway and has been identified as a common regulator of several tumorigenic pathways prevalent in Hh-independent cancers. Thus Gli1 represents a unique and promising drug target for a wide range of cancers. However, the identification and development of small molecules that directly target Gli1 protein have progressed slowly, due to an insufficient efficacy and selectivity. Herein, we developed novel small-molecule Gli1 degraders based on the hydrophobic tagging (HyT) strategy. The Gli1 HyT degrader 8e potently inhibited the proliferation of Gli1-overexpressed HT29 colorectal cancer cells, induced Gli1 degradation with a DC<sub>50</sub> value of 5.4 μM in HT29 and achieved 70% degradation at 7.5 μM in MEF<sup>PTCH1-/-</sup> and MEF<sup>SUFU-/-</sup>cell lines, via proteasome pathway. Compared to the canonical Hh antagonist Vismodegib, 8e exhibited much stronger potency in suppressing the mRNA expression of Hh target genes in Hh-overactivated MEF<sup>PTCH1-/-</sup> and Vismodegib resistant MEF<sup>SUFU-/-</sup> cells. Our study provides small molecule Gli1 degraders effectively interfering with both canonical and noncanonical Hh signaling and overcoming current Smoothened (SMO) antagonists resistance, which might pave a new avenue for developing therapeutic modalities targeting Hh/Gli1 signaling pathway.",2023-06-07
37304671,"Anticancer efficacy of 3-(4-isopropyl) benzylidene-8-ethoxy, 6-methyl, chroman-4-one (SBL-060), a novel, dual, estrogen receptor-Akt kinase inhibitor in acute myeloid leukemia cells.","Estrogen receptor (ER) α is expressed in a subset of patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, whereas Akt is predominantly expressed in most types of AML. Targeting AML with dual inhibitors is a novel approach to combat the disease. Herein, we examined a novel small molecule, 3-(4-isopropyl) benzylidene-8-ethoxy,6-methyl, chroman-4-one (SBL-060), capable of targeting AML cells by inhibiting ERα and Akt kinase. The chemical properties of SBL-060 were identified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR), <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, and mass spectroscopy. <i>In silico</i> docking was performed using an automated protocol with AutoDock-VINA. THP-1 and HL-60 cell lines were differentiated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. ERα inhibition was assessed using ELISA. The MTT assay assessed cell viability. Flow cytometry was performed for cell cycle, apoptosis, and p-Akt analyses. Chemical analysis identified the compound as 3-(4-isopropyl) benzylidene-8-ethoxy,6-methyl, chroman-4-one, which showed high binding efficacy toward ER, with a ΔG<sub>binding</sub> score of -7.4 kcal/mol. SBL-060 inhibited ERα, exhibiting IC<sub>50</sub> values of 448 and 374.3 nM in THP-1 and HL-60 cells, respectively. Regarding inhibited cell proliferation, GI<sub>50</sub> values of SBL-060 were 244.1 and 189.9 nM for THP-1 and HL-60 cells, respectively. In addition, a dose-dependent increase in sub G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase cell cycle arrest and total apoptosis was observed after treatment with SBL-060 in both cell types. SBL-060 also dose-dependently increased the p-Akt-positive populations in both THP-1 and HL-60 cells. Our results indicate that SBL-060 has excellent efficacy against differentiated AML cell types by inhibiting ER and Akt kinase, warranting further preclinical evaluations.",2022-08-01
37298177,Progress towards Adjuvant Development: Focus on Antiviral Therapy.,"In recent decades, vaccines have been extraordinary resources to prevent pathogen diffusion and cancer. Even if they can be formed by a single antigen, the addition of one or more adjuvants represents the key to enhance the response of the immune signal to the antigen, thus accelerating and increasing the duration and the potency of the protective effect. Their use is of particular importance for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or immunocompromised people. Despite their importance, only in the last forty years has the search for novel adjuvants increased, with the discovery of novel classes of immune potentiators and immunomodulators. Due to the complexity of the cascades involved in immune signal activation, their mechanism of action remains poorly understood, even if significant discovery has been recently made thanks to recombinant technology and metabolomics. This review focuses on the classes of adjuvants under research, recent mechanism of action studies, as well as nanodelivery systems and novel classes of adjuvants that can be chemically manipulated to create novel small molecule adjuvants.",2023-05-25
37290962,Hexahydroquinoline Derivatives Are Selective Agonists for the Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor ADGRG1/GPR56.,"GPR56 is a widely expressed adhesion GPCR (AGPCR) that has pleotropic roles in brain development, platelet function, cancer, and more. Nearly all AGPCRs possess extracellular regions that bind protein ligands and conceal a cryptic tethered peptide agonist. AGPCR reception of mechanical or shear force is thought to release the tethered agonist permitting its binding to the AGPCR orthosteric site for consequent activation of G protein signaling. This multistep mechanism of AGPCR activation is difficult to target, emphasizing the need for tool compounds and potential therapeutics that modulate AGPCRs directly. We expanded our cell-based pilot screen for GPR56 small molecule activators to screen >200,000 compounds and identified two promising agonists: 2-(furan-2-yl)-1-[(4-phenylphenyl)carbonyl]pyrrolidine, or compound 4, and propan-2-yl-4-(2-bromophenyl)-2,7,7-trimethyl-5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline-3-carboxylate, or compound 36. Both compounds activated GPR56 receptors enginered to have impaired tethered agonists and/or be cleavage deficient. Compound 4 activated a subset of group VIII AGPCRs while compound 36 had exclusive specificity for GPR56 among the GPCRs tested. Compound 36 SAR analysis identified an analog with the isopropyl R group replaced with a cyclopentyl ring and the electrophilic bromine replaced with a CF<sub>3</sub> group. Analog 36.40 had 40% increased potency over compound 36 and was 20-fold more potent than synthetic peptidomimetics designed from the GPR56 tethered agonist. The new GPCR56 tool compounds discovered in this screen may be used to further advance understanding of GPR56 function and aid development of AGPCR-targeted therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Adhesion G protein coupled receptors (AGPCRs) are a large, clinically relevant class of GPCRs with no available therapeutics, in part due to their unique mechanism of activation. GPR56 is a widely expressed model AGPCR involved in cancer metastasis, hemostasis, and neuron myelination. In the present study, we identified novel small molecule agonists for GPR56. These molecules are among the most potent identified thus far and may become useful leads in the development of a GPR56-targeted therapeutic.",2023-06-08
37288718,A Brief Guide to Preparing a Peptide-Drug Conjugate.,"Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) have recently emerged as interesting hybrid constructs not only for targeted therapy, but also for the early diagnosis of different pathologies. In most cases, the crucial step in the PDC synthesis is the final conjugation step, where a specific drug is bound to a particular peptide-/peptidomimetic-targeting unit. Thus, this concept paper aims to give a short guide to determining the finest conjugation reaction, by considering in particular the reaction conditions, the stability of the linker and the major pros and cons of each reaction. Based on the recent PDCs reported in literature, the most common and efficient conjugation methods will be systematically presented and compared, generating a short guide to consult while planning the synthesis of a novel peptide-drug conjugate.",2023-07-31
37271075,Not all benzimidazole derivatives are microtubule destabilizing agents.,"In recent years, microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) have gained considerable interest in developing novel small-molecule anticancer drugs. MTAs demonstrate anticancer activity either as microtubule-stabilizing agents (paclitaxel) or microtubule-destabilizing agents (nocodazole). FDA-approved drugs containing a benzimidazole ring (nocodazole, albendazole, mebendazole, etc.) are well-known microtubule-destabilizing agents. Thus, most recent research on benzimidazole scaffold-based MTAs focuses on developing microtubule-destabilizing agents. However, there is no report on the benzimidazole scaffold-based microtubule-stabilizing agent. Here, we present the benzimidazole derivatives NI-11 and NI-18 that showed a profound anticancer activity as microtubule-stabilization agents. About twenty benzimidazole analogues were synthesized with excellent yield (80.0% ∼ 98.0%) and tested for their anticancer activity using two cancer cell lines (A549, MCF-7) and one normal cell line (MRC-5). NI-11 showed IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.90, 7.17, and 16.9 µM in A549, MCF-7, and MRC-5 cell lines. NI-18 showed IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.33, 6.10, and 12.1 µM in A549, MCF-7, and MRC-5 cell lines. Thus, NI-11 and NI-18 demonstrated selectivity indexes of 5.81 and 5.20, respectively, which are much higher than the currently available anticancer agents. NI-11 and NI-18 inhibited the cancer cell motility and migration, induced the early phase apoptosis. Both of these comounds were found to show an upregulation of DeY-α-tubulin and downregulation of Ac-α-tubulin expressions in cancer cells. Eventhough the reported benzimidazole scaffold-based commercially available drugs are known to be microtubule-destabilizing agents, the analogues NI-11 and NI-18 were found to have microtubule-stabilizing activity. The in vitro tubulin polymerization assay and the immunofluorescence assay results indicate that the NI-11 and NI-18 exhibit anticancer activity by stabilizing the microtubule network.",2023-06-02
37269594,Rev-erbα agonists suppresses TGFβ1-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and pro-fibrotic phenotype in human lung fibroblasts.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive scarring of the lungs that can lead to respiratory failure and death. Lungs of patients with IPF demonstrate excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and an increased presence of pro-fibrotic mediators such as transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFβ1), which is a major driver of fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). Current literature supports that circadian clock dysfunction plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of various chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and IPF. The circadian clock transcription factor Rev-erbα is encoded by Nr1d1 that regulates daily rhythms of gene expression linked to immunity, inflammation, and metabolism. However, investigations into the potential roles of Rev-erbα in TGFβ-induced FMT and ECM accumulation are limited. In this study, we utilized several novel small molecule Rev-erbα agonists (GSK41122, SR9009, and SR9011) and a Rev-erbα antagonist (SR8278) to determine the roles of Rev-erbα in regulating TGFβ1-induced FMT and pro-fibrotic phenotypes in human lung fibroblasts. WI-38 cells were either pre-treated/co-treated with or without Rev-erbα agonist/antagonist along with TGFβ1. After 48 h, the following parameters were evaluated: secretion of COL1A1 (Slot-Blot analysis) and IL-6 (ELISA) into condition media, expressions of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA: immunostaining and confocal microscopy), and pro-fibrotic proteins (αSMA and COL1A1 by immunoblotting), as well as gene expression of pro-fibrotic targets (qRT-PCR: Acta2, Fn1, and Col1a1). Results revealed that Rev-erbα agonists inhibited TGFβ1-induced FMT (αSMA and COL1A1), and ECM production (reduced gene expression of Acta2, Fn1, and Col1a1), and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 release. The Rev-erbα antagonist promoted TGFβ1-induced pro-fibrotic phenotypes. These findings support the potential of novel circadian clock-based therapeutics, such as Rev-erbα agonist, for the treatment and management of fibrotic lung diseases and disorders.",2023-05-24

Previously, Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) 1 has been implicated in lipotoxic signaling in hepatocytes in vitro and high-fat diet-induced lipogenesis in vivo. However, whether ROCK1 plays a role in liver inflammation and fibrosis during NASH is unclear. Here, we hypothesized that pathogenic activation of ROCK1 promotes murine NASH pathogenesis.",2023-06-02
37247257,Specific Clearance of Lipopolysaccharide from Blood Based on Peptide Bottlebrush Polymer for Sepsis Therapy.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the primary bacterial toxin that is vital to the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis associated with extremely high morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood is highly challenging because of the structural complexity and its variation between/within bacterial species. Herein, a robust strategy based on phage display screening and hemocompatible peptide bottlebrush polymer design for specific clearance of targeted LPS from circulating blood is proposed. Using LPS extracted from Escherichia coli as an example, a novel peptide (HWKAVNWLKPWT) with high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> < 1.0 nм), specificity, and neutralization activity (95.9 ± 0.1%) against the targeted LPS is discovered via iterative affinity selection coupled with endotoxin detoxification screening. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing the short peptide [poly(PEGMEA-co-PEP-1)] exhibits high LPS selectivity to reduce circulating LPS level from 2.63 ± 0.01 to 0.78 ± 0.05 EU mL<sup>-1</sup> in sepsis rabbits via extracorporeal hemoperfusion (LPS clearance ratio > 70%), reversing the LPS-induced leukocytopenia and multiple organ damages significantly. This work provides a universal paradigm for developing a highly selective hemoadsorbent library fully covering the LPS family, which is promising to create a new era of precision medicine in sepsis therapy.",2023-07-05
37244126,Development of an assay pipeline for the discovery of novel small molecule inhibitors of human glutathione peroxidases GPX1 and GPX4.,"Selenoprotein glutathione peroxidases (GPX), like ubiquitously expressed GPX1 and the ferroptosis modulator GPX4, enact antioxidant activities by reducing hydroperoxides using glutathione. Overexpression of these enzymes is common in cancer and can be associated with the development of resistance to chemotherapy. GPX1 and GPX4 inhibitors have thus shown promise as anti-cancer agents, and targeting other GPX isoforms may prove equally beneficial. Existing inhibitors are often promiscuous, or modulate GPXs only indirectly, so novel direct inhibitors identified through screening against GPX1 and GPX4 could be valuable. Here, we developed optimized glutathione reductase (GR)-coupled GPX assays for the biochemical high-throughput screen (HTS) of almost 12,000 compounds with proposed mechanisms of action. Initial hits were triaged using a GR counter-screen, assessed for isoform specificity against an additional GPX isoform, GPX2, and were assessed for general selenocysteine-targeting activity using a thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD1) assay. Importantly, 70% of the GPX1 inhibitors identified in the primary screen, including several cephalosporin antibiotics, were found to also inhibit TXNRD1, while auranofin, previously known as a TXNRD1 inhibitor, also inhibited GPX1 (but not GPX4). Additionally, every GPX1 inhibitor identified (including omapatrilat, tenatoprazole, cefoxitin and ceftibuten) showed similar inhibitory activity against GPX2. Some compounds inhibiting GPX4 but not GPX1 or GPX2, also inhibited TXNRD1 (26%). Compounds only inhibiting GPX4 included pranlukast sodium hydrate, lusutrombopag, brilanestrant, simeprevir, grazoprevir (MK-5172), paritaprevir, navitoclax, venetoclax and VU0661013. Two compounds (metamizole sodium and isoniazid sodium methanesulfate) inhibited all three GPXs but not TXNRD1, while 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate, PI4KIII beta inhibitor 3, SCE-2174 and cefotetan sodium inhibited all tested selenoproteins (but not GR). The detected overlaps in chemical space suggest that the counter screens introduced here should be imperative for identification of specific GPX inhibitors. With this approach, we could indeed identify novel GPX1/GPX2- or GPX4-specific inhibitors, thus presenting a validated pipeline for future identification of specific selenoprotein-targeting agents. Our study also identified GPX1/GPX2, GPX4 and/or TXNRD1 as targets for several previously developed pharmacologically active compounds.",2023-05-16
37242488,"Development of Novel Small-Molecule Activators of Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Isozyme 2, PKM2, to Reduce Photoreceptor Apoptosis.","Treatment options are lacking to prevent photoreceptor death and subsequent vision loss. Previously, we demonstrated that reprogramming metabolism via the pharmacologic activation of PKM2 is a novel photoreceptor neuroprotective strategy. However, the features of the tool compound used in those studies, ML-265, preclude its advancement as an intraocular, clinical candidate. This study sought to develop the next generation of small-molecule PKM2 activators, aimed specifically for delivery into the eye. Compounds were developed that replaced the thienopyrrolopyridazinone core of ML-265 and modified the aniline and methyl sulfoxide functional groups. Compound <b>2</b> demonstrated that structural changes to the ML-265 scaffold are tolerated from a potency and efficacy standpoint, allow for a similar binding mode to the target, and circumvent apoptosis in models of outer retinal stress. To overcome the low solubility and problematic functional groups of ML-265, compound <b>2</b>'s efficacious and versatile core structure for the incorporation of diverse functional groups was then utilized to develop novel PKM2 activators with improved solubility, lack of structural alerts, and retained potency. No other molecules are in the pharmaceutical pipeline for the metabolic reprogramming of photoreceptors. Thus, this study is the first to cultivate the next generation of novel, structurally diverse, small-molecule PKM2 activators for delivery into the eye.",2023-05-06
37232088,A novel peptide derived from <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i> residue exhibits anti-aging activity in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans via</i> the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway.,"To explore the value of <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i> (<i>H. pluvialis</i>) residue remaining after astaxanthin extraction and being discarded uneconomically, in our previous study, we discovered a novel peptide (HPp) as a potential bioactive component. However, the possible anti-aging activity <i>in vivo</i> was not illuminated. In this study, the capacity of extending the lifespan and the mechanism based on <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) were determined. The results showed that 100 μM HPp not only enhanced the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i> in normal environments by 20.96% but also strengthened the lifespan in oxidative and thermal conditions effectively. Moreover, HPp succeeded in lessening the decline in physiological functions of aging worms. In terms of antioxidant efficacy, SOD and CAT enzyme activity were promoted, but the level of MDA was diminished significantly after HPp treatment. Subsequent analysis directly reflected the relationship between higher stress resistance and up-regulation of <i>skn-1</i> and <i>hsp-16.2</i>, and between greater antioxidant ability and up-regulation of <i>sod-3</i> and <i>ctl-2</i>. Further studies illustrated that HPp up-graded the mRNA transcription of the genes associated with the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway and some co-factors, including <i>daf-16</i>, <i>daf-2</i>, <i>ins-18</i>, and <i>sir-2.1</i>. Particularly, the activation of the IIS pathway required the regulation of subcellular localization of DAF-16/FOXO. Taken together, HPp could promote longevity with improved stress resistance and antioxidant properties <i>in vivo</i> through the IIS pathway. These data suggested that HPp might serve as a good source of anti-aging actives, and in particular, laid a foundation for the high value-added application of marine microalgae.",2023-06-19
37217546,Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) regulates the glucocorticoid signaling pathway during the early phase of adipogenesis.,"Obesity is associated with adipose tissue dysfunction through the differentiation and expansion of pre-adipocytes to adipocytes (hyperplasia) and/or increases in size of pre-existing adipocytes (hypertrophy). A cascade of transcriptional events coordinates the differentiation of pre-adipocytes into fully differentiated adipocytes; the process of adipogenesis. Although nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) has been associated with obesity, how NNMT is regulated during adipogenesis, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms, remain undefined. In present study we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to elucidate the molecular signals driving NNMT activation and its role during adipogenesis. Firstly, we demonstrated that during the early phase of adipocyte differentiation NNMT is transactivated by CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein beta (CEBPB) in response to glucocorticoid (GC) induction. We found that Nnmt knockout, using CRISPR/Cas9 approach, impaired terminal adipogenesis by influencing the timing of cellular commitment and cell cycle exit during mitotic clonal expansion, as demonstrated by cell cycle analysis and RNA sequencing experiments. Biochemical and computational methods showed that a novel small molecule, called CC-410, stably binds to and highly specifically inhibits NNMT. CC-410 was, therefore, used to modulate protein activity during pre-adipocyte differentiation stages, demonstrating that, in line with the genetic approach, chemical inhibition of NNMT at the early stages of adipogenesis impairs terminal differentiation by deregulating the GC network. These congruent results conclusively demonstrate that NNMT is a key component of the GC-CEBP axis during the early stages of adipogenesis and could be a potential therapeutic target for both early-onset obesity and glucocorticoid-induced obesity.",2023-05-22
37210727,MasR and pGCA receptor activation protects primary vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells against oxidative stress via inhibition of intracellular calcium.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are associated with vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) and endothelial cell (EC) damage. Angiotensin1-7 (Ang1-7) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are responsible for vasodilation and regulation of blood flow. These protective effects of BNP are primarily mediated by the activation of sGCs/cGMP/cGKI pathway. Conversely, Ang1-7 inhibits Angiotensin II-induced contraction and oxidative stress via Mas receptor activation. Thus, the aim of the study was to determine the effect of co-activation of MasR and particulate guanylate cyclase receptor (pGCA) pathways by synthesized novel peptide (NP) in oxidative stress-induced VSMCs and ECs. MTT and Griess reagent assay kits were used for the standardization of the oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) induced model in VSMCs. The expression of targeted receptors in VSMC was done by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Protective effect of NP in VSMC and EC was determined by immunocytochemistry, FACS analysis, and Western blot analysis. Underlying mechanisms of EC-dependent VSMC relaxation were done by determining downstream mRNA gene expression and intracellular calcium imaging of cells. Synthesized NP significantly improved oxidative stress-induced injury in VSMCs. Remarkably, the actions of NP were superior to that of the Ang1-7 and BNP alone. Further, a mechanistic study in VSMC and EC suggested the involvement of upstream mediators of calcium inhibition for the therapeutic effect. NP is reported to possess vascular protective activities and is also involved in the improvement of endothelial damage. Moreover, it is highly effective than that of individual peptides BNP and Ang1-7 and therefore it may represent a promising strategy for CVDs.",2023-05-21
37209612,"Optimization, and biological evaluation of 3-O-β-chacotriosyl betulinic acid amide derivatives as novel small-molecule Omicron.","SARS-CoV-2 Omicron viruses possess a high antigenic shift, and the approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs are extremely limited, which makes the development of new antiviral drugs for the clinical treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks imperative. We have previously discovered a new series of markedly potent small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 virus entry, exampled by the hit compound 2. Here, we report a further study of bioisosteric replacement of the eater linker at the C-17 position of 2 with a variety of aromatic amine moieties, followed by a focused structure-activity relationship study, leading to the discovery of a series of novel 3-O-β-chacotriosyl BA amide derivatives as small-molecule Omicron fusion inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity index. Particularly, our medicinal chemistry efforts have resulted in a potent, and efficacious lead compound S-10 with appreciable pharmacokinetic properties, which exhibited broad-spectrum potency against Omicron and other variants with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.82 to 5.45 μM. Mutagenesis studies confirmed that inhibition of Omicron viral entry was mediated by the direct interaction with S in the prefusion state. These results reveal that S-10 is suitable for further optimization as Omicron fusion inhibitors, with the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents for the treatment and control of SARS-CoV-2 ant its variants infections.",2023-05-15
37200310,Oxalic acid blocked the binding of spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants to human angiotensin-converting enzymes 2.,"An epidemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading worldwide. Moreover, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, such as Delta and Omicron, has seriously challenged the application of current therapeutics including vaccination and drugs. Relying on interaction of spike protein with receptor angiotensin-converting enzymes 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV-2 successfully invades to the host cells, which indicates a strategy that identification of small-molecular compounds to block the entry is of great significance for COVID-19 prevention. Our study evaluated the potential efficacy of natural compound oxalic acid (OA) as an inhibitory agent against SARS-CoV-2 invasion, particular on the interaction of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Delta and Omicron variants to ACE2. By employing a competitive binding assay in vitro, OA significantly blocked the binding of RBDs from Delta B.1.617.2 and Omicron B.1.1.529 to ACE2, but has no effect on the wide-type SARS-CoV-2 strain. Furthermore, OA inhibited the entries of Delta and Omicron pseudovirus into ACE2 high expressing-HEK293T cells. By surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, the direct bindings of OA to RBD and ACE2 were analyzed and OA had both affinities with RBDs of B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529 and with ACE2. Molecular docking predicted the binding sites on the RBD-ACE2 complex and it showed similar binding abilities to both complex of variant Delta or Omicron RBD and ACE2. In conclusion, we provided a promising novel small-molecule compound OA as an antiviral candidate by blocking the cellular entries of SARS-CoV-2 variants.",2023-05-18
37174654,A Novel CD206 Targeting Peptide Inhibits Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Mice.,"Activated M2-polarized macrophages are drivers of pulmonary fibrosis in several clinical scenarios, including Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). In this study, we investigated the effects of targeting the CD206 receptor in M2-like macrophages with a novel synthetic analogue of a naturally occurring Host Defense Peptide (HDP), RP-832c, to decrease profibrotic cytokines. RP-832c selectively binds to CD206 on M2-polarized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) in vitro, resulting in a time-dependent decrease in CD206 expression and a transient increase in M1-macrophage marker TNF-α. To elucidate the antifibrotic effects of RP-832c, we used a murine model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced early-stage pulmonary fibrosis. RP-832c significantly reduced fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased CD206, TGF-β1, and α-SMA expression in mouse lungs. Similarly, in an established model of lung fibrosis, RP-832c significantly decreased lung fibrosis and significantly decreased inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, CXCL1/2, and fibrosis markers TGF-β1 and MMP-13. In comparison with the FDA-approved drugs Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, RP-832c exhibited a similar reduction in fibrosis compared to Pirfenidone, and to a greater extent than Nintedanib, with no apparent toxicities observed. In summary, our findings showed that inhibiting the profibrotic alternatively activated M2-like macrophages using a novel peptide, RP-832c, could reduce BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, warranting the therapeutic potential of this peptide for patients with pulmonary fibrosis.",2023-04-26
37171714,Marine drugs as putative inhibitors against non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2: an in silico study.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented pandemic, threatening human health worldwide. The need to produce novel small-molecule inhibitors against the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the use of drugs such as chloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone, favipiravir, ribavirin, remdesivir and azithromycin. Moreover, the reports of the clinical trials of these drugs proved to produce detrimental effects on patients with side effects like nephrotoxicity, retinopathy, cardiotoxicity and cardiomyopathy. Recognizing the need for effective and non-harmful therapeutic candidates to combat COVID-19, we aimed to develop promising drugs against SARS-COV-2.",2023-05-12
37171455,Toward discovering a novel family of peptides targeting neuroinflammatory states of brain microglia and astrocytes.,"Microglia are immune-derived cells critical to the development and healthy function of the brain and spinal cord, yet are implicated in the active pathology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. A range of functional phenotypes associated with the healthy brain or disease states has been suggested from in vivo work and were modeled in vitro as surveying, reactive, and primed sub-types of primary rat microglia and mixed microglia/astrocytes. It was hypothesized that the biomolecular profile of these cells undergoes a phenotypical change as well, and these functional phenotypes were explored for potential novel peptide binders using a custom 7 amino acid-presenting M13 phage library (SX7) to identify unique peptides that bind differentially to these respective cell types. Surveying glia were untreated, reactive were induced with a lipopolysaccharide treatment, recovery was modeled with a potent anti-inflammatory treatment dexamethasone, and priming was determined by subsequently challenging the cells with interferon gamma. Microglial function was profiled by determining the secretion of cytokines and nitric oxide, and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. After incubation with the SX7 phage library, populations of SX7-positive microglia and/or astrocytes were collected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, SX7 phage was amplified in Escherichia coli culture, and phage DNA was sequenced via next-generation sequencing. Binding validation was done with synthesized peptides via in-cell westerns. Fifty-eight unique peptides were discovered, and their potential functions were assessed using a basic local alignment search tool. Peptides potentially originated from proteins ranging in function from a variety of supportive glial roles, including synapse support and pruning, to inflammatory incitement including cytokine and interleukin activation, and potential regulation in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.",2023-06-14
37166296,Small-Molecule Compound CY-158-11 Inhibits Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Formation.,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen and brings about many community-acquired, hospital-acquired, and biofilm-associated infections worldwide. It tends to form biofilms, triggering the release of toxins and initiating resistance mechanisms. As a result of the development of S. aureus tolerance to antibiotics, there are few drugs can availably control biofilm-associated infections. In this study, we synthesized a novel small-molecule compound CY-158-11 (C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>14</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>) and proved its inhibitory effect on the biofilm formation of S. aureus at a subinhibitory concentration (1/8 MIC). The subinhibitory concentration of CY-158-11 not only did not affect the growth of bacteria but also had no toxicity to A549 cells or G. mellonella. Total biofilm biomass was investigated by crystal violet staining, and the results were confirmed by SYTO 9 and PI staining through confocal laser scanning microscopy. Moreover, CY-158-11 effectively prevented initial attachment and repressed the production of PIA instead of autolysis. RT-qPCR analysis also exhibited significant suppression of the genes involved in biofilm formation. Taken together, CY-158-11 exerted its inhibitory effects against the biofilm formation in S. aureus by inhibiting cell adhesion and the expression of <i>icaA</i> related to PIA production. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Most bacteria exist in the form of biofilms, often strongly adherent to various surfaces, causing bacterial resistance and chronic infections. In general, antibacterial drugs are not effective against biofilms. The small-molecule compound CY-158-11 inhibited the biofilm formation of S. aureus at a subinhibitory concentration. By hindering adhesion and PIA-mediated biofilm formation, CY-158-11 exhibits antibiofilm activity toward S. aureus. These findings point to a novel therapeutic agent for combating intractable S. aureus-biofilm-related infections.",2023-05-11
37162249,A Nanovaccine Based on Adjuvant Peptide FK-13 and l-Phenylalanine Poly(ester amide) Enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cell-Mediated Antitumor Immunity.,"Cancer vaccines have shown promise as effective means of antitumor immunotherapy by inducing tumor antigen-specific T cell immunity. In this study, a novel peptide-based tumor nanovaccine that boosts antigen presentation and elicits effective antitumor immunity is developed. The adjuvant characteristics of an antimicrobial peptide-derived core peptide, FK-13, are investigated and used it to generate a fusion peptide named FK-33 with tumor antigen epitopes. l-phenylalanine-based poly(ester amide) (Phe-PEA), 8p4, is also identified as a competent delivery vehicle for the fusion peptide FK-33. Notably, the vaccination of 8p4 + FK-33 nanoparticles (8FNs) in vivo induces dendritic cell activation in the lymph nodes and elicits robust tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. The nanovaccine 8FNs demonstrate significant therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against in situ tumor growth, effectively inhibit tumor metastasis, and significantly prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, 8FNs can incorporate different tumor antigens and exhibit a synergistic therapeutic effect with antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. In summary, 8FNs represent a promising platform for personalized cancer vaccines and may serve as a potential combinational modality to improve current immunotherapy.",2023-05-10
37154295,Targeting TGF beta receptor 1 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"The transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-ß) pathway may be involved in the radioresistance of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

37148978,Identification of a novel small-molecule inhibitor targeting TIM-3 for cancer immunotherapy.,"PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has achieved substantial clinical results in cancer treatment. However, the expression of other immune checkpoints leads to resistance and hinders the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), a non-redundant immune checkpoint, synergizes with PD-1 to mediate T cell dysfunction in tumor microenvironment. Development of small molecules targeting TIM-3 is a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Here, to identify small molecule inhibitors targeting TIM-3, the docking pocket in TIM-3 was analyzed by Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) and the Chemdiv compound database was screened. The small molecule SMI402 could bind to TIM-3 with high affinity and prevent the ligation of PtdSer, HMGB1, and CEACAM1. SMI402 reinvigorated T cell function in vitro. In the MC38-bearing mouse model, SMI402 inhibited tumor growth by increasing CD8<sup>+</sup> T and natural killing (NK) cells infiltration at the tumor site, as well as restoring the function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells. In conclusions, the small molecule SMI402 shows promise as a leading compound which targets TIM-3 for cancer immunotherapy.",2023-05-04
37119975,Effectiveness of analog of Humanin in ameliorating streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy in Sprague Dawley rats.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with numerous complications, including nephropathy, which principally occur due to hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. Humanin (HN), a novel peptide generated from mitochondria, has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential as observed in different disease models. However, role of HN in diabetic nephropathy (DN) has not yet been explored. This study aimed to evaluate biochemical and molecular aspects of the effects of HN analog, Humanin-glycine ([S14G]-humanin) on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of DN. Ninety Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly segregated into three groups - A (control), B (disease control) and C (treatment). DM type-I was induced in group B and C via single intra-peritoneal dose of STZ (45 mg/Kg). Seven days following STZ injection, rats were deemed diabetic if their blood glucose level was > 250 mg/dL. Subsequently, diabetic rats in group C were injected with [S14G]-humanin intra-peritoneally (0.4 mg/Kg/day) for sixteen weeks. Biochemical analysis revealed that diabetic rats had markedly elevated levels of serum glucose, creatinine, BUN, TNF-α, and kidney tissue SOD. Whereas, significant decline was detected in serum insulin and albumin levels. All these parameters were significantly reversed in group C after administering [S14G]-humanin. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis displayed up-regulation of pro-inflammatory (IL-18, IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α) and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-1RN, IL-4) in diabetic rats (group B). [S14G]-humanin treatment significantly reversed the expression of IL-18 and IL-1α, however, change in relative expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokines was insignificant (group C). Conclusively, the findings of this study depicted potential therapeutic role of [S14G]-humanin in pre-clinical rodent model of DN.",2023-04-28
37111759,High-Throughput/High Content Imaging Screen Identifies Novel Small Molecule Inhibitors and Immunoproteasomes as Therapeutic Targets for Chordoma.,"Chordomas account for approximately 1-4% of all malignant bone tumors and 20% of primary tumors of the spinal column. It is a rare disease, with an incidence estimated to be approximately 1 per 1,000,000 people. The underlying causative mechanism of chordoma is unknown, which makes it challenging to treat. Chordomas have been linked to the T-box transcription factor T (TBXT) gene located on chromosome 6. The TBXT gene encodes a protein transcription factor TBXT, or brachyury homolog. Currently, there is no approved targeted therapy for chordoma. Here, we performed a small molecule screening to identify small chemical molecules and therapeutic targets for treating chordoma. We screened 3730 unique compounds and selected 50 potential hits. The top three hits were Ribociclib, Ingenol-3-angelate, and Duvelisib. Among the top 10 hits, we found a novel class of small molecules, including proteasomal inhibitors, as promising molecules that reduce the proliferation of human chordoma cells. Furthermore, we discovered that proteasomal subunits PSMB5 and PSMB8 are increased in human chordoma cell lines U-CH1 and U-CH2, confirming that the proteasome may serve as a molecular target whose specific inhibition may lead to better therapeutic strategies for chordoma.",2023-04-18
37111617,Development of a Peptide-Based Nano-Sized Cathepsin B Inhibitor for Anticancer Therapy.,"Numerous cathepsin B inhibitors have been developed and are under investigation as potential cancer treatments. They have been evaluated for their ability to inhibit cathepsin B activity and reduce tumor growth. However, they have shown critical limitations, including low anticancer efficacy and high toxicity, due to their low selectivity and delivery problems. In this study, we developed a novel peptide and drug conjugate (PDC)-based cathepsin B inhibitor using cathepsin-B-specific peptide (RR) and bile acid (BA). Interestingly, this RR and BA conjugate (RR-BA) was able to self-assemble in an aqueous solution, and as a result, it formed stable nanoparticles. The nano-sized RR-BA conjugate showed significant cathepsin B inhibitory effects and anticancer effects against mouse colorectal cancer (CT26) cells. Its therapeutic effect and low toxicity were also confirmed in CT26 tumor-bearing mice after intravenous injection. Therefore, based on these results, the RR-BA conjugate could be developed as an effective anticancer drug candidate for inhibiting cathepsin B in anticancer therapy.",2023-04-03
37109708,The Use of PuraStat<sup>®</sup> in the Management of Walled-Off Pancreatic Necrosis Drained Using Lumen-Apposing Metal Stents: A Case Series.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Bleeding is one of the most feared and frequent adverse events in the case of EUS-guided drainage of WOPN using lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMSs) and of direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN). When it occurs, its management is still controversial. In the last few years, PuraStat, a novel hemostatic peptide gel has been introduced, expanding the toolbox of the endoscopic hemostatic agents. The aim of this case series was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PuraStat in preventing and controlling bleeding of WOPN drainage using LAMSs. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This is a multicenter, retrospective pilot study from three high-volume centers in Italy, including all consecutive patients treated with the novel hemostatic peptide gel after LAMSs placement for the drainage of symptomatic WOPN between 2019 and 2022. <i>Results</i>: A total of 10 patients were included. All patients underwent at least one session of DEN. Technical success of PuraStat was achieved in 100% of patients. In seven cases PuraStat was placed for post-DEN bleeding prevention, with one patient experiencing bleeding after DEN. In three cases, on the other hand, PuraStat was placed to manage active bleeding: two cases of oozing were successfully controlled with gel application, and a massive spurting from a retroperitoneal vessel required subsequent angiography. No re-bleeding occurred. No PuraStat-related adverse events were reported. <i>Conclusions</i>: This novel peptide gel could represent a promising hemostatic device, both in preventing and managing active bleeding after EUS-guided drainage of WON. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm its efficacy.",2023-04-12
37106272,"Elabela, a Novel Peptide, Exerts Neuroprotective Effects Against Ischemic Stroke Through the APJ/miR-124-3p/CTDSP1/AKT Pathway.","Elabela (ELA), which is the second endogenous peptide ligand of the apelin receptor (APJ) to be discovered, has been widely studied for potential use as a therapeutic peptide. However, its role in ischemic stroke (IS), which is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide and has limited therapeutic options, is uncertain. The aim of the present study was to investigate the beneficial effects of ELA on neuron survival after ischemia and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Primary cortical neurons were isolated from the cerebral cortex of pregnant C57BL/6J mice. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence showed that ELA inhibited oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) -induced apoptosis and axonal damage in vitro. Additionally, analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus database revealed that the expression of microRNA-124-3p (miR-124-3p) was decreased in blood samples from patients with IS, while the expression of C-terminal domain small phosphatase 1 (CTDSP1) was increased. These results indicated that miR-124-3p and CTDSP1 were related to ischemic stroke, and there might be a negative regulatory relationship between them. Then, we found that ELA significantly elevated miR-124-3p expression, suppressed CTDSP1 expression, and increased p-AKT expression by binding to the APJ receptor under OGD in vitro. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that CTDSP1 was a direct target of miR-124-3p. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of CTDSP1 exacerbated neuronal apoptosis and axonal damage and suppressed AKT phosphorylation, while treatment with ELA or miR-124-3p mimics reversed these effects. In conclusion, these results indicated that ELA could alleviate neuronal apoptosis and axonal damage by upregulating miR-124-3p and activating the CTDSP1/AKT signaling pathway. This study, for the first time, verified the protective effect of ELA against neuronal injury after ischemia and revealed the underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated the potential for the use of ELA as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of ischemic stroke.",2023-04-27
37103357,A Novel Aldisine Derivative Exhibits Potential Antitumor Effects by Targeting JAK/STAT3 Signaling.,"The JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway is aberrantly hyperactivated in many cancers, promoting cell proliferation, survival, invasiveness, and metastasis. Thus, inhibitors targeting JAK/STAT3 have enormous potential for cancer treatment. Herein, we modified <b>aldisine</b> derivatives by introducing the isothiouronium group, which can improve the antitumor activity of the compounds. We performed a high-throughput screen of 3157 compounds and identified compounds <b>11a</b>, <b>11b</b>, and <b>11c</b>, which contain a pyrrole [2,3-c] azepine structure linked to an isothiouronium group through different lengths of carbon alkyl chains and significantly inhibited JAK/STAT3 activities. Further results showed that compound <b>11c</b> exhibited the optimal antiproliferative activity and was a pan-JAKs inhibitor capable of inhibiting constitutive and IL-6-induced STAT3 activation. In addition, compound <b>11c</b> influenced STAT3 downstream gene expression (Bcl-xl, C-Myc, and Cyclin D1) and induced the apoptosis of A549 and DU145 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The antitumor effects of <b>11c</b> were further demonstrated in an in vivo subcutaneous tumor xenograft experiment with DU145 cells. Taken together, we designed and synthesized a novel small molecule JAKs inhibitor targeting the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, which has predicted therapeutic potential for JAK/STAT3 overactivated cancer treatment.",2023-03-29
37101592,Antithrombotic Effects of the Novel Small-Molecule Factor XIa Inhibitor Milvexian in a Rabbit Arteriovenous Shunt Model of Venous Thrombosis.,"<b>Background</b>  Factor XIa (FXIa) is an emerging therapeutic target, and FXIa inhibition is a promising mechanism to improve therapeutic index over current anticoagulants. Milvexian (BMS-986177/JNJ-70033093) is an oral small-molecule FXIa inhibitor. <b>Objective</b>  Milvexian's antithrombotic efficacy was characterized in a rabbit arteriovenous (AV) shunt model of venous thrombosis and compared with the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. <b>Methods</b>  The AV shunt model of thrombosis was conducted in anesthetized rabbits. Vehicle or drugs were administered as intravenous bolus plus a continuous infusion. Thrombus weight was the primary efficacy endpoint. Ex vivo activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and thrombin time (TT) were measured as the pharmacodynamic responses. <b>Results</b>  Milvexian dose dependently reduced thrombus weights by 34.3 ± 7.9, 51.6 ± 6.8 ( <i>p</i>  < 0.01; <i>n</i>  = 5), and 66.9 ± 4.8% ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001; <i>n</i>  = 6) versus vehicle at 0.25 + 0.17, 1.0 + 0.67, and 4.0 ± 2.68 mg/kg bolus + mg/kg/h infusion, respectively. Ex vivo clotting data supported a dose-dependent prolongation of aPTT (with 1.54-, 2.23-, and 3.12-fold increases from baseline upon the AV shunt start), but no changes in PT and TT. Dose-dependent inhibition in thrombus weight and clotting assays was also demonstrated for both apixaban and dabigatran as the references for the model validation. <b>Conclusion</b>  Results demonstrate that milvexian is an effective anticoagulant for prevention of venous thrombosis in the rabbit model, which supports the utility of milvexian in venous thrombosis, as seen in the phase 2 clinical study.",2023-04-24
37101053,Surufatinib-induced renal thrombotic microangiopathy: first case report and review of literature.,"Angiogenesis inhibitors such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are common therapeutics currently used to treat oncologic disease. Surufatinib is a novel, small-molecule multiple receptor TKI approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the treatment of progressive, advanced, and well-differentiated pancreatic and extrapancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a well-documented complication of TKIs targeting the VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signalling pathway. Here, we describe a 43-year-old female patient with biopsy-proven TMA and nephrotic syndrome due to surufatinib treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma. Histological lesions included glomerular endothelial swelling, widening of subendothelial spaces, mesangiolysis, and double contour, which caused nephrotic proteinuria. Effective management was achieved by drug withdrawal and oral anti-hypertensive regents. The management of surufatinib-related nephrotoxicity without compromising its anticancer effects is challenging. Hypertension and proteinuria must be closely monitored during drug use to reduce or stop the dose in a timely manner before severe nephrotoxicity occurs.",2023-04-26
37100478,Linking peptide-oriented surface imprinting magnetic nanoparticle with carbon nanotube-based fluorescence signal output device for ultrasensitive detection of glycoprotein.,"Determination of trace glycoprotein has important guiding significance in clinical diagnosis and is usually achieved by immunoaffinity. However, immunoaffinity possesses inherent drawbacks, such as poor probability of high-quality antibodies, instability of biological reagents, and harmfulness of chemical labels to the body. Herein, we propose an innovative method of peptide-oriented surface imprinting to fabricate artificial antibody for recognition of glycoprotein. By integrating peptide-oriented surface imprinting and PEGylation, an innovative hydrophilic peptide-oriented surface imprinting magnetic nanoparticle (HPIMN) was successfully fabricated with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) as a model glycoprotein template. In addition, we further prepared a novel boronic acid-modified/fluorescein isothiocyanate-loaded/polyethylene glycol-covered carbon nanotube (BFPCN) as fluorescence signal output device, which was loaded with numerous fluorescent molecules could specifically label the cis-diol of glycoprotein at physiological pH via boronate-affinity interaction. To prove the practicability, we proposed a HPIMN-BFPCN strategy, in which the HPIMN first selectively captured the HER2 due to the molecular imprinted recognition and then the BFPCN specific labeled the exposed cis-diol of HER2 based on the boronate-affinity reaction. The HPIMN-BFPCN strategy exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity with limit of detection of 14 fg mL<sup>-1</sup> and was successfully used in the determination of HER2 in spiked sample with recovery and relative standard deviation in the range of 99.0%-103.0% and 3.1%-5.6%, respectively. Therefore, we believe that the novel peptide-oriented surface imprinting has great potential to become an universal strategy for fabrication of recognition units for other protein biomarkers, and the synergy sandwich assay could become a powerful tool in prognosis evaluation and clinical diagnosis of glycoprotein-related diseases.",2023-04-08
37092472,Protein Delivery to Insect Epithelial Cells In Vivo: Potential Application to Functional Molecular Analysis of Proteins in Butterfly Wing Development.,"Protein delivery to cells in vivo has great potential for the functional analysis of proteins in nonmodel organisms. In this study, using the butterfly wing system, we investigated a method of protein delivery to insect epithelial cells that allows for easy access, treatment, and observation in real time in vivo. Topical and systemic applications (called the sandwich and injection methods, respectively) were tested. In both methods, green/orange fluorescent proteins (GFP/OFP) were naturally incorporated into intracellular vesicles and occasionally into the cytosol from the apical surface without any delivery reagent. However, the antibodies were not delivered by the sandwich method at all, and were delivered only into vesicles by the injection method. A membrane-lytic peptide, L17E, appeared to slightly improve the delivery of GFP/OFP and antibodies. A novel peptide reagent, ProteoCarry, successfully promoted the delivery of both GFP/OFP and antibodies into the cytosol via both the sandwich and injection methods. These protein delivery results will provide opportunities for the functional molecular analysis of proteins in butterfly wing development, and may offer a new way to deliver proteins into target cells in vivo in nonmodel organisms.",2023-04-16
37067993,"TACH101, a first-in-class pan-inhibitor of KDM4 histone demethylase.","Histone lysine demethylase 4 (KDM4) is an epigenetic regulator that facilitates the transition between transcriptionally silent and active chromatin states by catalyzing the removal of methyl groups on histones H3K9, H3K36, and H1.4K26. KDM4 overamplification or dysregulation has been reported in various cancers and has been shown to drive key processes linked to tumorigenesis, such as replicative immortality, evasion of apoptosis, metastasis, DNA repair deficiency, and genomic instability. KDM4 also plays a role in epigenetic regulation of cancer stem cell renewal and has been linked to more aggressive disease and poorer clinical outcomes. The KDM4 family is composed of four main isoforms (KDM4A-D) that demonstrate functional redundancy and cross-activity; thus, selective inhibition of one isoform appears to be ineffective and pan-inhibition targeting multiple KDM4 isoforms is required. Here, we describe TACH101, a novel, small-molecule pan-inhibitor of KDM4 that selectively targets KDM4A-D with no effect on other KDM families. TACH101 demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity in cancer cell lines and organoid models derived from various histologies, including colorectal, esophageal, gastric, breast, pancreatic, and hematological malignancies. In vivo , potent inhibition of KDM4 led to efficient tumor growth inhibition and regression in several xenograft models. A reduction in the population of tumor-initiating cells was observed following TACH101 treatment. Overall, these observations demonstrate the broad applicability of TACH101 as a potential anticancer agent and support its advancement into clinical trials.",2023-03-24
37057133,"Synthesis, radiolabeling, and evaluation of a (4-quinolinoyl)glycyl-2-cyanopyrrolidine analogue for fibroblast activation protein (FAP) PET imaging.","Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is regarded as a promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors as it was overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts. FAP inhibitors bearing a quinoline scaffold have been proven to show high affinity against FAP <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and the scaffold has been radio-labeled for the imaging and treatment of FAP-positive tumors. However, currently available FAP imaging agents both contain chelator groups to enable radio-metal labeling, making those tracers more hydrophilic and not suitable for the imaging of lesions in the brain. Herein, we report the synthesis, radio-labeling, and evaluation of a <sup>18</sup>F-labeled quinoline analogue ([<sup>18</sup>F]<b>3</b>) as a potential FAP-targeted PET tracer, which holds the potential to be blood-brain barrier-permeable. [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>3</b> was obtained by one-step radio-synthesis <i>via</i> a copper-mediated S<sub>N</sub>A<sub>R</sub> reaction from a corresponding boronic ester precursor. [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>3</b> showed moderate lipophilicity with a log <i>D</i> <sub><i>7.4</i></sub> value of 1.11. In cell experiments, [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>3</b> showed selective accumulation in A549-FAP and U87 cell lines and can be effectively blocked by the pre-treatment of a cold reference standard. Biodistribution studies indicated that [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>3</b> was mainly excreted by hepatic clearance and urinary excretion, and it may be due to its moderate lipophilicity. <i>In vivo</i> PET imaging studies indicated [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>3</b> showed selective accumulation in FAP-positive tumors, and specific binding was confirmed by blocking studies. However, low brain uptake was observed in biodistribution and PET imaging studies. Although our preliminary data indicated that [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>3</b> holds the potential to be developed as a blood-brain barrier penetrable FAP-targeted PET tracer, its low brain uptake limits its application in the detection of brain lesions. Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>3</b> as a novel small-molecule FAPI-targeted PET tracer, and our results suggest further structural optimizations would be needed to develop a BBB-permeable PET tracer with this scaffold.",2023-03-28
37052498,"CDBN-YGXZ, a Novel Small-Molecule Drug, Shows Efficacy against Clostridioides difficile Infection and Recurrence in Mouse and Hamster Infection Models.","Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) causes severe diarrhea and colitis, leading to significant morbidity, mortality, and high medical costs worldwide. Oral vancomycin, a first-line treatment for CDI, is associated with a high risk of recurrence, necessitating novel therapies for primary and recurrent CDI. A novel small-molecule compound, CDBN-YGXZ, was synthesized by modifying the benzene ring of nitazoxanide with lauric acid. The mechanism of action of CDBN-YGXZ was validated using a pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) inhibition assay. The efficacy of CDBN-YGXZ was evaluated using the MIC test and CDI infection model in mice and hamsters. Furthermore, metagenomics was used to reveal the underlying reasons for the effective reduction or prevention of CDI after CDBN-YGXZ treatment. The inhibitory activity against PFOR induced by CDBN-YGXZ. MIC tests showed that the <i>in vitro</i> activity of CDBN-YGXZ against C. difficile ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 μg/mL. In the mouse and hamster CDI models, CDBN-YGXZ provided protection during both treatment and relapse, while vancomycin treatment resulted in severe relapse and significant clinical scores. Compared with global effects on the indigenous gut microbiota induced by vancomycin, CDBN-YGXZ treatment had a mild influence on gut microbes, thus resulting in the disappearance or reduction of CDI recurrence. CDBN-YGXZ displayed potent activity against C. difficile <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, reducing or preventing relapse in infected animals, which could merit further development as a potential drug candidate for treating CDI.",2023-04-13
37044298,A novel peptide isolated from Aphonopelma chalcodes tarantula venom with benefits on pancreatic islet function and appetite control.,"Proof-of-concept for therapeutic application of venom-derived compounds in diabetes is exemplified by the incretin mimetic, exenatide, originally extracted from the saliva of the venomous Heloderma suspectum lizard. In this regard, we have isolated and sequenced a novel 28 amino acid peptide named Δ-theraphotoxin-Ac1 (Δ-TRTX-AC1) from venom of the Mexican Blond tarantula spider Aphonopelma chalcodes, with potential therapeutic benefits for diabetes. Following confirmation of the structure and safety profile of the synthetic peptide, assessment of enzymatic stability and effects of Δ-TRTX-AC1 on in vitro beta-cell function were studied, alongside potential mechanisms. Glucose homeostatic and satiety actions of Δ-TRTX-AC1 alone, and in combination with exenatide, were then assessed in C57BL/6 mice. Synthetic Δ-TRTX-AC1 was shown to adopt a characteristic inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK)-like structure and was non-toxic to beta-cells. Δ-TRTX-AC1 evoked glucose-dependent insulin secretion from BRIN BD11 cells with bioactivity confirmed in murine islets. Insulin secretory potency was established to be dependent on K<sub>ATP</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel beta-cell signalling. In addition, Δ-TRTX-AC1 enhanced beta-cell proliferation and provided significant protection against cytokine-induced apoptosis. When injected co-jointly with glucose in mice at a dose of 250 nmol/kg, Δ-TRTX-AC1 decreased blood-glucose levels and evoked a significant satiating effect. Moreover, whilst Δ-TRTX-AC1 did not enhance exenatide induced benefits on glucose homeostasis, the peptide significantly augmented exenatide mediated suppression of appetite. Together these data highlight the therapeutic potential of tarantula spider venom-derived peptides, such as Δ-TRTX-Ac1, for diabetes and related obesity.",2023-04-11
37044149,A novel small molecule AdipoR2 agonist ameliorates experimental hepatic steatosis in hamsters and mice.,"Adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) can be activated by its endogenous ligand adiponectin to reduce hepatic steatosis, and is regarded as a therapeutic target for metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). This study proposes a novel anthraquinone compound, emodin succinate monoethyl ester (ESME), which activates AdipoR2, inhibits hepatic lipogenesis, promotes fatty acid oxidation, and alleviates experimental hepatic steatosis in hamsters and mice. Molecular docking shows that ESME has strong binding potential with AdipoR2 by forming a arene-arene interaction. AdipoR2 on the cytomembrane of HepG2 cells can be labeled by fluorescent ESME (Cy5-ESME). ESME activates AdipoR2, AMPK and PPARα, and reduces lipid deposition in palmitic acid or oleic acid-induced HepG2 and L02 cells. Suppression of AdipoR2 expression or AMPK activation completely eliminates the effect of ESME on reducing lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Oral administration of ESME reduces liver lipid production and accumulation, and alleviates hepatic steatosis in hamsters and Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> mice induced by high-fat diet. Compared with statins and emodin, ESME showed prepotent efficacy and safety in reducing hepatic steatosis and protecting hepatocytes. Furthermore, ESME activates CaMKK2 and LKB1 in liver to activate AMPK and reduce lipogenesis through stimulating AdipoR2. Taken together, ESME reduces hepatic lipid accumulation and alleviates hepatic steatosis by agonizing AdipoR2. ESME is a promising new agent for clinical treatment of MAFLD.",2023-04-10
37039433,Identification of a Novel Small Molecule That Enhances the Release of Extracellular Vesicles with Immunostimulatory Potency via Induction of Calcium Influx.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) transfer antigens and immunomodulatory molecules in immunologic synapses as a part of intracellular communication, and EVs equipped with immunostimulatory functions have been utilized for vaccine formulation. Hence, we sought small-molecule compounds that increase immunostimulatory EVs released by antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) for enhancement of vaccine immunogenicity. We previously performed high-throughput screening on a 28K compound library using three THP-1 reporter cell lines with CD63 Turbo-Luciferase, NF-κB, and interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE) reporter constructs, respectively. Because intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation enhances EV release, we screened 80 hit compounds and identified compound <b>634</b> as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx inducer. <b>634</b> enhanced EV release in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (mBMDCs) and increased costimulatory molecule expression on the surface of EVs and the parent cells. EVs isolated from <b>634</b>-treated mBMDCs induced T cell proliferation in the presence of antigenic peptides. To assess the roles of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in immunostimulatory EV release, we performed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of <b>634</b>. The analogues that retained the ability to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced more EVs with immunostimulatory properties from mBMDCs than did those that lacked the ability to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> induction of synthesized analogues correlated with the numbers of EVs released and costimulatory molecule expression on the parent cells. Collectively, our study presents that a small molecule, <b>634</b>, enhances the release of EVs with immunostimulatory potency via induction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. This agent is a novel tool for EV-based immune studies and vaccine development.",2023-04-11

37037098,A novel S2-derived peptide-based ELISA for broad detection of antibody against infectious bronchitis virus.,"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Vaccination is an effective approach for controlling IBV. Therefore, reliable immune monitoring for IB is critical for poultry. In this study, a novel peptide derived from S2 protein was used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against IBV. The peptide-based ELISA (pELISA) showed good specificity and sensitivity in detecting IBV antibodies against different serotypes. A semilogarithmic regression method for determining IBV antibody titers was also established. Antibody titers detected by pELISA and calculated with this equation were statistically similar to those evaluated by indirect fluorescence assay (IFA). Moreover, the comparison analysis showed a 96.07% compatibility between the pELISA and IDEXX ELISA. All these data demonstrate that the pELISA generated here can be as a rapid and reliable serological surveillance tool for monitoring IBV infection or vaccination.",2023-03-17
37036170,Plant defensin MtDef4-derived antifungal peptide with multiple modes of action and potential as a bio-inspired fungicide.,"Chemical fungicides have been instrumental in protecting crops from fungal diseases. However, increasing fungal resistance to many of the single-site chemical fungicides calls for the development of new antifungal agents with novel modes of action (MoA). The sequence-divergent cysteine-rich antifungal defensins with multisite MoA are promising starting templates for design of novel peptide-based fungicides. Here, we experimentally tested such a set of 17-amino-acid peptides containing the γ-core motif of the antifungal plant defensin MtDef4. These designed peptides exhibited antifungal properties different from those of MtDef4. Focused analysis of a lead peptide, GMA4CG_V6, showed that it was a random coil in solution with little or no secondary structure elements. Additionally, it exhibited potent cation-tolerant antifungal activity against the plant fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent of grey mould disease in fruits and vegetables. Its multisite MoA involved localization predominantly to the plasma membrane, permeabilization of the plasma membrane, rapid internalization into the vacuole and cytoplasm, and affinity for the bioactive phosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), PI4P, and PI5P. The sequence motif RRRW was identified as a major determinant of the antifungal activity of this peptide. While topical spray application of GMA4CG_V6 on Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato plants provided preventive and curative suppression of grey mould disease symptoms, the peptide was not internalized into plant cells. Our findings open the possibility that truncated and modified defensin-derived peptides containing the γ-core sequence could serve as promising candidates for further development of bio-inspired fungicides.",2023-04-10
37032813,Evolutionary and <i>in silico</i> guided development of novel peptide analogues for antibacterial activity against ESKAPE pathogens.,"According to WHO, to combat the resistant strains, new effective anti-microbial agents are needed on an urgent basis and global researchers should focus their efforts and discovery programs on developing them against antibiotic-resistant pathogens or priority pathogens like ESKAPE. In this context, Cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are being explored extensively as promising next-generation antimicrobials due to their broad range, fast kinetics and multifunctional role. Despite recent advances, it is still a daunting challenge to identify and design a potent AMP with no cytotoxicity, but with broad specific antimicrobial activity, stability and efficacy under <i>in vivo</i> conditions in a cost-effective and robust manner. In this work, as a proof of concept, we designed novel potent AMPs using artificial intelligence based <i>in silico</i> programs. Shortlisted peptide sequences were synthesized using the fmoc chemistry approach, assessed their antimicrobial activity, cell selectivity, mode of action and <i>in vivo</i> efficacy using a series of experiments. The synthesized peptide analogues demonstrated their antimicrobial activity (MIC in the range of 2.5-80 μM) against bacteria. The identified potential lead molecules showed antibacterial activity in physiological conditions with no signs of cytotoxicity. We further tested the antimicrobial activity of peptide analogues for treating wounds infected with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> in the mice burn wound model. In drug-development programs, the identification of lead antimicrobial agents is always challenging and involves screening a large number of molecules which is time-consuming and expensive. This work demonstrates the utility of artificial intelligence based <i>in silico</i> analysis programs in discovering novel antimicrobial agents in an economical, robust way.",2023-03-17
37030504,A novel machine learning-based screening identifies statins as inhibitors of the calcium pump SERCA.,"We report a novel small-molecule screening approach that combines data augmentation and machine learning to identify Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs interacting with the calcium pump (Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, SERCA) from skeletal (SERCA1a) and cardiac (SERCA2a) muscle. This approach uses information about small-molecule effectors to map and probe the chemical space of pharmacological targets, thus allowing to screen with high precision large databases of small molecules, including approved and investigational drugs. We chose SERCA because it plays a major role in the excitation-contraction-relaxation cycle in muscle and it represents a major target in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. The machine learning model predicted that SERCA1a and SERCA2a are pharmacological targets for seven statins, a group of FDA-approved 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors used in the clinic as lipid-lowering medications. We validated the machine learning predictions by using in vitro ATPase assays to show that several FDA-approved statins are partial inhibitors of SERCA1a and SERCA2a. Complementary atomistic simulations predict that these drugs bind to two different allosteric sites of the pump. Our findings suggest that SERCA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport may be targeted by some statins (e.g., atorvastatin), thus providing a molecular pathway to explain statin-associated toxicity reported in the literature. These studies show the applicability of data augmentation and machine learning-based screening as a general platform for the identification of off-target interactions and the applicability of this approach extends to drug discovery.",2023-04-06
37029768,Fragment-based investigation of thiourea derivatives as VEGFR-2 inhibitors: a cross-validated approach of ligand-based and structure-based molecular modeling studies.,"Angiogenesis is mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that plays a key role in the modulation of progression, invasion and metastasis, related to solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Several small-molecule VEGFR-2 inhibitors are marketed, but their usage is restricted to specific cancers due to severe toxicities. Therefore, cost-effective novel small molecule VEGFR-2 inhibitors may be an alternative to overcome these adverse effects. Here, a set of thiourea-based VEGFR-2 inhibitors were considered for a combined fragment-based QSAR technique, structure-based molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics simulation studies to acquire insights into the key structural attributes and the binding pattern of enzyme-ligand interactions. Noticeably, amine-substituted quinazoline phenyl ring and a higher number of nitrogen atoms, and the hydrazide function in the molecular structure are crucial for VEGFR-2 inhibition whereas methoxy groups are detrimental to VEGFR-2 inhibition. The MD simulation study of sorafenib and thiourea derivatives explored the significance of urea and thiourea moiety binding at VEGFR-2 active site that can be utilized further in the future to design molecules for greater binding stability and better VEGFR-2 selectivity. Therefore, such findings can be beneficial for the development of newer VEGFR-2 inhibitors for further refinement to acquire better therapeutic efficacy.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

37026514,Overexpression of salusin‑α upregulates AdipoR2 and activates the PPARα/ApoA5/SREBP‑1c pathway to inhibit lipid synthesis in HepG2 cells.,"Salusin‑α and adiponectin, are vasoactive peptides with numerous similar biological effects related to lipid metabolism. Adiponectin has been shown to reduce fatty acid oxidation and to inhibit lipid synthesis of liver cells through its receptor, adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2), but whether salusin‑α is able to interact with AdipoR2, was not previously reported. To investigate this, <i>in vitro</i> experiments were carried out. The overexpression and interference recombinant plasmids were constructed with salusin‑α. The lentiviral expression systems of salusin‑α overexpression and interference were respectively synthesized in 293T cells, and 293T cells were infected with the lentivirus. Finally, the association between salusin‑α and AdipoR2 was analyzed by semi‑quantitative PCR. Subsequently, HepG2 cells were also infected with these viruses. The expression levels of AdipoR2, peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑α (PPARα), apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5) and sterol regulatory element‑binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP‑1c) were detected by western blotting, and AdipoR2 inhibitor (thapsigargin) and agonist [4‑phenyl butyric acid (PBA)] were used to observe the resultant changes in the aforementioned molecules. The results obtained revealed that the overexpression of salusin‑α increased the level of AdipoR2 in 293T and HepG2 cells, led to an upregulation of the levels of PPARα and ApoA5, and inhibited the expression of SREBP‑1c, whereas the salusin‑α interference lentivirus exerted the opposite effects. Notably, thapsigargin inhibited the expression of AdipoR2, PPARα and ApoA5 in HepG2 cells of pHAGE‑Salusin‑α group, and caused an increase in the level of SREBP‑1c, whereas the opposite effects were observed in pLKO.1‑shSalusin‑α#1 group upon treatment with PBA. Taken together, these data demonstrated that overexpression of salusin‑α upregulated AdipoR2, which in turn activated the PPARα/ApoA5/SREBP‑1c signaling pathway to inhibit lipid synthesis in HepG2 cells, thereby providing theoretical data on which to base the clinical application of salusin‑α as a novel peptide for molecular intervention in fatty liver disease.",2023-04-07
37016815,Thyrotropin Receptor Antagonism by a Novel Small Molecule: Preclinical <i>In Vitro</i> Observations.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism (GH) and Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is far from adequate, and hence, new substances that specifically target the autoantigens in GH/GO are warranted. This study determined the preclinical <i>in vitro</i> efficacy of SYD5115, a novel low-molecular-weight compound that inhibits the thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The TSH-R inhibiting capability of SYD5115 was tested through stimulation of wild-type and chimeric TSH-R expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using two functional (stimulatory and blocking) cell-based TSH-R-Ab bioassays. TSH-R expressing human orbital fibroblasts, collected from GH+GO patients (GOF), were stimulated with the monoclonal antibody M22 or with stimulatory TSH-R-Ab (TSAb)-positive sera with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or hyaluronic acid (HA) release as readouts. The effect of SYD5115 on the viability of GOF was tested in 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and scratch cell growth assays. <b><i>Results:</i></b> SYD5115 significantly and dose dependently inhibited the TSH-R activation through M22 or TSAb-positive sera in all performed bioassays. Inhibition showed similar levels in the TSAb reporter bioassay and in the cAMP assay with GOF. The % inhibition and compound concentration showed a sigmoidal relationship, with all seven TSAb-positive sera markedly inhibited by SYD5115. An SYD5115 dose-dependent inhibition of M22 (10 ng/mL, 6 hours)-stimulated HA and/or cAMP-release from GOF was observed. Strong SYD5115-induced inhibitions of M22-stimulated cAMP production in GOF were registered with SYD5115 concentrations of 1 (<i>p</i> = 0.0029), 10 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), 100 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), 1,000 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and 10,000 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) nM, respectively. SYD5115-induced inhibition of M22-stimulated HA production was noted with SYD5115 concentrations of 100 (<i>p</i> = 0.0392), 1000 (<i>p</i> = 0.0431), and 10,000 (<i>p</i> = 0.0245) nM, respectively. The inhibitory activity of SYD5115 was confirmed in a human osteosarcoma U2OS cell line stably expressing human TSH-R with cAMP as readout. SYD5115 induced 100% inhibition of the M22-induced cAMP levels with a potency of 193 nM. Compared with control, SYD5115 did neither impact the growth nor the migration of cultivated GOF. In addition, SYD5115 did not alter the viability of GOF. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> SYD5115 blocked M22- and TSAb-induced TSH-R activity with a nanomolar potency in TSH-R-overexpressed CHO cells as well as primary GOF, which demonstrates the ability of this small molecule to block TSH-R overactivity.",2023-05-08

37010994,Identification of novel peptide inhibitors for oncogenic KRAS G12D as therapeutic options using mutagenesis-based remodeling and MD simulations.,"The Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) serves as a molecular switch, cycling between guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound and inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound states. KRAS modulates numerous signal transduction pathways including the conventional RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. Mutations in the RAS genes have been linked to the formation of malignant tumors. Human malignancies typically show mutations in the Ras gene including HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS. Among all the mutations in exon 12 and exon 13 of the KRAS gene, the G12D mutation is more prevalent in pancreatic and lung cancer and accounts for around 41% of all G12 mutations, making them potential anticancer therapeutic targets. The present study is aimed at repurposing the peptide inhibitor KD2 of the KRAS G12D mutant. We employed an <i>in-silico</i> mutagenesis approach to design novel peptide inhibitors from the experimentally reported peptide inhibitor, and it was found that substitutions (N8W, N8I, and N8Y) might enhance the peptide's binding affinity toward the KRAS. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding energy calculations confirmed that the newly designed peptide inhibitors are stable and that their binding affinities are stronger as compared to the wild-type peptide. The detailed analysis revealed that newly designed peptides have the potential to inhibit KRAS/Raf interaction and the oncogenic signal of the KRAS G12D mutant. Our findings strongly suggest that these peptides should be tested and clinically validated to combat the oncogenic activity of KRAS.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",2023-04-03
37008784,"1400 W, a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, mitigates early neuroinflammation and nitrooxidative stress in diisopropylfluorophosphate-induced short-term neurotoxicity rat model.","Organophosphate nerve agent (OPNA) exposure induces acute and long-term neurological deficits. OPNA exposure at sub-lethal concentrations induces irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and cholinergic toxidrome and develops <i>status epilepticus</i> (SE). Persistent seizures have been associated with increased production of ROS/RNS, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. A total of 1400W is a novel small molecule, which irreversibly inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and has been shown to effectively reduce ROS/RNS generation. In this study, we investigated the effects of 1400W treatment for a week or two weeks at 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg per day in the rat diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) model. 1400W significantly reduced the number of microglia, astroglia, and NeuN+FJB positive cells compared to the vehicle in different regions of the brain. 1400W also significantly reduced nitrooxidative stress markers and proinflammatory cytokines in the serum. However, neither of the two concentrations of 1400W for two weeks of treatment had any significant effect on epileptiform spike rate and spontaneous seizures during the treatment period in mixed sex cohorts, males, or females. No significant sex differences were found in response to DFP exposure or 1400W treatment. In conclusion, 1400W treatment at 15 mg/kg per day for two weeks was more effective in significantly reducing DFP-induced nitrooxidative stress, neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative changes.",2023-03-17
37001244,"Discovery of SYD5115, a novel orally active small molecule TSH-R antagonist.","The thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) regulates the thyroid gland and is normally activated by thyrotropin. In patients with Graves' disease, TSH-R is also stimulated by stimulatory TSH-R autoantibodies leading to hyperthyroidism. In this paper, we describe the discovery of SYD5115 (67), a novel small molecule TSH-R antagonist with nanomolar potency. SYD5115 also blocks stimulating antibody induced synthesis of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) in vivo, after a single oral dose. During optimization, several issues had to be addressed such as the low metabolic stability and the potential mutagenicity of our first series of compounds.",2023-03-23
36977373,"Analysis of the Proteomic Profile in Serum of Irradiated Nonhuman Primates Treated with Ex-Rad, a Radiation Medical Countermeasure.","There are currently four radiation medical countermeasures that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to mitigate hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome, all of which are repurposed radiomitigators. The evaluation of additional candidate drugs that may also be helpful for use during a radiological/nuclear emergency is ongoing. A chlorobenzyl sulfone derivative (organosulfur compound) known as Ex-Rad, or ON01210, is one such candidate medical countermeasure, being a novel, small-molecule kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in the murine model. In this study, nonhuman primates exposed to ionizing radiation were subsequently administered Ex-Rad as two treatment schedules (Ex-Rad I administered 24 and 36 h post-irradiation, and Ex-Rad II administered 48 and 60 h post-irradiation) and the proteomic profiles of serum using a global molecular profiling approach were assessed. We observed that administration of Ex-Rad post-irradiation is capable of mitigating radiation-induced perturbations in protein abundance, particularly in restoring protein homeostasis, immune response, and mitigating hematopoietic damage, at least in part after acute exposure. Taken together, restoration of functionally significant pathway perturbations may serve to protect damage to vital organs and provide long-term survival benefits to the afflicted population.",2023-03-28
36971365,Perspective for Discovery of Small Molecule IL-6 Inhibitors through Study of Structure-Activity Relationships and Molecular Docking.,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis and physiology of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as coronary heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and most recently COVID-19. IL-6 and its signaling pathway are promising targets in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Although, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies are currently being used in clinics, huge unmet medical needs remain because of the high cost, administration-related toxicity, lack of opportunity for oral dosing, and potential immunogenicity of monoclonal antibody therapy. Furthermore, nonresponse or loss of response to monoclonal antibody therapy has been reported, which increases the importance of optimizing drug therapy with small molecule drugs. This work aims to provide a perspective for the discovery of novel small molecule IL-6 inhibitors by the analysis of the structure-activity relationships and computational studies for protein-protein inhibitors targeting the IL-6/IL-6 receptor/gp130 complex.",2023-03-27
36927289,Structure-based small inhibitors search combined with molecular dynamics driven energies for human programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) protein.,"Human immune system is specialized in distinguishing normal cells from foreign particles mainly through proteins expressed on immune cells called 'checkpoints'. Immune checkpoints work as a switch to activate and deactivate immune responses. T cells express one of the immune checkpoint, human programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), which normally operates as an off-switch function to protect the normal cell from T-cell attack. Binding of PD-1 to its ligand, the programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1/2) expressed on myeloid/cancer cells, induce downstream inhibitory signals, leading to tumor immune evasion. Targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 can boost the immune response against cancer cells. To design novel small molecule inhibitors for the PD-1, <i>in silico</i> structure-based screening on pharmacophoric points and molecular docking were performed. Based on the docking score and significant binding interaction with the crucial residues of PD-1 (Thr59, Glu61, Ser62, Glu84, Arg86 and Ala132), compounds were selected from the ZINC20 database, and their dynamic behavior and conformational stability were examined through molecular dynamic simulations. Besides, the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) method was used to calculate the binding strength of each selected inhibitor complexed with PD-1. The binding energy calculations revealed that these selected inhibitors show a considerable affinity for PD-1. The selected novel inhibitors exhibit excellent drug-like and pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity). In conclusion, the identified novel compounds (ZINC1443480030, ZINC1002854123, ZINC988238128, ZINC1481242350, ZINC1001739421, ZINC1220816434 and ZINC1167786692) from the current study can be validated <i>in-vitro</i> as potential PD-1 inhibitors and for discovery of novel drugs against PD-1 in the future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

36907567,The remarkably enzyme-rich venom of the Big Bend Scorpion (Diplocentrus whitei).,"Scorpion venoms have long been studied for their peptide discovery potential, with modern high-throughput venom-characterization techniques paving the way for the discovery of thousands of novel putative toxins. Research into these toxins has provided insight into the pathology and treatment of human diseases, even resulting in the development of one compound with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Although most of this research has focused on the toxins of scorpion species considered medically significant to humans, the venom of harmless scorpion species possess toxins that are homologous to those from medically significant species, indicating that harmless scorpion venoms may also serve as valuable sources of novel peptide variants. Furthermore, as harmless scorpions represent a vast majority of scorpion species diversity, and therefore venom toxin diversity, venoms from these species likely contain entirely new toxin classes. We sequenced the venom-gland transcriptome and venom proteome of two male Big Bend scorpions (Diplocentrus whitei), providing the first high-throughput venom characterization for a member of this genus. We identified a total of 82 toxins in the venom of D. whitei, 25 of which were identified in both the transcriptome and proteome, and 57 of which were only identified in the transcriptome. Furthermore, we identified a unique, enzyme-rich venom dominated by serine proteases and the first arylsulfatase B toxins identified in scorpions.",2023-03-11

36891498,Identification of a novel small-molecule inhibitor of miR-29b attenuates muscle atrophy.,"Muscle atrophy is debilitating and can be induced by several stressors. Unfortunately, there are no effective pharmacological treatment until now. MicroRNA (miR)-29b is an important target that we identified to be commonly involved in multiple types of muscle atrophy. Although sequence-specific inhibition of miR-29b has been developed, in this study, we report a novel small-molecule miR-29b inhibitor that targets miR-29b hairpin precursor (pre-miR-29b) (Targapremir-29b-066 [TGP-29b-066]) considering both its three-dimensional structure and the thermodynamics of interaction between pre-miR-29b and the small molecule. This novel small-molecule inhibitor has been demonstrated to attenuate muscle atrophy induced by angiotensin II (Ang II), dexamethasone (Dex), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in C2C12 myotubes, as evidenced by increase in the diameter of myotube and decrease in the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1. Moreover, it can also attenuate Ang II-induced muscle atrophy in mice, as evidenced by a similar increase in the diameter of myotube, reduced Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 expression, AKT-FOXO3A-mTOR signaling activation, and decreased apoptosis and autophagy. In summary, we experimentally identified and demonstrated a novel small-molecule inhibitor of miR-29b that could act as a potential therapeutic agent for muscle atrophy.",2023-02-04
36851795,Search of Novel Small Molecule Inhibitors for the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2.,"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has prompted the necessity of efficient treatment strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Main protease (Mpro), also called 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL protease), plays an essential role in cleaving virus polyproteins for the functional replication complex. Therefore, Mpro is a promising drug target for COVID-19 therapy. Through molecular modelling, docking and a protease activity assay, we found four novel inhibitors targeting Mpro with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and their binding affinities shown by the dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>s). Our new inhibitors CB-21, CB-25, CP-1 and LC24-20 have IC50s at 14.88 µM (95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 10.35 µM to 20.48 µM), 22.74 µM (95% CI: 13.01 µM to 38.16 µM), 18.54µM (95% CI: 6.54 µM to 36.30 µM) and 32.87µM (95% CI: 18.37 µM to 54.80 µM)), respectively. The evaluation of interactions suggested that each inhibitor has a hydrogen bond or hydrophobic interactions with important residues, including the most essential catalytic residues: His<sup>41</sup> and Cys<sup>145</sup>. All the four inhibitors have a much higher 50% lethal dose (LD50) compared with the well-known Mpro inhibitor GC376, demonstrating its low toxicity. These four inhibitors can be potential drug candidates for further in vitro and in vivo studies against COVID-19.",2023-02-20
36849761,Inhibition mechanism of MRTX1133 on KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>: a molecular dynamics simulation and Markov state model study.,"The mutant KRAS was considered as an ""undruggable"" target for decades, especially KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>. It is a great challenge to develop the inhibitors for KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> which lacks the thiol group for covalently binding ligands. The discovery of MRTX1133 solved the dilemma. Interestingly, MRTX1133 can bind to both the inactive and active states of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>. The binding mechanism of MRTX1133 with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, especially how MRTX1133 could bind the active state KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> without triggering the active function of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup><sub>,</sub> has not been fully understood. Here, we used a combination of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state model (MSM) to understand the inhibition mechanism of MRTX1133 and its analogs. The stationary probabilities derived from MSM show that MRTX1133 and its analogs can stabilize the inactive or active states of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> into different conformations. More remarkably, by scrutinizing the conformational differences, MRTX1133 and its analogs were hydrogen bonded to Gly60 to stabilize the switch II region and left switch I region in a dynamically inactive conformation, thus achieving an inhibitory effect. Our simulation and analysis provide detailed inhibition mechanism of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> induced by MRTX1133 and its analogs. This study will provide guidance for future design of novel small molecule inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>.",2023-02-28
36839992,Elastin-Derived VGVAPG Fragment Decorated Cell-Penetrating Peptide with Improved Gene Delivery Efficacy.,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are attractive non-viral gene delivery vectors due to their high transfection capacity and safety. Previously, we have shown that cell-penetrating peptide RALA can be a promising gene delivery vector for chronic wound regeneration application. In this study, we engineered a novel peptide called RALA-E by introducing elastin-derived VGVAPG fragment into RALA, in order to target the elastin-binding protein on the cell surface and thus improve delivery efficacy of RALA. The transfection efficiency of RALA-E was evaluated by transfecting the HEK-293T and HeLa cell lines cells with RALA-E/pDNA complexes and the flow-cytometry results showed that RALA-E significantly increased the transfection efficiency by nearly 20% in both cell lines compared to RALA. Inhibition of pDNA transfection on HEK-293T cells via chlorpromazine, genistein and mβCD showed that the inhibition extent in transfection efficiency was much less for RALA-E group compared to RALA group. In addition, RALA-E/miR-146a complexes showed up to 90% uptake efficiency in macrophages, and can escape from the endosome and enter the nucleus to inhibit the expression of inflammation genes. Therefore, the developed RALA-E peptide has high potential as a safe and efficient vector for gene therapy application.",2023-02-16
36839922,"A Review of Protein- and Peptide-Based Chemical Conjugates: Past, Present, and Future.","Over the past few decades, the complexity of molecular entities being advanced for therapeutic purposes has continued to evolve. A main propellent fueling innovation is the perpetual mandate within the pharmaceutical industry to meet the needs of novel disease areas and/or delivery challenges. As new mechanisms of action are uncovered, and as our understanding of existing mechanisms grows, the properties that are required and/or leveraged to enable therapeutic development continue to expand. One rapidly evolving area of interest is that of chemically enhanced peptide and protein therapeutics. While a variety of conjugate molecules such as antibody-drug conjugates, peptide/protein-PEG conjugates, and protein conjugate vaccines are already well established, others, such as antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates and peptide/protein conjugates using non-PEG polymers, are newer to clinical development. This review will evaluate the current development landscape of protein-based chemical conjugates with special attention to considerations such as modulation of pharmacokinetics, safety/tolerability, and entry into difficult to access targets, as well as bioavailability. Furthermore, for the purpose of this review, the types of molecules discussed are divided into two categories: (1) therapeutics that are enhanced by protein or peptide bioconjugation, and (2) protein and peptide therapeutics that require chemical modifications. Overall, the breadth of novel peptide- or protein-based therapeutics moving through the pipeline each year supports a path forward for the pursuit of even more complex therapeutic strategies.",2023-02-10
36820649,Dual-Bioorthogonal Catalysis by a Palladium Peptide Complex.,"Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) enrich bioorthogonal chemistry with new-to-nature reactions while limiting metal deactivation and toxicity. This enables biomedical applications such as activating therapeutics <i>in situ</i>. However, while combination therapies are becoming widespread anticancer treatments, dual catalysis by ArMs has not yet been shown. We present a heptapeptidic ArM with a novel peptide ligand carrying a methyl salicylate palladium complex. We observed that the peptide scaffold reduces metal toxicity while protecting the metal from deactivation by cellular components. Importantly, the peptide also improves catalysis, suggesting involvement in the catalytic reaction mechanism. Our work shows how a palladium-peptide homogeneous catalyst can simultaneously mediate two types of chemistry to synthesize anticancer drugs in human cells. Methyl salicylate palladium LLEYLKR peptide (<b>2-Pd</b>) succeeded to simultaneously produce paclitaxel by depropargylation, and linifanib by Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling in cell culture, thereby achieving combination therapy on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells.",2023-02-23
36807368,"Rice-memolin, a novel peptide derived from rice bran, improves cognitive function after oral administration in mice.","Many people eat polished rice, while rice bran, a by-product known to be rich in protein and expected to have potential functions for health benefits, has not been effectively utilized. In this study, we determined that orally administered Val-Tyr-Thr-Pro-Gly (VYTPG) derived from rice bran protein improved cognitive decline in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). It was demonstrated that VYTPG was released from model peptides corresponding to fragment sequences of original rice proteins (Os01g0941500, Os01g0872700, and allergenic protein) after treatment with thermolysin, a microorganism-derived enzyme often used in industrial scale processes. The thermolysin digest also improved cognitive decline after oral administration in mice. Because VYTPG (1.0 mg/kg) potently improved cognitive decline and is enzymatically produced from the rice bran, we named it rice-memolin. Next, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the cognitive decline improvement associated with rice-memolin. Methyllycaconitine, an antagonist for α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, suppressed the rice-memolin-induced effect, suggesting that rice-memolin improved cognitive decline coupled to the acetylcholine system. Rice-memolin increased the number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells and promoted the mRNA expression of EGF and FGF-2 in the hippocampus, implying that these neurotropic factors play a role in hippocampal neurogenesis after rice-memolin administration. Epidemiologic studies demonstrated that diabetes is a risk factor for dementia; therefore, we also examined the effect of rice-memolin on glucose metabolism. Rice-memolin improved glucose intolerance. In conclusion, we identified a novel rice-derived peptide that can improve cognitive decline. The mechanisms are associated with acetylcholine and hippocampal neurogenesis. Rice-memolin is the first rice-brain-derived peptide able to improve cognitive decline.",2023-02-18
36796263,A novel ESKAPE-sensitive peptide with enhanced stability and its application in controlling multiple bacterial contaminations in chilled fresh pork.,"The co-existence of various pathogenic bacteria on the surface of pork products exacerbates difficulties in food safety control. Developing broad-spectrum and stable antibacterial agents that are not antibiotics is an unmet need. To address this issue, all l-arginine residues of a reported peptide (IIRR)<sub>4</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub> (zp80) were substituted with the corresponding D enantiomers. This novel peptide (IIrr)<sub>4</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub> (zp80r) was expected to maintain favourable bioactivity against ESKAPE strains and have enhanced proteolytic stability compared with zp80. In a series of experiments, zp80r maintained favourable bioactivities against starvation-induced persisters. Electron microscopy and fluorescent dye assays were used to verify the antibacterial mechanism of zp80r. Importantly, zp80r reduced bacterial colonies in chilled fresh pork contaminated with multiple bacterial species. This newly designed peptide is a potential antibacterial candidate to combat problematic foodborne pathogens during storage of pork.",2023-02-09
36793737,"DSP-0509, a systemically available TLR7 agonist, exhibits combination effect with immune checkpoint blockade by activating anti-tumor immune effects.","TLR7 is an innate immune receptor that recognizes single-stranded RNAs, and its activation leads to anti-tumor immune effects. Although it is the only approved TLR7 agonist in cancer therapy, imiquimod is allowed to be administered with topical formulation. Thus, systemic administrative TLR7 agonist is expected in terms of expanding applicable cancer types. Here, we demonstrated the identification and characterization of DSP-0509 as a novel small-molecule TLR7 agonist. DSP-0509 is designed to have unique physicochemical features that could be administered systemically with a short half-life. DSP-0509 activated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and induced inflammatory cytokines including type I interferons. In the LM8 tumor-bearing mouse model, DSP-0509 reduced tumor growth not only in subcutaneous primary lesions but also in lung metastatic lesions. DSP-0509 inhibited tumor growth in several syngeneic tumor-bearing mouse models. We found that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration of tumor before treatment tended to be positively correlated with anti-tumor efficacy in several mouse tumor models. The combination of DSP-0509 with anti-PD-1 antibody significantly enhanced the tumor growth inhibition compared to each monotherapy in CT26 model mice. In addition, the effector memory T cells were expanded in both the peripheral blood and tumor, and rejection of tumor re-challenge occurred in the combination group. Moreover, synergistic anti-tumor efficacy and effector memory T cell upregulation were also observed for the combination with anti-CTLA-4 antibody. The analysis of the tumor-immune microenvironment by using the nCounter assay revealed that the combination of DSP-0509 with anti-PD-1 antibody enhanced infiltration by multiple immune cells including cytotoxic T cells. In addition, the T cell function pathway and antigen presentation pathway were activated in the combination group. We confirmed that DSP-0509 enhanced the anti-tumor immune effects of anti-PD-1 antibody by inducing type I interferons <i>via</i> activation of dendritic cells and even CTLs. In conclusion, we expect that DSP-0509, a new TLR7 agonist that synergistically induces anti-tumor effector memory T cells with immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) and can be administered systemically, will be used in the treatment of multiple cancers.",2023-01-30
36793594,"MS0621, a novel small-molecule modulator of Ewing sarcoma chromatin accessibility, interacts with an RNA-associated macromolecular complex and influences RNA splicing.","Ewing sarcoma is a cancer of children and young adults characterized by the critical translocation-associated fusion oncoprotein EWSR1::FLI1. EWSR1::FLI1 targets characteristic genetic loci where it mediates aberrant chromatin and the establishment of <i>de novo</i> enhancers. Ewing sarcoma thus provides a model to interrogate mechanisms underlying chromatin dysregulation in tumorigenesis. Previously, we developed a high-throughput chromatin-based screening platform based on the <i>de novo</i> enhancers and demonstrated its utility in identifying small molecules capable of altering chromatin accessibility. Here, we report the identification of MS0621, a molecule with previously uncharacterized mechanism of action, as a small molecule modulator of chromatin state at sites of aberrant chromatin accessibility at EWSR1::FLI1-bound loci. MS0621 suppresses cellular proliferation of Ewing sarcoma cell lines by cell cycle arrest. Proteomic studies demonstrate that MS0621 associates with EWSR1::FLI1, RNA binding and splicing proteins, as well as chromatin regulatory proteins. Surprisingly, interactions with chromatin and many RNA-binding proteins, including EWSR1::FLI1 and its known interactors, were RNA-independent. Our findings suggest that MS0621 affects EWSR1::FLI1-mediated chromatin activity by interacting with and altering the activity of RNA splicing machinery and chromatin modulating factors. Genetic modulation of these proteins similarly inhibits proliferation and alters chromatin in Ewing sarcoma cells. The use of an oncogene-associated chromatin signature as a target allows for a direct approach to screen for unrecognized modulators of epigenetic machinery and provides a framework for using chromatin-based assays for future therapeutic discovery efforts.",2023-01-30
36773708,Allosteric inhibition of HSP70 in collaboration with STUB1 augments enzalutamide efficacy in antiandrogen resistant prostate tumor and patient-derived models.,"Ubiquitin proteasome activity is suppressed in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells, and the heat shock protein 70/STIP1 homology and U-box-containing protein 1 (HSP70/STUB1) machinery are involved in androgen receptor (AR) and AR variant protein stabilization. Targeting HSP70 could be a viable strategy to overcome resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we showed that a novel HSP70 allosteric inhibitor, JG98, significantly suppressed drug-resistant C4-2B MDVR and CWR22Rv1 cell growth, and enhanced enzalutamide treatment. JG98 also suppressed cell growth in conditional reprogramed cell cultures (CRCs) and organoids derived from advanced prostate cancer patient samples. Mechanistically, JG98 degraded AR/AR-V7 expression in resistant cells and promoted STUB1 nuclear translocation to bind AR-V7. Knockdown of the E3 ligase STUB1 significantly diminished the anticancer effects and partially restored AR-V7 inhibitory effects of JG98. JG231, a more potent analog developed from JG98, effectively suppressed the growth of the drug-resistant prostate cancer cells, CRCs, and organoids. Notably, the combination of JG231 and enzalutamide synergistically inhibited AR/AR-V7 expression and suppressed CWR22Rv1 xenograft tumor growth. Inhibition of HSP70 using novel small-molecule inhibitors coordinates with STUB1 to regulate AR/AR-V7 protein stabilization and ARSI resistance.",2023-02-10
36768348,Inhibition of Neutral Sphingomyelinase 2 by Novel Small Molecule Inhibitors Results in Decreased Release of Extracellular Vesicles by Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells and Attenuated Calcification.,"Vascular calcification (VC) is an important contributor and prognostic factor in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. VC is an active process mediated by the release of extracellular vesicles by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and the enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2 or SMPD3) plays a key role. Upon activation, the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, thereby generating ceramide and phosphocholine. This conversion mediates the release of exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which ultimately forms the nidus for VC. nSMase2 therefore represents a drug target, the inhibition of which is thought to prevent or halt VC progression. In search of novel druglike small molecule inhibitors of nSMase2, we have used virtual ligand screening to identify potential ligands. From an in-silico collection of 48,6844 small druglike molecules, we selected 996 compounds after application of an in-house multi-step procedure combining different filtering and docking procedures. Selected compounds were functionally tested in vitro; from this, we identified 52 individual hit molecules that inhibited nSMase2 activity by more than 20% at a concentration of 150 µM. Further analysis showed that five compounds presented with IC<sub>50</sub>s lower than 2 µM. Of these, compounds ID 5728450 and ID 4011505 decreased human primary VSMC EV release and calcification in vitro. The hit molecules identified here represent new classes of nSMase2 inhibitors that may be developed into lead molecules for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of VC.",2023-01-19
36768267,Definition and Characterization of SOX11-Derived T Cell Epitopes towards Immunotherapy of Glioma.,"The transcription factor SOX11 is a tumor-associated antigen with low expression in normal cells, but overexpression in glioblastoma (GBM). So far, conventional surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have not substantially improved the dismal prognosis of relapsed/refractory GBM patients. Immunotherapy is considered a promising strategy against GBM, but there is a fervent need for better immunotargets in GBM. To this end, we performed an in silico prediction study on SOX11, which primarily yielded ten promising HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides derived from SOX11. We defined a novel peptide FMACSPVAL, which had the highest score according to in silico prediction (6.02 nM by NetMHC-4.0) and showed an exquisite binding affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule in the peptide-binding assays. In the IFN-γ ELISPOT assays, FMACSPVAL demonstrated a high efficiency for generating SOX11-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Nine out of thirty-two healthy donors showed a positive response to SOX11, as assessed by the ELISPOT assays. Therefore, this novel antigen peptide epitope seems to be promising as a target for T cell-based immunotherapy in GBM. The adoptive transfer of in vitro elicited SOX11-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells constitutes a potential approach for the treatment of GBM patients.",2023-01-18
36768205,DeepsmirUD: Prediction of Regulatory Effects on microRNA Expression Mediated by Small Molecules Using Deep Learning.,"Aberrant miRNA expression has been associated with a large number of human diseases. Therefore, targeting miRNAs to regulate their expression levels has become an important therapy against diseases that stem from the dysfunction of pathways regulated by miRNAs. In recent years, small molecules have demonstrated enormous potential as drugs to regulate miRNA expression (i.e., SM-miR). A clear understanding of the mechanism of action of small molecules on the upregulation and downregulation of miRNA expression allows precise diagnosis and treatment of oncogenic pathways. However, outside of a slow and costly process of experimental determination, computational strategies to assist this on an ad hoc basis have yet to be formulated. In this work, we developed, to the best of our knowledge, the first cross-platform prediction tool, DeepsmirUD, to infer small-molecule-mediated regulatory effects on miRNA expression (i.e., upregulation or downregulation). This method is powered by 12 cutting-edge deep-learning frameworks and achieved AUC values of 0.843/0.984 and AUCPR values of 0.866/0.992 on two independent test datasets. With a complementarily constructed network inference approach based on similarity, we report a significantly improved accuracy of 0.813 in determining the regulatory effects of nearly 650 associated SM-miR relations, each formed with either novel small molecule or novel miRNA. By further integrating miRNA-cancer relationships, we established a database of potential pharmaceutical drugs from 1343 small molecules for 107 cancer diseases to understand the drug mechanisms of action and offer novel insight into drug repositioning. Furthermore, we have employed DeepsmirUD to predict the regulatory effects of a large number of high-confidence associated SM-miR relations. Taken together, our method shows promise to accelerate the development of potential miRNA targets and small molecule drugs.",2023-01-18
36763100,Therapeutic potential of FLT4-targeting peptide in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Previously, we found that dysfunctional natural killer (NK) cells with low interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were restored in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by the FLT4 antagonist MAZ51. Here, we developed 12 peptides targeting FLT4 for clinical application and examined whether they restored the frequency of lymphocytes, especially T cells and NK cells, and high IFN-γ expression, as MAZ51 treatment did in our previous study. Although clinical data from using peptides are currently available, peptides targeting FLT4 to modulate immune cells have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we focus on novel peptide 4 (P4) from the intracellular domain of FLT4 because it had dominant negative activity. Similar to MAZ51, high IFN-γ levels were expressed in AML-mononuclear cells exposed to P4. Additionally, T and NK cell levels were restored, as were high IFN-γ levels, in a leukemic environment when P4 was treated. Interestingly, the regulatory T cells were significantly decreased by P4, implying the role of peptide in tumor niche. Overall, we demonstrated the therapeutic value of functionally modulating lymphocytes using a peptide targeting FLT4 and proposed the development of advanced therapeutic approaches against AML by using immune cells.",2023-02-10

The blockade of binding fibrinogen by glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa) inhibitors has become a new therapeutic approach against MI/R injury. In this study, we modified the RGD structure to combine with scutellarin and synthesized a novel peptide, scutellarin-HomoArg-Gly-Asp-Trp-NH<sub>2</sub> (WK001). Herein, reported experimental and docking evidence indicates that WK001 provides immediate and potent platelet inhibition, with stronger inhibition of platelet aggregation than eptifibatide and scutellarin. In particular, it is administered intravenously to prevent thrombus formation and attenuate myocardial fibrosis progression in vivo. Therefore, WK001 could be developed as an antiplatelet drug to treat thrombosis-associated diseases, such as stroke and myocardial infarction.",2023-02-05
36736525,Pharmacological characterization of novel small molecule agonists and antagonists for the orphan receptor GPR139.,"The orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR139 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and has attracted considerable interest as a therapeutic target. However, the biological role of this receptor remains somewhat elusive, in part due to the lack of quality pharmacological tools to investigate GPR139 function. In an effort to understand GPR139 signaling and to identify improved compounds, in this study we performed virtual screening and analog searches, in combination with multiple pharmacological assays. We characterized GPR139-dependent signaling using previously published reference agonists in Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and inositol monophosphate accumulation assays, as well as a novel real-time GPR139 internalization assay. For the four reference agonists tested, the rank order of potency was conserved across signaling and internalization assays: JNJ-63533054 > Compound 1a » Takeda > AC4 > DL43, consistent with previously reported values. We noted an increased efficacy of JNJ-63533054-mediated inositol monophosphate signaling and internalization, relative to Compound 1a. We then performed virtual screening for GPR139 agonist and antagonist compounds that were screened and validated in GPR139 functional assays. We identified four GPR139 agonists that were active in all assays, with similar or reduced potency relative to known compounds. Likewise, compound analogs selected based on GPR139 agonist and antagonist substructure searches behaved similarly to their parent compounds. Thus, we have characterized GPR139 signaling for multiple new ligands using G protein-dependent assays and a new real-time internalization assay. These data add to the GPR139 tool compound repertoire, which could be optimized in future medical chemistry campaigns.",2023-02-02
36730098,A Thrombin-Activated Peptide-Templated Nanozyme for Remedying Ischemic Stroke via Thrombolytic and Neuroprotective Actions.,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of disability and death. Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome ischemic and reperfusion damage. In this work, a novel peptide-templated manganese dioxide nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO<sub>2</sub> ) is designed that integrates the thrombolytic activity of functional peptides with the reactive oxygen species scavenging ability of nanozymes. Through self-assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide-templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross the blood-brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is ""switched-on"" by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO<sub>2</sub> prolongs the blood-circulation time and exhibits strong thrombolytic action, and reduces the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide-templated nanozyme also effectively inhibits the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that the rationally designed PNzyme/MnO<sub>2</sub> nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half-life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.",2023-03-10
36726760,A hnRNPA2B1 agonist effectively inhibits HBV and SARS-CoV-2 omicron <i>in vivo</i>.,"The twenty-first century has already recorded more than ten major epidemics or pandemics of viral disease, including the devastating COVID-19. Novel effective antivirals with broad-spectrum coverage are urgently needed. Herein, we reported a novel broad-spectrum antiviral compound PAC5. Oral administration of PAC5 eliminated HBV cccDNA and reduced the large antigen load in distinct mouse models of HBV infection. Strikingly, oral administration of PAC5 in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 omicron (BA.1) infection significantly decreases viral loads and attenuates lung inflammation. Mechanistically, PAC5 binds to a pocket near Asp49 in the RNA recognition motif of hnRNPA2B1. PAC5-bound hnRNPA2B1 is extensively activated and translocated to the cytoplasm where it initiates the TBK1-IRF3 pathway, leading to the production of type I IFNs with antiviral activity. Our results indicate that PAC5 is a novel small-molecule agonist of hnRNPA2B1, which may have a role in dealing with emerging infectious diseases now and in the future.",2022-07-15

36715096,Novel small-molecule compound VCP979 attenuates renal fibrosis in male rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction.,"Renal fibrosis is a hallmark of chronic kidney disease, while efficient therapy against renal fibrosis is still lacking. In this study, we investigated the role of a novel small-molecule compound VCP979 on renal fibrosis and inflammation in a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). One week after the UUO surgery, rats were administered VCP979 by gavage for one week, and after treatment, magnetic resonance imaging of T1rho mapping and histopathological analysis were performed to evaluate renal fibrosis <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i>. This study showed that treatment with VCP979 effectively reduced renal fibrosis, extracellular matrix accumulation, and alleviated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in UUO rats, as well as improved renal function. <i>In vivo</i> T1rho mapping displayed increased T1rho values in the UUO rats, which was decreased after VCP979 treatment, and a positive correlation was detected between the T1rho values and the percentage of fibrotic area. Moreover, the administration of VCP979 also ameliorated the inflammatory cytokines expression and the infiltration of macrophages in renal tissues. Mechanistically, VCP979 treatment inhibited the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-kappa B, and transforming growth factor-β1/Smads signaling pathways. These results indicated that VCP979 could be an effective therapeutic agent for alleviating renal fibrosis and inflammation in the rat model of UUO via its antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects.",2023-01-30
36714919,Advances in the discovery of new chemotypes through ultra-large library docking.,"The size and complexity of virtual screening libraries in drug discovery have skyrocketed in recent years, reaching up to multiple billions of accessible compounds. However, virtual screening of such ultra-large libraries poses several challenges associated with preparing the libraries, sampling, and pre-selection of suitable compounds. The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted screening approaches, such as deep learning, poses a promising countermeasure to deal with this rapidly expanding chemical space. For example, various AI-driven methods were recently successfully used to identify novel small molecule inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>).",2023-02-02
36711986,HuR inhibition reduces post-ischemic cardiac remodeling by dampening acute inflammatory gene expression and the innate immune response.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the resulting cardiac remodeling is a common cause of heart failure. The RNA binding protein Human Antigen R (HuR) has been previously shown to reduce cardiac remodeling following both I/R and cardiac pressure overload, but the full extent of the HuR-dependent mechanisms within cells of the myocardium have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we applied a novel small molecule inhibitor of HuR to define the functional role of HuR in the acute response to I/R injury and gain a better understanding of the HuR-dependent mechanisms during post-ischemic myocardial remodeling. Our results show an early (two hours post-I/R) increase in HuR activity that is necessary for early inflammatory gene expression by cardiomyocytes in response to I/R. Surprisingly, despite the reductions in early inflammatory gene expression at two hours post-I/R, HuR inhibition has no effect on initial infarct size at 24-hours post-I/R. However, in agreement with previously published work, we do see a reduction in pathological remodeling and preserved cardiac function at two weeks post-I/R upon HuR inhibition. RNA-sequencing analysis of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) at two hours post-LPS treatment to model damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-mediated activation of toll like receptors (TLRs) demonstrates a broad HuR-dependent regulation of pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine gene expression in cardiomyocytes. We show that conditioned media from NRVMs pre-treated with HuR inhibitor loses the ability to induce inflammatory gene expression in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) compared to NRVMs treated with LPS alone. Functionally, HuR inhibition in NRVMs also reduces their ability to induce endocrine migration of peripheral blood monocytes <i>in vitro</i> and reduces post-ischemic macrophage infiltration to the heart <i>in vivo.</i> In summary, these results suggest a HuR-dependent expression of pro-inflammatory gene expression by cardiomyocytes that leads to subsequent monocyte recruitment and macrophage activation in the post-ischemic myocardium.",2023-01-18
36709658,"Development and validation of LC-MS/MS method for determining the metabolic stability, pharmacokinetics, and dose proportionality of a novel anti-inflammatory cofilin inhibitor.","A novel small molecule cofilin inhibitor (SZ-3) has recently become the focus of investigation for targeting neuroinflammation in different neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, the metabolic stability, blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and tissue concentration of SZ-3 were evaluated to support our future studies. In silico drug metabolism prediction was investigated using the StarDrop WhichP450 module. LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated to quantify the SZ-3 for in-vitro and in-vivo studies. The in-vitro metabolic stability was performed using human liver microsomes (HLMs), and the in-vivo pharmacokinetics were investigated in mice after a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection or oral (P.O.) administration, followed by a collection of blood and brain samples at different time points. The dose-proportionality was also evaluated after a single IP injection of three ascending doses (5, 10, and 25 mg/kg). In-vitro results showed that SZ-3 has a moderate intrinsic clearance (Cl<sub>int</sub>) value of 17.42 ml/min/mg with a half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) value of 39.77 mins, indicative of good bioavailability. In vivo study revealed that SZ-3 was rapidly absorbed, entered the brain, and yielded a good concentration of the unbound drug after IP and oral administration. However, the higher maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) values of IP and P.O. (2244 ng/ml and 1069 ng/g, respectively) revealed that the IP administration led to higher blood and brain concentrations than the P.O. Furthermore, C<sub>max</sub> and area under the curve (AUC) of SZ-3 increased in a dose-proportional manner between the three ascending doses. These results will guide us in optimizing the dosing regimen for future SZ-3 pharmacological studies targeting neuroinflammation.",2023-01-24
36696800,Identification and characterization of a first-generation inhibitor of claudin-1 in colon cancer progression and metastasis.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of the cancer-related deaths worldwide. Thus, developing novel and targeted therapies for inhibiting CRC progression and metastasis is urgent. Several studies, including ours, have reported a causal role for an upregulated claudin-1 expression in promoting CRC metastasis through the activation of the Src and β-catenin-signaling. In murine models of colon tumorigenesis, claudin-1 overexpression promotes oncogenic properties such as transformation and invasiveness. Conversely, the downregulation of claudin-1 inhibits colon tumorigenesis. Despite being a desirable target for cancer treatment, there are currently no known claudin-1 inhibitors with antitumor efficacy. Using a rigorous analytical design and implementing in- vitro and in-vivo testing and a brief medicinal chemistry campaign, we identified a claudin-1-specific inhibitor and named it I-6. Despite its high potency, I-6 was rapidly cleared in human liver microsomes. We, therefore, synthesized I-6 analogs and discovered a novel small molecule, PDS-0330. We determined that PDS0330 inhibits claudin-1-dependent CRC progression without exhibiting toxicity in in-vitro and in-vivo models of CRC and that it binds directly and specifically to claudin-1 with micromolar affinity. Further analyses revealed that PDS-0330 exhibits antitumor and chemosensitizer activities with favorable pharmacokinetic properties by inhibiting the association with metastatic oncogene Src. Overall, our data propose that PDS-0330 interferes with claudin-1/Src association to inhibit CRC progression and metastasis. Our findings are of direct clinical relevance and may open new therapeutic opportunities in colon cancer treatment and/or management by targeting claudin-1.",2023-01-23
36685223,New natural compound inhibitors of PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor α) based on computational study for high-grade glioma therapy.,"High-grade glioma (HGG) is a malignant brain tumor that is common and aggressive in children and adults. In the current medical paradigm, surgery and radiotherapy are the standard treatments for HGG patients. Despite this, the overall prognosis is still very bleak. Studies have shown that platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) is an essential target to treat tumors and inhibiting the activity of PDGFRA can improve the prognosis of HGG. Thus, PDGFRA inhibitors are critical to developing drugs and cancer treatment.",2023-01-04
36683422,"Orelabrutinib in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma patients: Multi-center, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study.","Orelabrutinib is a novel, small molecule, selective irreversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients with refractory or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). This is single-arm, multi-center, open-label, phase 2 study in 80 eligible Chinese patients, who were treated with monotherapy of orelabrutinib at 150 mg once daily. Overall response rate evaluated by an independent review committee was the primary endpoint, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Independent review committee assessed overall response rate was 92.5% (74/80); complete response 21.3% (17/80), partial response 60.0% (48/80), partial response with lymphocytosis 11.3% (9/80). At a 32.3-month median follow-up, the median progression-free survival had not been achieved, while the 30-month progression-free survival rate and overall survival rates were 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.5-79.6) and 81.3% (95% CI, 70.8-88.2), respectively. Orelabrutinib also revealed substantial response in patients with high prognostic risks: overall response rates of patients carrying positive TP53 mutational status or del(17p), del(11q), as well as unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene were 100%, 94.7%, and 93.9%, respectively. Most adverse events were in low grade, with 86.8% of AEs being Grade 1 or 2. Nearly 67% of patients were still receiving orelabrutinib after almost a 3-year follow-up. In conclusion, Orelabrutinib demonstrated compelling efficacy as well as safety profiles, with a noteworthy number of patients obtaining complete response in refractory or relapsed CLL/SLL.",2023-01-22
36678572,Identification of Novel Small Molecule Ligands for JAK2 Pseudokinase Domain.,"Hyperactive mutation V617F in the JAK2 regulatory pseudokinase domain (JH2) is prevalent in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Here, we identified novel small molecules that target JH2 of JAK2 V617F and characterized binding via biochemical and structural approaches. Screening of 107,600 small molecules resulted in identification of 55 binders to the ATP-binding pocket of recombinant JAK2 JH2 V617F protein at a low hit rate of 0.05%, which indicates unique structural characteristics of the JAK2 JH2 ATP-binding pocket. Selected hits and structural analogs were further assessed for binding to JH2 and JH1 (kinase) domains of JAK family members (JAK1-3, TYK2) and for effects on MPN model cell viability. Crystal structures were determined with JAK2 JH2 wild-type and V617F. The JH2-selective binders were identified in diaminotriazole, diaminotriazine, and phenylpyrazolo-pyrimidone chemical entities, but they showed low-affinity, and no inhibition of MPN cells was detected, while compounds binding to both JAK2 JH1 and JH2 domains inhibited MPN cell viability. X-ray crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes indicated generally similar binding modes between the ligands and V617F or wild-type JAK2. Ligands of JAK2 JH2 V617F are applicable as probes in JAK-STAT research, and SAR optimization combined with structural insights may yield higher-affinity inhibitors with biological activity.",2023-01-04
36672201,Preclinical Evaluation of a Novel Small Molecule LCC-21 to Suppress Colorectal Cancer Malignancy by Inhibiting Angiogenic and Metastatic Signatures.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers, and it frequently metastasizes to the liver and lymph nodes. Despite major advances in treatment modalities, CRC remains a poorly characterized biological malignancy, with high reported cases of deaths globally. Moreover, cancer stem cells (CSCs) and their microenvironment have been widely shown to promote colon cancer development, progression, and metastasis. Therefore, an understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of CSCs and their markers in CRC is crucial in efforts to treat cancer metastasis and develop specific therapeutic targets for augmenting current standard treatments. Herein, we applied computational simulations using bioinformatics to identify potential theranostic markers for CRC. We identified the overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-α (<i>VEGFA</i>)/β-catenin/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7/Cluster of Differentiation 44 (<i>CD44</i>) in CRC to be associated with cancer progression, stemness, resistance to therapy, metastasis, and poor clinical outcomes. To further investigate, we explored in silico molecular docking, which revealed potential inhibitory activities of LCC-21 as a potential multitarget small molecule for <i>VEGF-A/CTNNB1/MMP7/CD44</i> oncogenic signatures, with the highest binding affinities displayed. We validated these finding in vitro and demonstrated that LCC-21 inhibited colony and sphere formation, migration, and invasion, and these results were further confirmed by a Western blot analysis in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells. Thus, the inhibitory effects of LCC-21 on these angiogenic and onco-immunogenic signatures could be of translational relevance as potential CRC biomarkers for early diagnosis.",2023-01-09
36669545,"Snake venom nerve growth factor-inspired designing of novel peptide therapeutics for the prevention of paraquat-induced apoptosis, neurodegeneration, and alteration of metabolic pathway genes in the rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cell.","Neurodegenerative disorders (ND), associated with the progressive loss of neurons, oxidative stress-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial dysfunction, can be treated with synthetic peptides possessing innate neurotrophic effects and neuroprotective activity. Computational analysis of two small synthetic peptides (trideca-neuropeptide, TNP; heptadeca-neuropeptide, HNP) developed from the nerve growth factors from snake venoms predicted their significant interaction with the human TrkA receptor (TrkA). In silico results were validated by an in vitro binding study of the FITC-conjugated custom peptides to rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cell TrkA receptors. Pre-treatment of PC-12 cells with TNP and HNP induced neuritogenesis and significantly reduced the paraquat (PT)-induced cellular toxicity, the release of lactate dehydrogenase from the cell cytoplasm, production of intracellular ROS, restored the level of antioxidants, prevented alteration of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and inhibited cellular apoptosis. These peptides lack in vitro cytotoxicity, haemolytic activity, and platelet-modulating properties and do not interfere with the blood coagulation system. Functional proteomic analyses demonstrated the reversal of PT-induced upregulated and downregulated metabolic pathway genes in PC-12 cells that were pre-treated with HNP and revealed the metabolic pathways regulated by HNP to induce neuritogenesis and confer protection against PT-induced neuronal damage in PC-12. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the PT-induced increased and decreased expression of critical pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes had been restored in the PC-12 cells pre-treated with the custom peptides. A network gene expression profile was proposed to elucidate the molecular interactions among the regulatory proteins for HNP to salvage the PT-induced damage. Taken together, our results show how the peptides can rescue PT-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular death and suggest new opportunities for developing neuroprotective drugs.",2023-01-18
36668683,Novel HER2-Targeted Peptide for NIR-II Imaging of Tumor.,"Molecular targets serve a crucial role in drug development. Herein, we discovered a novel peptide that can specifically target the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and thus named it Herceptide. In our study, Herceptide was conjugated to the near-infrared fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) to obtain a probe, ICG-Herceptide. Importantly, specific binding to HER2 was revealed by molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and competition assays. The probe showed high binding affinity (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub> = 1.03 nM) and fast binding property (<i>k</i><sub>on</sub> = 0.44 min<sup>-1</sup>). In vivo near-infrared window two (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) imaging in HER2-overexpressed SKOV3 tumor-bearing mice demonstrated a high tumor-to-normal tissue signal ratio (T/N = 7.3) at 8 h postinjection. In the blocking study, ICG-Herceptide coinjected with Herceptide only showed a weak tumor signal. In other HER2 high-expression tumors, such as non-small-cell lung cancer A549 and gastric cancer MKN45, the tumor-to-normal tissue signal ratios (T/N) were 4.1 and 4.7, respectively. In contrast, HER2 low-expression tumor MDAMB231 shows no imaging contrast between the tumor and normal tissues. Furthermore, tumor resection was successfully performed under the guidance of the ICG-Herceptide-based NIR-II imaging in subcutaneous SKOV3 mice models. The biocompatibility study indicated that the probe had no observable toxicity to cells and tissues. Overall, these results demonstrate that ICG-Herceptide is a promising optical probe for the diagnosis and localization of HER2-overexpressing tumors. Moreover, Herceptide is a novel HER2-targeting peptide and can be further used for developing theranostic agents.",2023-01-20
36658088,Defining the role of mTOR pathway in the regulation of stem cells of glioblastoma.,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase, functions by forming two multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal brain tumor that remains incurable partly due to the existence of untreatable cancer stem cells (CSC). The pathogenesis of GBM is largely due to the loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which is implicated in the aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway. The major cause of tumor recurrence, growth, and invasion is the presence of the unique population of CSC. Resistance to conventional therapies appears to be caused by both extensive genetic abnormalities and dysregulation of the transcription landscape. Consequently, CSCs have emerged as targets of interest in new treatment paradigms. Evidence suggests that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can also be applied to target CSCs. Here we explored the role of the mTOR pathway in the regulation of stem cells of GBM by treating them with inhibitors of canonical PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways such as rapamycin (mTORC1 inhibitor), PP242 (ATP binding mTORC1/2 inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), and MAPK inhibitor, U0126. A significant number of GBM tumors expressed stem cell marker nestin and activated mTOR (pmTOR<sup>Ser2448</sup>), with most tumor cells co-expressing both markers. The expression of stem cell marker NANOG was suppressed following rapamycin treatment. The neurospheres were disrupted following rapamycin and LY294002 treatments. Rapamycin or PP242 along with differentiating agent All-trans-retinoic acid reduced stem cell proliferation. Treatment with novel small molecule inhibitors of mTORC1/2 demonstrated that Torin1 and Torin2 suppressed the proliferation of GBM CSC, while XL388 was less effective. Torin1 and XL388 delay the process of self-renewal as compared to controls, whereas Torin2 halted self-renewal. Torin2 was able to eradicate tumor cells. In conclusion, Torin2 effectively targeted CSCs of GBM by halting self-renewal and inhibiting cell proliferation, underscoring the use of Torin2 in the treatment of GBM.",2022-12-31

36622852,BET-HDAC Dual Inhibitors for Combinational Treatment of Breast Cancer and Concurrent Candidiasis.,"Breast cancer is susceptible to <i>Candida</i> infections, and candidiasis has an enhancing effect on the progression and metastasis of tumor. Breast cancer and concurrent candidiasis represent a significant challenge in clinical therapy. Herein, a series of novel small molecule inhibitors simultaneously targeting bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) were designed for combinational treatment of breast cancer and resistant <i>Candida albicans</i> infections. Among them, compounds <b>13c</b> and <b>17b</b> exhibited excellent and balanced inhibitory activity against both BET family proteins BRD4 and HDAC1. As compared with BRD4 or HDAC1 inhibitors, dual inhibitors <b>13c</b> and <b>17b</b> displayed improved <i>in vivo</i> antitumor efficacy in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft models. Notably, they synergized with fluconazole (FLC) to effectively reduce the kidney fungal burden in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis.

36611895,Elabela: Negative Regulation of Ferroptosis in Trophoblasts via the Ferritinophagy Pathway Implicated in the Pathogenesis of Preeclampsia.,"Preeclampsia is a leading contributor to increased maternal morbidity and mortality in the perinatal period. Increasing evidence demonstrates that ferroptosis is an essential mechanism for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Elabela is a novel small-molecule polypeptide, mainly expressed in embryonic and transplacental tissues, with an ability to promote cell proliferation and invasion. However, its specific regulatory mechanism in preeclampsia has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we first reveal an increased grade of ferroptosis accompanied by a downregulation of the expression of Elabela in preeclampsia placentas. We then confirm the presence of a ferroptosis phenotype in the placenta of the mouse PE-like model, and Elabela can reduce ferroptosis in the placenta and improve adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that targeting Elabela alleviates the cellular dysfunction mediated by Erastin promoting increased lipid peroxidation in vitro. Subsequent mechanistic studies suggest that Elabela increases FTH1 levels by inhibiting the ferritinophagy pathway, and consequently chelates the intracellular labile iron pool and eventually arrests ferroptosis. In conclusion, Elabela deficiency exacerbates ferroptosis in the placenta, which is among the potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Targeting the Elabela-ferritinophagy-ferroptosis signaling axis provides a new therapeutic intervention strategy to alleviate preeclampsia.",2022-12-26

36596342,TAxI-peptide targeted Cas12a ribonuclease protein nanoformulations increase genome editing in hippocampal neurons.,"Gene therapy approaches that utilize Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) ribonucleases have tremendous potential to treat human disease. However, CRISPR therapies delivered by integrating viral vectors are limited by potential off-target genome editing caused by constitutive activation of ribonuclease functions. Thus, biomaterial formulations are being used for the delivery of purified CRISPR components to increase the efficiency and safety of genome editing approaches. We previously demonstrated that a novel peptide identified by phage display, TAxI-peptide, mediates delivery of recombinant proteins into neurons. In this report we utilized NeutrAvidin protein to formulate neuron-targeted genome-editing nanoparticles. Cas12a ribonucleases was loaded with biotinylated guide RNA and biotinylated TAxI-peptide onto NeutrAvidin protein to coordinate the formation a targeted ribonuclease protein (RNP) complex. TAxI-RNP complexes are polydisperse with a 14.3 nm radius. The nanoparticles are stable after formulation and show good stability in the presence of normal mouse serum. TAxI-RNP nanoparticles increased neuronal delivery of Cas12a in reporter mice, resulting in induced tdTomato expression after direct injection into the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. TAxI-RNP nanoparticles also increased genome editing efficacy in hippocampal neurons versus glia. These studies demonstrate the ability to assemble RNP nanoformulations with NeutrAvidin by binding biotinylated peptides and gRNA-loaded Cas12a ribonucleases into protein nanoparticles that target CRISPR delivery to specific cell-types in vivo. The potential to deliver CRISPR nanoparticles to specific cell-types and control off-target delivery to further reduce deleterious genome editing is essential for the creation of viable therapies to treat nervous system disease.",2023-01-09
36593243,Effects of Aficamten on cardiac contractility in a feline translational model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most prevalent inherited cardiac disease in humans and cats and lacks efficacious pharmacologic interventions in the preclinical phase of disease. LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is commonly observed in HCM-affected patients and is a primary driver of heart failure symptoms and reduced quality of life. Novel small-molecule cardiac myosin inhibitors target actin-myosin interactions to alleviate overactive protein interactions. A prospective, randomized, controlled cross-over study was performed to evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of two doses (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) of a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, aficamten (CK-3773274, CK-274), on cardiac function in cats with the A31P MYBPC3 mutation and oHCM. Dose-dependent reductions in LV systolic function, LVOT pressure gradient, and isovolumetric relaxation times compared to baseline were observed. Promising beneficial effects of reduced systolic function warrant further studies of this next-in-class therapeutic to evaluate the benefit of long-term administration in this patient population.",2023-01-02
36591373,Kartogenin Improves Osteogenesis of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells via Autophagy.,"Kartogenin (KGN), a novel small-molecule compound, has been considered a promising chondrogenic promoter in cartilage regeneration. However, whether KGN also participates in osteogenesis and bone regeneration remains unclear. This research was designed to explore the roles of KGN on osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) as well as determine the possible mechanism of osteogenesis. We revealed that KGN enhanced the osteogenic differentiation capacity of BMMSCs without affecting cell proliferation, during which autophagic activities and the expression of autophagy-related genes were promoted. Moreover, KGN upregulated the phosphorylation level of the Smad1/5/9 signaling, and inhibition and activation of Smad signaling were also applied to validate the involvement of Smad in BMMSCs during KGN treatment. In summary, this study shows that KGN promotes osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs through enhancing autophagic levels and upregulating Smad1/5/9 signaling mechanically.",2022-12-22
36590256,Biomimetic Total Synthesis and the Biological Evaluation of Natural Product (-)-Fargesone A as a Novel FXR Agonist.,"Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays an important role in maintaining or reversing metabolic homeostasis during the development of liver diseases. However, developing FXR modulators to intervene in FXR-related diseases is still an unmet clinical need. Therefore, it is significant to develop novel small-molecule agonists for drug discovery targeting FXR. Through a high-throughput chemical screen and follow-up biological validations, we first identified the natural product Fargesone A (FA) as a potent and selective FXR agonist. The limited, variable supply of FA from natural product isolation, however, has impeded its biological exploration and potential drug development. Accordingly, we have developed a biomimetic and scalable total synthesis of FA in nine steps that provides a solution to the supply of FA. Enabled by chemical synthesis, the <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of FA has been further investigated. The results showed that FA alleviates hepatocyte lipid accumulation and cell death in an FXR-dependent manner. Moreover, treatment of bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver disorder with FA ameliorates pathological features in mice. Therefore, our work lays the foundation to develop new small-molecule FXR agonists as a potential therapy for liver diseases.",2022-12-07

36586149,A novel peptide-templated AgNPs nanoprobe for theranostics of prostate cancer.,"Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive exosomes have the potential to serve as highly sensitive biomarkers for prostate cancer detection. Herein, a sensitive electrochemical biosensor for the ultrasensitive detection of PSMA-positive exosomes has been constructed based on a peptide-templated AgNPs nanoprobe. In this work, PSMA-specific binding peptides immobilized on a gold electrode were responsible for prostate cancer-derived exosomes capturing. Well-designed peptide (CCY- LWYIKC) serves a dual role: as a signal probe and as a recognizer in the exosomes-identification process. Specifically, LWYIKC bind to cholesterol at the exosome membranes, and CCY function as peptide templates to host a large number of silver nanoparticles, leading to a strong electrochemical signal. Thus, the concentration of exosomes can be quantified via electrochemical signal. This innovative method displayed a wide detection range of 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> particles/μL and a detection limit as low as 37 particles/μL. Notably, the method has shown outstanding performance when validated using clinical samples, suggesting its potential for clinical applications.",2022-12-16

However, unsatisfactory response rates and immune-related adverse effects limit the use of anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies. Here, we report the discovery and identification of <b>S4-1</b>, an innovative small-molecule inhibitor of PD-L1. <i>In vitro</i>, <b>S4-1</b> effectively altered the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction, induced PD-L1 dimerization and internalization, improved its localization to endoplasmic reticulum, and thus enhanced the cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells toward tumor cells. <i>In vivo</i>, <b>S4-1</b> significantly inhibited tumor growth in both lung and colorectal cancer models, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it led to complete clearance of a portion of the tumor cells. Furthermore, <b>S4-1</b> induced T-cell activation and inversed the inhibitory tumor microenvironment, consistent with the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway blockade. These data support the continued evaluation of <b>S4-1</b> as an alternative ICB therapeutic strategy.",2022-12-29
36565671,Oct-4 activating compound 1 (OAC1) could improve the quality of somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos in the bovine.,"Previous studies described aberrant nuclear reprogramming in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos that is distinctly different from fertilized embryos. This abnormal nuclear reprogramming hampers the proper pre- and/or post-implantation development. It has been demonstrated that SCNT blastocysts aberrantly expressed POU5F1 and POU5F1-related genes. With regard to this, it has been postulated that promoting the expression of POU5F1 in SCNT embryos may enhance reprogramming in SCNT embryos. In this study, we treated either fibroblast donor cells or SCNT embryos with OAC1 as a novel small molecule that has been reported to induce POU5F1 expression. Quantitative results from the MTS assay revealed that lower concentrations of OAC1 (1, 1.5, and 3 μM) are non-toxic after 2, 4, and 6 days, but higher concentrations (6, 8, 10, and 12 μM) are toxic and reduced the proliferation of cells after 6 days. No enhancement in the expression of endogenous POU5F1 was observed when both mouse and bovine fibroblast cells were treated with 1.5 and 3 μM OAC1 for up to 6 consecutive days. Subsequently, we treated either fibroblast as donor cells in the SCNT procedure (BFF-OAC1 group) or SCNT embryos [for 4 days (IVC-OAC1: D4-D7 group) or 7 days (IVC-OAC1: D0-D7 group)] with 1.5 μM OAC1. We observed that neither treatment of fibroblast donor cells nor SCNT embryos improved the cleavage and blastocyst rates. Interestingly, we observed that treatment of SCNT embryos all throughout the in vitro culture (IVC) (IVC-OAC1: D0-D7) with 1.5 μM OAC1 improves the quality of derived blastocyst which was indexed by morphological grading, blastomere allocation, epigenetic marks and mRNA expression of target genes. In conclusion, our results showed that supplementation of IVC medium with 1.5 μM OAC1 (D0-D7) accelerates SCNT reprogramming in bovine species.",2022-11-04
36557929,Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of Small-Molecule Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Abiraterone Conjugate.,"Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer among men. The main method of its treatment is androgen deprivation therapy, which has a wide range of side effects. One of the solutions to this challenge is the targeted delivery of drugs to prostate cancer cells. In this study, we performed the synthesis of a novel small-molecule PSMA-targeted conjugate based on abiraterone. Cytotoxicity, the induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and P450-cytochrome species inhibition were investigated for this conjugate PSMA-abiraterone. The conjugate demonstrated a preferential effect on prostate tumor cells, remaining inactive at up to 100 µM in human fibroblast cells. In addition, it revealed preferential efficacy, specifically on PSMA-expressing lines with a 65% tumor growth inhibition level on 22Rv1 (PSMA+) xenografts after 14-fold oral administration of <b>PSMA-Abi</b> at a single dose of 500 mg/kg (7.0 g/kg total dose) was observed. This compound showed significantly reduced acute toxicity with comparable efficacy compared to <b>AbiAc</b>.",2022-12-12
36555334,Protein Kinase Inhibitors as a New Target for Immune System Modulation and Brain Cancer Management.,"High-grade brain tumors are malignant tumors with poor survival and remain the most difficult tumors to treat. An important contributing factor to the development and progression of brain tumors is their ability to evade the immune system. Several immunotherapeutic strategies including vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors have been studied to improve the effectiveness of the immune system in destroying cancer cells. Recent studies have shown that kinase inhibitors, capable of inhibiting signal transduction cascades that affect cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, have additional immunological effects. In this review, we explain the beneficial therapeutic effects of novel small-molecule kinase inhibitors and explore how, through different mechanisms, they increase the protective antitumor immune response in high-grade brain tumors.",2022-12-10
36545435,A high-throughput effector screen identifies a novel small molecule scaffold for inhibition of ten-eleven translocation dioxygenase 2.,"Ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases (TETs) are the erasers of 5-methylcytosine (mC), the central epigenetic regulator of mammalian DNA. TETs convert mC to three oxidized derivatives with unique physicochemical properties and inherent regulatory potential, and it initializes active demethylation by the base excision repair pathway. Potent small molecule inhibitors would be useful tools to study TET functions by conditional control. To facilitate the discovery of such tools, we here report a high-throughput screening pipeline and its application to screen and validate 31.5k compounds for inhibition of TET2. Using a homogenous fluorescence assay, we discover a novel quinoline-based scaffold that we further validate with an orthogonal semi-high throughput MALDI-MS assay for direct monitoring of substrate turnover. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies involving >20 derivatives of this scaffold led to the identification of optimized inhibitors, and together with computational studies suggested a plausible model for its mode of action.",2022-09-02
36541899,"Novel Peptide from the Hydrolysate of Hybrid Sturgeon (<i>Acipenseridae</i>) Spinal Cord: Isolation, Identification, and Anti-proliferative Effects in Human Cervix Cancer Cells.","Anti-proliferative peptides have recently attracted attention for their excellent bioactivity and biocompatibility. In this paper, five novel anti-proliferative peptides were identified from the hydrolysate of hybrid sturgeon spinal cord (HSSC). In addition, the structure-activity relationship of the novel anti-proliferative peptides was explored. In vitro experiments indicated that the peptide ""VDSVLDVVRK"" presented the highest inhibition of HeLa cell growth in all samples (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.5 μM). VDSVLDVVRK showed a random coil secondary structure and nanomicelles in the tumor microenvironment. Transmission electron microscopy results confirmed that nanomicelles disassemble as the concentration of VDSVLDVVRK decreases. Furthermore, VDSVLDVVRK could induce HeLa cell apoptosis by increasing the expression of Cyt-c (98.65 ± 1.85%, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and caspase-9 (39.85 ± 1.81%, <i>p</i> < 0.01). In this study, the anti-proliferative mechanism of the HSSC peptide was discussed, which provided a theoretical basis for the research and development of anti-proliferative functional food.",2022-12-21
36533828,"A ""Dual-Addition"" Calcium Fluorescence Assay for the High-Throughput Screening of Recombinant G Protein-Coupled Receptors.","G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest superfamily of receptors and are the targets of numerous human drugs. High-throughput screening (HTS) of random small molecule libraries against GPCRs is used by the pharmaceutical industry for target-specific drug discovery. In this study, an HTS was employed to identify novel small-molecule ligands of invertebrate-specific neuropeptide GPCRs as probes for physiological studies of vectors of deadly human and veterinary pathogens. The invertebrate-specific kinin receptor was chosen as a target because it regulates many important physiological processes in invertebrates, including diuresis, feeding, and digestion. Furthermore, the pharmacology of many invertebrate GPCRs is poorly characterized or not characterized at all; therefore, the differential pharmacology of these groups of receptors with respect to the related GPCRs in other metazoans, especially humans, adds knowledge to the structure-activity relationships of GPCRs as a superfamily. An HTS assay was developed for cells in 384-well plates for the discovery of ligands of the kinin receptor from the cattle fever tick, or southern cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus. The tick kinin receptor was stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells. The kinin receptor, when activated by endogenous kinin neuropeptides or other small molecule agonists, triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from calcium stores into the cytoplasm. This calcium fluorescence assay combined with a ""dual-addition"" approach can detect functional agonist and antagonist ""hit"" molecules in the same assay plate. Each assay was conducted using drug plates carrying an array of 320 random small molecules. A reliable Z' factor of 0.7 was obtained, and three agonist and two antagonist hit molecules were identified when the HTS was at a 2 µM final concentration. The calcium fluorescence assay reported here can be adapted to screen other GPCRs that activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling cascade.",2022-12-02
36526019,A novel peptide hydrogel of metal ion clusters for accelerating bone defect regeneration.,"In the absence of adequate treatment, effective bone regeneration remains a great challenge. Exploring hydrogels with properties of excellent bioactivity, stability, non-immunogenicity, and commercialization is an important step to develop hydrogel-based bone regeneration materials. In this study, we engineered a self-assembled chelating peptide hydrogel loaded with an osteogenic metal ion cluster extracted from the processed pyritum decoction, including Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, named processed pyritum hydrogel (PPH). We demonstrated that as a reservoir of beneficial metal ion clusters in bone regeneration, PPH has been shown to regulate a variety of genes in the process of bone regeneration. These genes are mainly involved in extracellular matrix synthesis, cell adhesion and migration, cytokine expression, antimicrobial and inflammation. Therefore, PPH accelerated the progress of various bone healing stages, and shortened the bone healing cycle by 4 weeks. Our investigation outcomes showed that the engineered metal ion cluster hydrogel is a novel, simple, and commercializable bone-regenerating hydrogel with potential clinical use.",2022-12-15
36523977,Structure-based discovery of a novel small-molecule inhibitor of TEAD palmitoylation with anticancer activity.,"The paralogous oncogenic transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ are the distal effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell proliferation, survival and cell fate specification. They are frequently deregulated in most human cancers, where they contribute to multiple aspects of tumorigenesis including growth, metabolism, metastasis and chemo/immunotherapy resistance. Thus, they provide a critical point for therapeutic intervention. However, due to their intrinsically disordered structure, they are challenging to target directly. Since YAP/TAZ exerts oncogenic activity by associating with the TEAD1-4 transcription factors, to regulate target gene expression, YAP activity can be controlled indirectly by regulating TEAD1-4. Interestingly, TEADs undergo autopalmitoylation, which is essential for their stability and function, and small-molecule inhibitors that prevent this posttranslational modification can render them unstable. In this article we report discovery of a novel small molecule inhibitor of YAP activity. We combined structure-based virtual ligand screening with biochemical and cell biological studies and identified JM7, which inhibits YAP transcriptional reporter activity with an IC50 of 972 nMoles/Ltr. Further, it inhibits YAP target gene expression, without affecting YAP/TEAD localization. Mechanistically, JM7 inhibits TEAD palmitoylation and renders them unstable. Cellular thermal shift assay revealed that JM7 directly binds to TEAD1-4 in cells. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of JM7 on YAP activity, it significantly impairs proliferation, colony-formation and migration of mesothelioma (NCI-H226), breast (MDA-MB-231) and ovarian (OVCAR-8) cancer cells that exhibit increased YAP activity. Collectively, these results establish JM7 as a novel lead compound for development of more potent inhibitors of TEAD palmitoylation for treating cancer.",2022-11-29
36513726,A novel small molecule inhibitor of human Drp1.,"Mitochondrial dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is a large GTPase regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and is known to play an important role in numerous pathophysiological processes. Despite being the most widely used Drp1 inhibitor, the specificity of Mdivi-1 towards human Drp1 has not been definitively proven and there have been numerous issues reported with its use including off-target effects. In our hands Mdivi-1 showed varying binding affinities toward human Drp1, potentially impacted by compound aggregation. Herein, we sought to identify a novel small molecule inhibitor of Drp1. From an initial virtual screening, we identified DRP1i27 as a compound which directly bound to the human isoform 3 of Drp1 via surface plasmon resonance and microscale thermophoresis. Importantly, DRP1i27 was found to have a dose-dependent increase in the cellular networks of fused mitochondria but had no effect in Drp1 knock-out cells. Further analogues of this compound were identified and screened, though none displayed greater affinity to human Drp1 isoform 3 than DRP1i27. To date, this is the first small molecule inhibitor shown to directly bind to human Drp1.",2022-12-13
36504887,"Deciphering the immuno-pathological role of FLT, and evaluation of a novel dual inhibitor of topoisomerases and mutant-FLT3 for treating leukemia.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of leukemia with an aggressive phenotype, that commonly occurs in adults and with disappointing treatment outcomes. Genetic alterations were implicated in the etiology of cancers and form the basis for defining patient prognoses and guiding targeted therapies. In the present study, we leveraged bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from AML patients to determine the clinical significance of Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) alterations on the T-cell phenotype and immune response of AML patients. Subsequently, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Lwk-n019, a novel small-molecule derivative of thiochromeno[2,3-c]quinolin-12-one. Our results suggested that FLT3 plays an important role in the progression, aggressive phenotype, and worse immune response of patients. An FLT3 mutation was associated with dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes, and high risk and shorter survival of AML patients. Our findings further suggested that the aggressiveness of AML and the prognostic role of FLT3 are associated with the co-occurrence of NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations. Lwk-n019 demonstrated dose-dependent anticancer activities against various leukemia cancer cell lines. Lwk-n019 demonstrated highly selective kinase inhibitory activities against the wild-type FLT3 (D835V) and mutant FLT3 (internal tandem duplication (ITD), D835V) with >95% and 99% inhibitory levels, respectively. Moreover, the compound demonstrated the best binding constant (Kd value) of 0.77 µM against FLT3 (ITD, 835V). In addition, Lwk-n019 significantly inhibited the activities of both the topoisomerase I (TOPI) and TOPII enzymes, with higher TOPI inhibitory activity than camptothecin, a clinical inhibitor. While the jejunum, duodenum, cecum, and colon were prime sites of absorption, Lwk-n019 achieved maximum concentration (Cmax), Vd, blood/plasma ratio, time to maximum concentration (Tmax), area under the receiver operating concentration curve (AUC)<sub>(0-24)</sub>, and AUC<sub>(0-∞)</sub> values of 0.665 µg/mL, 5.21 Vc, L/kg, 1.5 h, 6634.7, and 6909.2, respectively. In conclusion, Lwk-n019 demonstrated anticancer activities via multi-target inhibition of TOPs and kinases with high inhibition preference for mutant ITD-FLT3. The present pioneer study provides a basis for advanced optimization of drug potency, selectivity, specificity, and other properties desired of anticancer drug leads. Studies are ongoing to determine the full therapeutic properties of Lwk-n019 and the detailed mechanisms of FLT3 in TOP inhibition.",2022-11-15
36490372,Enzymatic Macrolactamization of mRNA Display Libraries for Inhibitor Selection.,"mRNA display is a powerful, high-throughput technology for discovering novel, peptide ligands for protein targets. A number of methods have been used to expand the chemical diversity of mRNA display libraries beyond the 20 canonical amino acids, including genetic code reprogramming and biorthogonal chemistries. To date, however, there have been few reports using enzymes as biocompatible reagents for diversifying mRNA display libraries. Here, we report the evaluation and implementation of the common industrial enzyme, microbial transglutaminase (mTG), as a versatile biocatalyst for cyclization of mRNA display peptide libraries via lysine-to-glutamine isopeptide bonds. We establish two separate display-based assays to validate the compatibility of mTG with mRNA-linked peptide substrates. These assays indicate that mTG has a high degree of substrate tolerance and low single round bias. To demonstrate the potential benefits of mTG-mediated cyclization in ligand discovery, high diversity mTG-modified libraries were employed in two separate affinity selections: (1) one against the calcium and integrin binding protein, CIB1, and (2) the second against the immune checkpoint protein and emerging therapeutic target, B7-H3. Both selections resulted in the identification of potent, cyclic, low nanomolar binders, and subsequent structure-activity studies demonstrate the importance of the cyclization to the observed activity. Notably, cyclization in the CIB1 binder stabilizes an α-helical conformation, while the B7-H3 inhibitor employs two bridges, one mTG-derived lactam and a second disulfide to achieve its potency. Together, these results demonstrate potential benefits of enzyme-based biocatalysts in mRNA display ligand selections and establish a framework for employing mTG in mRNA display.",2022-12-09

36462597,"Oxineur, a novel peptide from Caspian cobra Naja naja oxiana against HT-29 colon cancer.","Colon cancer ranks fourth in mortality. This cancer is still an important clinical challenge worldwide due to its high prevalence and poor prognosis. Proteomic studies revealed that snake venom is a diverse and variable mixture of enzymatic and non-enzymatic proteins and peptides. Despite the toxic effects of these molecules, several proteins and peptides have been isolated that have practical applications and appear to induce apoptosis and prevent cell metastasis. In this study, we worked on cytotoxic effects and anticancer activity of Naja naja oxiana (Iranian Caspian cobra) snake venom components on HT-29 cell line colon cancer. Separated Fraction-5 by FPLC indicated the high cytotoxicity on HT-29 cell line colon cancer by MTT test. Further isolation of F5 by HPLC showed that the purified peak 2, nominated as Oxineur that contains a cytotoxic effect on HT-29 cells and reduces cell viability at 8 μg/ml to 4% in 24 h. Oxineur has the least cytotoxic effect on HEK-293 normal cells. Further studies on Oxineur peptide confirmed the apoptotic effects with high expression of CASP9 gene and DNA fragmentation in cancerous cells. The partial sequence of Oxineur revealed 71% homology with the neurotoxin II from Naja naja oxiana.

36456600,Identification of a novel peptide ligand for the cancer-specific receptor mutation EGFRvIII using high-throughput sequencing of phage-selected peptides.,"We report here the selection and characterization of a novel peptide ligand using phage display targeted against the cancer-specific epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor mutation variant III (EGFRvIII). This receptor is expressed in several kinds of cancer: ovarian cancer, breast cancer and glioblastoma, but not in normal tissues. A 12-mer random peptide library was screened against EGFRvIII. Phage-selected peptides were sequenced in high-throughput by next generation sequencing (NGS), and their diversity was studied to identify highly abundant clones expected to bind with the highest affinities to EGFRvIII. The enriched peptides were characterized and their binding capacity towards stable cell lines expressing EGFRvIII, EGFR wild type (EGFR WT), or a low endogenous level of EGFR WT was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. The best peptide candidate, VLGREEWSTSYW, was synthesized, and its binding specificity towards EGFRvIII was validated in vitro.

36455356,Rational design of novel nucleoside analogues reveals potent antiviral agents for EV71.,"Different viruses belonging to distinct viral families, such as enterovirus 71, rely on the host methyltransferase METTL3 for the completion of fundamental cytoplasmic stages of their life cycle. Modulation of the activity of this enzyme could therefore provide a broad-spectrum approach to interfere with viral infections caused by viruses that depend on its activity for the completion of their viral cycle. With the aim to identify antiviral therapeutics with this effect, a series of new nucleoside analogues was rationally designed to act as inhibitors of human METTL3, as a novel approach to interfere with a range of viral infections. Guided by molecular docking studies on the SAM binding pocket of the enzyme, 24 compounds were prepared following multiple-step synthetic protocols, and evaluated for their ability to interfere with the replication of different viruses in cell-based systems, and to directly inhibit the activity of METTL3. While different molecules displayed moderate inhibition of the human methyltransferase in vitro, multiple novel, potent and selective inhibitors of enterovirus 71 were identified.",2022-11-24

Although peptides are available for targeting ANXA2, none of these were initially selected to target this protein specifically. Here, we took ANXA2 as a molecular target for PAAD and employed the phage display technique to screen for a new ANXA2-targeted peptide. The resultant heptapeptide, YW7, was firstly labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to evaluate its selectivity in cellular uptake, and further with the near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye Cy7 to assess in vivo distribution in a mouse model bearing PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer xenografic tumors. We found that both FITC-YW7 and Cy7-YW7 probes showed significantly higher uptake in PANC-1 cells compared to the HPDE6-C7 pancreatic epithelium cells. Mice intravenously injected with Cy7-YW7 showed higher tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) (~ 2.7-fold) in tumor tissues compared to those injected with Cy7 alone.

Moreover, SDDVL-zinc chelate showed higher stability (p < 0.05) than ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and zinc gluconate under different processing conditions including most pasteurization conditions, heating at 100°C for 10-50 min, various pH values (8.0-10.0), treatment of glucose (4-8 g/100 g) or NaCl (1-4 g/100 g), and simulated gastrointestinal digestion. In addition, SDDVL-zinc chelate showed higher zinc transport capacity than ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and zinc gluconate in Caco-2 cells (p < 0.05). These results suggested that millet bran peptide had a positive effect on the gastrointestinal stability and bioavailability of Zn, and SDDVL-zinc chelate could be used as ingredient of zinc supplements. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The current study provided a practical method to identify peptides of excellent zinc-chelating capacity from millet bran protein hydrolysates. This study demonstrated that in silico prediction assisted with suitable database was a fast, practical, and economic way to evaluate the security and to analysis the physicochemical properties of novel peptides. Moreover, it provided an efficient method to assess the stability of peptide-zinc chelate under different food processing conditions, which was the theoretical basis for utilization of peptide as ingredient of zinc fortifications.",2022-11-29

36431240,Preclinical Evaluation of a Novel Small Molecule Inhibitor of LIM Kinases (LIMK) CEL_Amide in Philadelphia-Chromosome Positive (<i>BCR::ABL+</i>) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).,"Ph+ (<i>BCR::ABL+</i>) B-ALL was considered to be high risk, but recent advances in <i>BCR::ABL</i>-targeting TKIs has shown improved outcomes in combination with backbone chemotherapy. Nevertheless, new treatment strategies are needed, including approaches without chemotherapy for elderly patients. LIMK1/2 acts downstream from various signaling pathways, which modifies cytoskeleton dynamics via phosphorylation of cofilin. Upstream of LIMK1/2, ROCK is constitutively activated by <i>BCR::ABL</i>, and upon activation, ROCK leads to the phosphorylation of LIMK1/2, resulting in the inactivation of cofilin by its phosphorylation and subsequently abrogating its apoptosis-promoting activity. Here, we demonstrate the anti-leukemic effects of a novel LIMK1/2 inhibitor (LIMKi) CEL_Amide in vitro and in vivo for <i>BCR::ABL</i>-driven B-ALL. The IC50 value of CEL_Amide was ≤1000 nM in <i>BCR::ABL+</i> TOM-1 and BV-173 cells and induced dose-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in these cell lines. LIMK1/2 were expressed in <i>BCR::ABL+</i> cell lines and patient cells and LIMKi treatment decreased LIMK1 protein expression, whereas LIMK2 expression was unaffected. As expected, CEL_Amide exposure caused specific activating downstream dephosphorylation of cofilin in cell lines and primary cells. Combination experiments with CEL_Amide and <i>BCR::ABL</i> TKIs imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib were synergistic for the treatment of both TOM-1 and BV-173 cells. CDKN2A<sup>ko</sup>/<i>BCR::ABL1</i>+ B-ALL cells were transplanted in mice, which were treated with combinations of CEL_Amide and nilotinib or ponatinib, which significantly prolonged their survival. Altogether, the LIMKi CEL_Amide yields activity in Ph+ ALL models when combined with <i>BCR::ABL</i>-targeting TKIs, showing promising synergy that warrants further investigation.",2022-11-15
36421718,First Anti-Inflammatory Peptide AnmTX Sco 9a-1 from the Swimming Sea Anemone <i>Stomphia coccinea</i>.,"A novel peptide AnmTX Sco 9a-1 with the β-hairpin fold was isolated from the swimming sea anemone <i>Stomphia coccinea</i> (Actinostolidae family). The peptide consists of 28 amino acid residues, including modified hydroxyproline residue, and its measured molecular mass is 2960 Da. The peptide was not toxic on mice; however, it stimulated their exploratory motivation and active search behavior, and demonstrated an anti-anxiety effect. AnmTX Sco 9a-1 at doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg reduced the volume of edema during 24 h better than the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Diclofenac, at dose of 1 mg/kg in a model of acute local λ-carrageenan-induced inflammation. ELISA analysis of the animal's blood showed that peptide at a dose of 1 mg/kg reduced the content of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory mediator responsible in the edema development, up to the level of TNF-α in the intact group. Besides, AnmTX Sco 9a-1 demonstrated a significant analgesic effect on acute pain sensitivity in the carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia model at doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg. Activity of AnmTX Sco 9a-1 was shown not to be associated with modulation of nociceptive ASIC channels.",2022-11-17
36417966,"C781, a β-Arrestin Biased Antagonist at Protease-Activated Receptor-2 (PAR2), Displays in vivo Efficacy Against Protease-Induced Pain in Mice.","Given the limited options and often harmful side effects of current analgesics and the suffering caused by the opioid crisis, new classes of pain therapeutics are needed. Protease-activated receptors (PARs), particularly PAR2, are implicated in a variety of pathologies, including pain. Since the discovery of the role of PAR2 in pain, development of potent and specific antagonists has been slow. In this study, we describe the in vivo characterization of a novel small molecule/peptidomimetic hybrid compound, C781, as a β-arrestin-biased PAR2 antagonist. In vivo behavioral studies were done in mice using von Frey filaments and the Mouse Grimace Scale. Pharmacokinetic studies were done to assess pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship in vivo. We used both prevention and reversal paradigms with protease treatment to determine whether C781 could attenuate protease-evoked pain. C781 effectively prevented and reversed mechanical and spontaneous nociceptive behaviors in response to small molecule PAR2 agonists, mast cell activators, and neutrophil elastase. The ED<sub>50</sub> of C781 (intraperitoneal dosing) for inhibition of PAR2 agonist (20.9 ng 2-AT)-evoked nociception was 6.3 mg/kg. C781 was not efficacious in the carrageenan inflammation model. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated limited long-term systemic bioavailability for C781 suggesting that optimizing pharmacokinetic properties could improve in vivo efficacy. Our work demonstrates in vivo efficacy of a biased PAR2 antagonist that selectively inhibits β-arrestin/MAPK signaling downstream of PAR2. Given the importance of this signaling pathway in PAR2-evoked nociception, C781 exemplifies a key pharmacophore for PAR2 that can be optimized for clinical development. PERSPECTIVE: Our work provides evidence that PAR2 antagonists that only block certain aspects of signaling by the receptor can be effective for blocking protease-evoked pain in mice. This is important because it creates a rationale for developing safer PAR2-targeting approaches for pain treatment.",2022-11-20

36400857,Construction and validation of a prognostic model for lung adenocarcinoma based on endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes.,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most universal types of cancer all over the world and its morbidity continues to rise year by year. Growing evidence has demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum stress is highly activated in cancer cells and plays a key role in regulating the fate of cancer cells. However, the role and mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress in lung adenocarcinoma genesis and development remains unclear. In this research, we developed a prognostic model to predict the overall survival of patients with LUAD utilizing endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes and screened out potential small molecular compounds, which could assist the clinician in making accurate decisions and better treat LUAD patients. Firstly, we downloaded 419 endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes (ERSRGs) from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Secondly, we obtained information about the transcriptome profiling and corresponding clinical data of 59 normal samples and 535 lung adenocarcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Next, we used the DESeq2 package to identify differentially expressed genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress. We performed univariate Cox, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate Cox regression analysis to establish a prognostic model for LUAD patients based on ERSRGs. Then, we carried out univariate and multivariate independent prognostic analysis of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related gene (ERSRG) score and some clinical traits of lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, we developed a clinically applicable nomogram for predicting survival for LUAD patients over one, three, and five years. Moreover, we carried out a drug sensitivity analysis to identify novel small molecule compounds for LUAD treatment. Finally, we examined the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune cell infiltrating analysis to explore the interactions between immune and cancer cells. 142 differentially expressed ERSRGs were identified by using the DESeq2 package. A prognostic model was built based on 7 differentially expressed ERSRGs after performing univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate Cox regression analysis. According to the results of univariate and multivariate independent prognostic analysis, we found ERSRG score can be used as an independent prognostic maker. Using the Kaplan-Meier curves, we found low-risk patients had higher survival probability than high-risk patients in both training set and test set. A nomogram was drawn to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival probability. The calibration curves explained good performance of the model for the prediction of survival. Phenformin, OSU-03012, GSK-650394 and KIN001-135 were identified as the drugs most likely to provide important information to clinicians about the treatment of LUAD patients. A prognostic prediction model was established based on 7 differentially expressed ERSRGs (PDX1, IGFBP1, DDIT4, PPP1R3G, CFTR, DERL3 and NUPR1), which could effectively predict the prognosis of LUAD patients and give a reference for clinical doctors to help LUAD patients to make better treatment tactics. Based on the 4 small molecule compounds (Phenformin, OSU-03012, GSK-650394 and KIN001-135) we discovered, targeting endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes may also be a therapeutic approach for LUAD patients.",2022-11-18

36395681,"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation studies of novel anti-fibrosis agents bearing sulfoxide moiety.","Fibrosis, a chronic disease with high morbidity and mortality, is mainly characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). At present, pathogenesis of fibrosis is incompletely understood, and there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective drugs. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of novel small-molecule compounds through structural modification and fragment hybridization. Among them, a potential anti-fibrosis drug compd.1 was founded to be able to dose-dependently down-regulate ACTA2 and CTGF mRNA levels in human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2) treated with TGF-β. In addition, compd.1 significantly improved the bridging fibrosis and collagen content in the CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrosis mice model. Moreover, compd.1 reduced lung inflammation and fibrotic area in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice model. These findings suggested that compd.1 is a promising candidate for further anti-fibrosis researches, and extended chemical space might help us to explore better anti-fibrosis drug.",2022-11-12
36387404,Treatment of multiple synchronous canine mast cell tumours using intratumoural tigilanol tiglate.,"Mast cell tumours (MCTs) are common canine skin neoplasia. While they generally occur as single tumours, multiple synchronous MCTs (msMCTs) of <i>de novo</i>/non-metastatic origin are reported in a proportion of the patient population. Where there is no evidence of metastasis or lymphatic spread, MCTs are effectively controlled by surgery and other local therapies. However, treatment of <i>de novo</i> msMCTs can be more challenging, especially when they occur in surgically difficult locations. Here, we report the use of tigilanol tiglate, a novel small molecule registered as a veterinary pharmaceutical for the local treatment of non-metastatic MCTs, in the treatment of patients with msMCTs presenting at three Australian specialist referral centres. We also present a meta-analysis of the literature to provide a better understanding of the prevalence of canine msMCTs. Notably, nine patients with a total of 32 MCTs were treated during the study. A complete response was recorded in 26 (81%) of the individual MCTs on Day 28 after a single tigilanol tiglate injection. Of the 6 initially non-responsive MCTs, one achieved a complete response after a further tigilanol tiglate treatment. A complete response was reported at 6 months in all 22 of the tumours that were evaluable and that had recorded a complete response at Day 84. For the literature meta-analysis, 22 studies were found with prevalence estimates of msMCTs ranging from 3 to 40%; when combined, these studies yielded 3,745 patients with a prevalence of 13% (95% CI 10; 16). Overall, the results demonstrate the utility of intratumoural tigilanol tiglate as an option for the treatment of multiple MCTs where multiple surgical resections would have been required.",2022-10-26
36386148,Wnt-pathway inhibitors with selective activity against triple-negative breast cancer: From thienopyrimidine to quinazoline inhibitors.,"The Wnt-pathway has a critical role in development and tissue homeostasis and has attracted increased attention to develop anticancer drugs due to its aberrant activation in many cancers. In this study, we identified a novel small molecule series with a thienopyrimidine scaffold acting as a downstream inhibitor of the β-catenin-dependent Wnt-pathway. This novel chemotype was investigated using Wnt-dependent triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Structure activity relationship (SAR) exploration led to identification of low micromolar compounds such as <b>5a</b>, <b>5d</b>, <b>5e</b> and a novel series with quinazoline scaffold such as <b>9d</b>. Further investigation showed translation of activity to inhibit cancer survival of HCC1395 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines without affecting a non-cancerous breast epithelial cell line MCF10a. This anti-proliferative effect was synergistic to docetaxel treatment. Collectively, we identified novel chemotypes acting as a downstream inhibitor of β-catenin-dependent Wnt-pathway that could expand therapeutic options to manage TNBC.",2022-10-28
36381330,The cancer stemness inhibitor napabucasin suppresses small cell lung cancer growth through SOX2 expression.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a high-grade malignancy of neuroendocrine origin characterized by aggressive cell growth and a poor survival rate of patients. Currently, the treatment options for SCLC remain limited despite platinum-based chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy is effective for SCLC, but most patients eventually acquire drug resistance, which leads to treatment failure. Stemness-high cancer cells show characteristics of advanced tumorigenesis and metastasis and have high potential in promoting treatment resistance and disease relapse. Napabucasin (BBI608), a novel small-molecule drug targeting on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), was shown to suppress the progression and metastasis of stemness-high cancer stem cells in various cancers. Here, we demonstrated that napabucasin significantly decreased viability and colony formation and induced the arrest of S-phase cell cycle and apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant SCLC cells. Findings from mechanistic studies further indicated that napabucasin directly downregulated the expression of SOX2 in cisplatin-resistant SCLC cells; however, dysfunctional SOX2 expression in SCLC cells was associated with interference in the napabucasin-mediated reduction of cell viability. In contrast, napabucasin-induced viability reduction was restored in these cells when SOX2 expression was upregulated. Furthermore, napabucasin significantly inhibited cisplatin-resistant SCLC cell xenograft growth <i>in vivo</i> by downregulating SOX2 and inducing apoptosis. These data demonstrate that napabucasin may be a novel drug for the clinical treatment of cisplatin-resistant SCLC.",2022-10-15
36380932,Nanotechnology meets immunology towards a rapid diagnosis solution: the COVID-19 outbreak challenge.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic presents one of the greatest challenges in human history. There is a consensus that the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 directly affects procedures to avoid dissemination, promote treatments, and favor the prognosis of infected patients. This interdisciplinary study aims at designing new synthetic peptides inspired by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2S) to produce rapid detection tests relying on nanomaterial-based colorimetric properties. Hence, <i>in silico</i> analyses of SARS-CoV-2S were performed using advanced bioinformatic simulation tools and algorithms. Five novel peptide sequences were proposed, and three were selected (P2, J4, and J5) based on their prospective reactivity against positive serum from naturally COVID-19-infected humans. Next, hyperimmune sera against the selected peptides were produced in rabbits. Concurrently, gold nanoparticles (AuNP) were synthesized using a green aqueous method under mild conditions through <i>in situ</i> reduction by trisodium citrate salt. They were extensively characterized by their morphological, physicochemical, and optical properties. The AuNPs demonstrated colloidal chemical stability in aqueous media, with an average size of approximately 29 nm (metallic core), and zeta potential before and after bioconjugation of -43 mV and -31 mV, respectively. Moreover, they presented an intense reddish-bluish color due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, with maxima at <i>λ</i> = 525 nm and 536 nm, before and after bioconjugation, respectively, evidencing their applicability as colorimetric biomarkers for antigen-antibody immunoassay detection. To develop a rapid COVID-19 diagnosis test using lateral flow assay (LFA), semi-purified anti-SARS-CoV-2S sera against the three selected peptides were bioconjugated to the AuNPs as the highly optically sensitive agents using a considerably low antibody concentration (0.2 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>). All tested peptide sequences (P2, J4, and J5) induced antibodies capable of identifying the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus inactivate suspensions (1 : 10, 1 : 100, or 1 : 1000 dilutions). For LFA positive test control, an anti-rabbit antibody was used. In summary, this research comprises several contributions and advances to the broad and multidisciplinary field of nanomaterials-based immunodiagnosis tools, encompassing: (a) the novelty of designing and synthesizing new immunogenic peptides inspired by SARS-CoV-2 virus epitopes using <i>in silico</i> bioinformatics; (b) the peptides induced the immune response in rabbit animal model producing hyperimmune serum; (c) the semi-purified hyperimmune serum rendered effective antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in cell suspension; (d) colloidal gold nanoparticles were produced and bioconjugated to the antibodies for qualitative colorimetric detection. As the overall result of this study, it was designed, developed, produced, and validated a new simple, rapid, and sensitive LFA diagnostic test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using a nanotechnology-based qualitative colorimetric assay, which can be envisioned as promising nanoplatforms for detecting other diseases.",2022-11-04

36337665,<i>In vitro</i> inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity by yellow field pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) protein-derived peptides as revealed by kinetics and molecular docking.,"Compounds with structural similarities to the neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) are mostly used to inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. However, the existing drugs only alleviate symptoms of moderate to mild conditions and come with side effects; hence, the search is still on for potent and safer options. In this study, High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionations of AChE-inhibitory pea protein hydrolysates obtained from alcalase, flavourzyme and pepsin digestions were carried out followed by sequence identification of the most active fractions using mass spectrometry. Subsequently, 20 novel peptide sequences identified from the active fractions were synthesized and five peptides, QSQS, LQHNA, SQSRS, ETRSQ, PQDER (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.53 - 1.61 μg/mL) were selected and analyzed for ability to change AChE protein conformation (fluorescence emission and circular dichroism), kinetics of enzyme inhibition, and enzyme-ligand binding configurations using molecular docking. The kinetics studies revealed different inhibition modes by the peptides with relatively low (<0.02 mM and <0.1 mM) inhibition constant and Michaelis constant, respectively, while maximum velocity was reduced. Conformational changes were confirmed by losses in fluorescence intensity and reduced α-helix content of AChE after interactions with different peptides. Molecular docking revealed binding of the peptides to both the catalytic anionic site and the peripheral anionic site. The five analyzed peptides all contained glutamine (Q) but sequences with Q in the penultimate N-terminal position (LQHNA, SQSRS, and PQDER) had stronger binding affinity. Results from the different analysis in this study confirm that the peptides obtained from enzymatic digestion of pea protein possess the potential to be used as novel AChE-inhibitory agents in AD management.",2022-10-21
36335744,CSF1R inhibitors are emerging immunotherapeutic drugs for cancer treatment.,"Colony-Stimulating Factor-1 Receptor (CSF1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that controls the differentiation and maintenance of most tissue-resident macrophages and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Mutations of CSF1R have been implicated in neurodegeneration, skeletal anomalies, and cancers. Activation of CSF1R by endogenous cytokine ligation to the ectodomain triggers the autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and thereafter, activation of several downstream pro-survival kinase cascades, including PI3K, ERK1/2, and JNK. The immunological role of CSF1R in regulating tumor-associate macrophages (TAMs) have been well-documented. TAMs harboring activated CSF1R release tumorigenic cytokines, which further deconditioning tumor microenvironment to a protumoral phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R has emerged as a promising antitumor strategy, with PLX3397 (pexidartinib) been approved by the FDA for the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumor in 2019. Research around developing novel small-molecule CSF1R inhibitors, as well as expanding their potential indications, have drawn numerous attentions thenceforward.

As BCL6 deregulation is implicated in the development of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, we sought to discover novel small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the BCL6-corepressor protein-protein interaction (PPI). Here we report our hit finding and compound optimisation strategies, which provide insight into the multi-faceted orthogonal approaches that are needed to tackle this challenging PPI with small molecule inhibitors. Using a 1536-well plate fluorescence polarisation high throughput screen we identified multiple hit series, which were followed up by hit confirmation using a thermal shift assay, surface plasmon resonance and ligand-observed NMR. We determined X-ray structures of BCL6 bound to compounds from nine different series, enabling a structure-based drug design approach to improve their weak biochemical potency. We developed a time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer biochemical assay and a nano bioluminescence resonance energy transfer cellular assay to monitor cellular activity during compound optimisation.

36325389,A new small molecule DHODH-inhibitor [KIO-100 (PP-001)] targeting activated T cells for intraocular treatment of uveitis - A phase I clinical trial.,"Uveitis is a T cell-mediated, intraocular inflammatory disease and one of the main causes of blindness in industrialized countries. There is a high unmet need for new immunomodulatory, steroid-sparing therapies, since only ciclosporin A and a single TNF-α-blocker are approved for non-infectious uveitis. A new small molecule inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme pivotal for <i>de novo</i> synthesis of pyrimidines, has a high potency for suppressing T and B cells and has already proven highly effective for treating uveitis in experimental rat models. Systemic and intraocular application of KIO-100 (PP-001) (previously called PP-001, now KIO-100) could efficiently suppress rat uveitis in a preventive as well as therapeutic mode. Here we describe the outcome of the first clinical phase 1 trial comparing three different doses of a single intraocular injection of KIO-100 (PP-001) in patients with non-infectious posterior segment uveitis. No toxic side effects on intraocular tissues or other adverse events were observed, while intraocular inflammation decreased, and visual acuity significantly improved. Macular edema, a sight-threatening complication in uveitis, showed regression 2 weeks after intraocular KIO-100 (PP-001) injection in some patients, indicating that this novel small molecule has a high potential as a new intraocular therapy for uveitis.",2022-10-17

36312923,Mirror proteases of Ac-Trypsin and Ac-LysargiNase precisely improve novel event identifications in <i>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</i> MC<sup>2</sup> 155 by proteogenomic analysis.,"Accurate identification of novel peptides remains challenging because of the lack of evaluation criteria in large-scale proteogenomic studies. Mirror proteases of trypsin and lysargiNase can generate complementary <i>b</i>/<i>y</i> ion series, providing the opportunity to efficiently assess authentic novel peptides in experiments other than filter potential targets by different false discovery rates (FDRs) ranking. In this study, a pair of in-house developed acetylated mirror proteases, Ac-Trypsin and Ac-LysargiNase, were used in <i>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</i> MC<sup>2</sup> 155 for proteogenomic analysis. The mirror proteases accurately identified 368 novel peptides, exhibiting 75-80% <i>b</i> and <i>y</i> ion coverages against 65-68% <i>y</i> or <i>b</i> ion coverages of Ac-Trypsin (38.9% <i>b</i> and 68.3% <i>y</i>) or Ac-LysargiNase (65.5% <i>b</i> and 39.6% <i>y</i>) as annotated peptides from <i>M. smegmatis</i> MC<sup>2</sup> 155. The complementary <i>b</i> and <i>y</i> ion series largely increased the reliability of overlapped sequences derived from novel peptides. Among these novel peptides, 311 peptides were annotated in other public <i>M. smegmatis</i> strains, and 57 novel peptides with more continuous <i>b</i> and <i>y</i> pairs were obtained for further analysis after spectral quality assessment. This enabled mirror proteases to successfully correct six annotated proteins' N-termini and detect 17 new coding open reading frames (ORFs).

36300526,Identification of novel peptide inhibitors for the KRas-G12C variant to prevent oncogenic signaling.,"Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRas) activating mutations are common in solid tumors, accounting for 90%, 45%, and 35% of pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers (LC), respectively. Each year, nearly 150k new cases (both men and women) of KRas-mutated malignancies are reported in the United States. NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) accounts for 80% of all LC cases. KRas mutations are found in 15% to 25% of NSCLC patients. The main cause of NSCLC is the KRas-G12C mutation. The drugs Sotorasib and Adagrasib were recently developed to treat advanced NSCLC caused by the KRas-G12C mutation. Most patients do not respond to KRas-G12C inhibitors due to cellular, molecular, and genetic resistance. Because of their safety, efficacy, and selectivity, peptide inhibitors have the potential to treat newly developing KRas mutations. Based on the KRas mutations, peptide inhibitors that are highly selective and specific to individual lung cancers can be rationally designed. The current study uses an alanine and residue scanning approach to design peptide inhibitors for KRas-G12C based on the known peptide. Our findings show that substitution of F3K, G11T, L8C, T14C, K13D, G11S, and G11P considerably enhances the binding affinity of the novel peptides, whereas F3K, G11T, L8C, and T14C peptides have higher stability and favorable binding to the altered peptides. Overall, our study paves the road for the development of potential therapeutic peptidomimetics that target the KRas-G12C complex and may inhibit the KRas and SOS complex from interacting.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

36298835,The Novel <i>h</i>DHODH Inhibitor MEDS433 Prevents Influenza Virus Replication by Blocking Pyrimidine Biosynthesis.,"The pharmacological management of influenza virus (IV) infections still poses a series of challenges due to the limited anti-IV drug arsenal. Therefore, the development of new anti-influenza agents effective against antigenically different IVs is therefore an urgent priority. To meet this need, host-targeting antivirals (HTAs) can be evaluated as an alternative or complementary approach to current direct-acting agents (DAAs) for the therapy of IV infections. As a contribution to this antiviral strategy, in this study, we characterized the anti-IV activity of MEDS433, a novel small molecule inhibitor of the human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (<i>h</i>DHODH), a key cellular enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. MEDS433 exhibited a potent antiviral activity against IAV and IBV replication, which was reversed by the addition of exogenous uridine and cytidine or the <i>h</i>DHODH product orotate, thus indicating that MEDS433 targets notably <i>h</i>DHODH activity in IV-infected cells. When MEDS433 was used in combination either with dipyridamole (DPY), an inhibitor of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, or with an anti-IV DAA, such as N<sup>4</sup>-hydroxycytidine (NHC), synergistic anti-IV activities were observed. As a whole, these results indicate MEDS433 as a potential HTA candidate to develop novel anti-IV intervention approaches, either as a single agent or in combination regimens with DAAs.",2022-10-17
36297673,A ROR1 Small Molecule Inhibitor (KAN0441571C) Induced Significant Apoptosis of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) Cells.,"The receptor tyrosine kinase orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is absent in most normal adult tissues but overexpressed in various malignancies and is of importance for tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. In this study, we evaluated the apoptotic effects of a novel small molecule inhibitor of ROR1 (KAN0441571C) as well as venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor), bendamustine, idelalisib (PI3Kδ inhibitor), everolimus (mTOR inhibitor), and ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor) alone or in combination in human MCL primary cells and cell lines. ROR1 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry and Western blot (WB). Cytotoxicity was analyzed by MTT and apoptosis by Annexin V/PI staining as well as signaling and apoptotic proteins (WB). ROR1 was expressed both in patient-derived MCL cells and human MCL cell lines. KAN0441571C alone induced significant time- and dose-dependent apoptosis of MCL cells. Apoptosis was accompanied by decreased expression of MCL-1 and BCL-2 and cleavage of PARP and caspase 3. ROR1 was dephosphorylated as well as ROR1-associated signaling pathway molecules, including the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway (PI3Kδ/AKT/mTOR). The combination of KAN0441571C and ibrutinib, venetoclax, idelalisib, everolimus, or bendamustine had a synergistic apoptotic effect and significantly prevented phosphorylation of ROR1-associated signaling molecules as compared to KAN0441571C alone. Our results suggest that targeting ROR1 by a small molecule inhibitor, KAN0441571C, should be further evaluated particularly in combination with other targeting drugs as a new therapeutic approach for MCL.",2022-10-20
36297523,The Novel Peptide Chm-273s Has Therapeutic Potential for Metabolic Disorders: Evidence from In Vitro Studies and High-Sucrose Diet and High-Fat Diet Rodent Models.,"The aim of this study was to develop a novel peptide potentially applicable for the treatment of metabolic conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We identified CHM-273S from the list of peptides from milk hydrolysate obtained by HPLC/MS-MS. In vitro analysis of primary murine fibroblasts indicated the potential of CHM-273S to upregulate IRS2 mRNA expression. CHM-273S showed a prominent anorexigenic effect in mice with the induction of a key mechanism of leptin signaling via STAT3 in the hypothalamus as a possible effector. In the animal model of metabolic disease, CHM-273S alleviated glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and Thr308 in the hepatocytes of high-sucrose diet-fed rats. In a murine model of T2D, CHM-273S mitigated high-fat diet-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance and improved low-grade inflammation by diminishing serum TNFα. Mice treated with chronic CHM-273S had a significant reduction in body weight, with a lower visceral fat pad weight and narrow adipocytes. The effects of the peptide administration were comparable to those of metformin. We show the potential of CHM-273S to alleviate diet-induced metabolic alterations in rodents, substantiating its further development as a therapeutic for obesity, T2D, and other metabolic conditions.",2022-09-30
36291138,Research Progress on the Role of Pyroptosis in Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) results in the aggravation of myocardial injury caused by rapid recanalization of the ischemic myocardium. In the past few years, there is a growing interest in investigating the complex pathophysiological mechanism of MIRI for the identification of effective targets and drugs to alleviate MIRI. Currently, pyroptosis, a type of inflammatory programmed death, has received greater attention. It is involved in the MIRI development in combination with other mechanisms of MIRI, such as oxidative stress, calcium overload, necroptosis, and apoptosis, thereby forming an intertwined association between different pathways that affect MIRI by regulating common pathway molecules. This review describes the pyroptosis mechanism in MIRI and its relationship with other mechanisms, and also highlights non-coding RNAs and non-cardiomyocytes as regulators of cardiomyocyte pyroptosis by mediating associated pathways or proteins to participate in the initiation and development of MIRI. The research progress on novel small molecule drugs, clinical drugs, traditional Chinese medicine, etc. for regulating pyroptosis can play a crucial role in effective MIRI alleviation. When compared to research on other mature mechanisms, the research studies on pyroptosis in MIRI are inadequate. Although many related protective drugs have been identified, these drugs generally lack clinical applications. It is necessary to further explore and verify these drugs to expand their applications in clinical setting. Early inhibition of MIRI by targeted regulation of pyroptosis is a key concern that needs to be addressed in future studies.",2022-10-18
36290108,Recent Progress in the Discovery and Design of Antimicrobial Peptides Using Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning.,"Antimicrobial resistance has become a critical global health problem due to the abuse of conventional antibiotics and the rise of multi-drug-resistant microbes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a group of natural peptides that show promise as next-generation antibiotics due to their low toxicity to the host, broad spectrum of biological activity, including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-parasitic activities, and great therapeutic potential, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, etc. Most importantly, AMPs kill bacteria by damaging cell membranes using multiple mechanisms of action rather than targeting a single molecule or pathway, making it difficult for bacterial drug resistance to develop. However, experimental approaches used to discover and design new AMPs are very expensive and time-consuming. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in using in silico methods, including traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches, to drug discovery. While there are a few papers summarizing computational AMP prediction methods, none of them focused on DL methods. In this review, we aim to survey the latest AMP prediction methods achieved by DL approaches. First, the biology background of AMP is introduced, then various feature encoding methods used to represent the features of peptide sequences are presented. We explain the most popular DL techniques and highlight the recent works based on them to classify AMPs and design novel peptide sequences. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of AMP prediction.",2022-10-21
36279366,Structure-Based Discovery of a Novel Class of Small-Molecule Pure Antagonists of Integrin αVβ3.,"Inhibitors of integrin αVβ3 have therapeutic promise for a variety of diseases. Most αVβ3-targeting small molecules patterned after the RGD motif are partial agonists because they induce a high-affinity, ligand-binding conformation and prime the receptor to bind the ligand without an activating stimulus, in part <i>via</i> a charge-charge interaction between their aspartic acid carboxyl group and the metal ion in the metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). Building upon our previous studies on the related integrin αIIbβ3, we searched for pure αVβ3 antagonists that lack this typical aspartic acid carboxyl group and instead engage through direct binding to one of the coordinating residues of the MIDAS metal ion, specifically β3 E220. By <i>in silico</i> screening of two large chemical libraries for compounds interacting with β3 E220, we indeed discovered a novel molecule that does not contain an acidic carboxyl group and does not induce the high-affinity, ligand-binding state of the receptor. Functional and structural characterization of a chemically optimized version of this compound led to the discovery of a novel small-molecule pure αVβ3 antagonist that (i) does not prime the receptor to bind the ligand and does not induce hybrid domain swing-out or receptor extension as judged by antibody binding and negative-stain electron microscopy, (ii) binds at the RGD-binding site as predicted by metadynamics rescoring of induced-fit docking poses and confirmed by a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the compound-bound integrin, and (iii) coordinates the MIDAS metal ion <i>via</i> a quinoline moiety instead of an acidic carboxyl group.",2022-10-24
36268125,Discovery of Novel Small-Molecule Scaffolds for the Inhibition and Activation of WIP1 Phosphatase from a RapidFire Mass Spectrometry High-Throughput Screen.,"Wild-type P53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1), also known as <i>PPM1D</i> or PP2Cδ, is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase induced by P53 after genotoxic stress. WIP1 inhibition has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for P53 wild-type cancers in which it is overexpressed, but this approach would be ineffective in P53-negative cancers. Furthermore, there are several cancers with mutated P53 where WIP1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Therefore, activating WIP1 phosphatase might also be a therapeutic strategy, depending on the P53 status. To date, no specific, potent WIP1 inhibitors with appropriate pharmacokinetic properties have been reported, nor have WIP1-specific activators. Here, we report the discovery of new WIP1 modulators from a high-throughput screen (HTS) using previously described orthogonal biochemical assays suitable for identifying both inhibitors and activators. The primary HTS was performed against a library of 102 277 compounds at a single concentration using a RapidFire mass spectrometry assay. Hits were further evaluated over a range of 11 concentrations with both the RapidFire MS assay and an orthogonal fluorescence-based assay. Further biophysical, biochemical, and cell-based studies of confirmed hits revealed a WIP1 activator and two inhibitors, one competitive and one uncompetitive. These new scaffolds are prime candidates for optimization which might enable inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetics and a first-in-class WIP1 activator.",2022-09-28
36263926,Small Molecule Inhibitors of Lymphocyte Perforin as Focused Immunosuppressants for Infection and Autoimmunity.,"New drugs that precisely target the immune mechanisms critical for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cell driven pathologies are desperately needed. In this perspective, we explore the cytolytic protein perforin as a target for therapeutic intervention. Perforin plays an indispensable role in CTL/NK killing and controls a range of immune pathologies, while being encoded by a single copy gene with no redundancy of function. An immunosuppressant targeting this protein would provide the first-ever therapy focused specifically on one of the principal cell death pathways contributing to allotransplant rejection and underpinning multiple autoimmune and postinfectious diseases. No drugs that selectively block perforin-dependent cell death are currently in clinical use, so this perspective will review published novel small molecule inhibitors, concluding with <i>in vivo</i> proof-of-concept experiments performed in mouse models of perforin-mediated immune pathologies that provide a potential pathway toward a clinically useful therapeutic agent.",2022-10-20
36262387,Design and Characterization of Novel Small Molecule Activators of Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2.,"Excitotoxicity in the brain is a causal factor in several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), an astrocytic glutamate transporter involved in the clearance of >80% of synaptic glutamate, is considered a therapeutically relevant target for excitotoxicity. We have previously designed GT951, an activator of EAAT2 with nanomolar efficacy but limited in vivo bioavailability. In this study, a pharmacophore-based screening and optimization resulted in the design of GTS467 and GTS511. GTS467 and GTS511 have low nanomolar efficacy in the glutamate uptake assay. Pharmacokinetic profiles (PK) of GTS511 show a >6 h half-life and higher bioavailability in plasma and the brain under all three routes of administration in rats. Similarly, GTS467 has high oral bioavailability (80-85%) in the brain and plasma with a >1 h half-life under all three dosing routes. These encouraging efficacy and PK profiles suggest that GTS511 and GTS467 can be further developed to treat neurological disorders caused by excitotoxicity.",2022-09-19
36258023,Development of a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant formulation to overcome early life hyporesponsiveness to DTaP vaccination.,"Infection is the most common cause of mortality early in life, yet the broad potential of immunization is not fully realized in this vulnerable population. Most vaccines are administered during infancy and childhood, but in some cases the full benefit of vaccination is not realized in-part. New adjuvants are cardinal to further optimize current immunization approaches for early life. However, only a few classes of adjuvants are presently incorporated in vaccines approved for human use. Recent advances in the discovery and delivery of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist adjuvants have provided a new toolbox for vaccinologists. Prominent among these candidate adjuvants are synthetic small molecule TLR7/8 agonists. The development of an effective infant Bordetella pertussis vaccine is urgently required because of the resurgence of pertussis in many countries, contemporaneous to the switch from whole cell to acellular vaccines. In this context, TLR7/8 adjuvant based vaccine formulation strategies may be a promising tool to enhance and accelerate early life immunity by acellular B. pertussis vaccines. In the present study, we optimized (a) the formulation delivery system, (b) structure, and (c) immunologic activity of novel small molecule imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 adjuvants towards human infant leukocytes, including dendritic cells. Upon immunization of neonatal mice, this TLR7/8 adjuvant overcame neonatal hyporesponsiveness to acellular pertussis vaccination by driving a T helper (Th)1/Th17 biased T cell- and IgG2c-skewed humoral response to a licensed acellular vaccine (DTaP). This potent immunization strategy may represent a new paradigm for effective immunization against pertussis and other pathogens in early life.",2022-10-18
36253322,A Small-Molecule Probe with a Dual Function of miRNA Inhibition and Target identification.,"By virtue of their key roles in pathologies, miRNAs represent a promising class of therapeutic targets. While high-fidelity small-molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified via high-throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small-molecule probe, 1 a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1 a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1 a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1 a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small-molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.",2022-11-28
36251573,Sebetralstat (KVD900): A Potent and Selective Small Molecule Plasma Kallikrein Inhibitor Featuring a Novel P1 Group as a Potential Oral On-Demand Treatment for Hereditary Angioedema.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder in which patients experience sudden onset of swelling in various locations of the body. HAE is associated with uncontrolled plasma kallikrein (PKa) enzyme activity and generation of the potent inflammatory mediator, bradykinin, resulting in episodic attacks of angioedema. Herein, we disclose the discovery and optimization of novel small molecule PKa inhibitors. Starting from molecules containing highly basic P1 groups, which typically bind to an aspartic acid residue (Asp189) in the serine protease S1 pocket, we identified novel P1 binding groups likely to have greater potential for oral-drug-like properties. The optimization of P4 and the central core together with the particularly favorable properties of 3-fluoro-4-methoxypyridine P1 led to the development of sebetralstat, a potent, selective, orally bioavailable PKa inhibitor in phase 3 for on-demand treatment of HAE attacks.",2022-10-17

36247303,Molecular interaction between small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G and heat shock protein 70.14: a microscale thermophoresis exposition towards developing anti-cancer drugs.,"Targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) linked to protein quality control (PQC) pathways as potential anti-cancer drug targets have unanimously widened biological insights and the therapeutic potential of PPIs as smart-drug discovery tools in cancer. PPIs between disease-relevant proteins associated with protein homeostasis in PQC pathways have been linked to improved mechanistic understanding associated with conformational abnormalities and impairment, cellular proteotoxicity, induced apoptosis, and pathogenesis in different types of cancers. In this context, PPIs between small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G (SNRPG) and heat shock protein 70.14 (Hsp70.14) have attracted attention as potential smart drug discovery tools in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. Validated evidence of high-quality biological data has shown the presence of the two proteins in different types of cancers including breast cancer. The links between SNRPG and Hsp70.14 in cancer-cell networks remain elusive, overlooked, and uncharacterized.",2022-09-15
36243802,A combination of novel NSC small molecule inhibitor along with doxorubicin inhibits proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer through metabolic reprogramming.,"Treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been challenging due to the absence of well-defined molecular targets and the highly invasive and proliferative nature of TNBC cells. Current treatments against TNBC have shown little promise due to high recurrence rate in patients. Consequently, there is a pressing need for novel and efficacious therapies against TNBC. Here, we report the discovery of a novel small molecule inhibitor (NSC33353) with potent anti-tumor activity against TNBC cells. The anti-proliferative effects of this small molecule inhibitor were determined using 2D and 3D cell proliferation assays. We found that NSC33353 significantly reduces the proliferation of TNBC cells in these assays. Using proteomics, next generation sequencing (NGS), and gene enrichment analysis, we investigated global regulatory pathways affected by this compound in TNBC cells. Proteomics data indicate a significant metabolic reprograming affecting both glycolytic enzymes and energy generation through oxidative phosphorylation. Subsequently, using metabolic (Seahorse) and enzymatic assays, we validated our proteomics and NGS analysis findings. Finally, we showed the inhibitory and anti-tumor effects of this small molecule in vitro and confirmed its inhibitory activity in vivo. Doxorubicin is one of the most effective agents in the treatment of TNBC and resistance to this drug has been a major problem. We show that the combination of NSC33353 and doxorubicin suppresses the growth of TNBC cells synergistically, suggesting that NSC33353 enhances TNBC sensitivity to doxorubicin. In summary, our data indicate that the small molecule inhibitor, NSC33353, exhibits anti-tumor activity in TNBC cells, and works in a synergistic fashion with a well-known chemotherapeutic agent.",2022-10-15
36234971,Using the Cyclotide Scaffold for Targeting Biomolecular Interactions in Drug Development.,"This review provides an overview of the properties of cyclotides and their potential for developing novel peptide-based therapeutics. The selective disruption of protein-protein interactions remains challenging, as the interacting surfaces are relatively large and flat. However, highly constrained polypeptide-based molecular frameworks with cell-permeability properties, such as the cyclotide scaffold, have shown great promise for targeting those biomolecular interactions. The use of molecular techniques, such as epitope grafting and molecular evolution employing the cyclotide scaffold, has shown to be highly effective for selecting bioactive cyclotides.",2022-09-29
36234744,A Selective Review and Virtual Screening Analysis of Natural Product Inhibitors of the NLRP3 Inflammasome.,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is currently an exciting target for drug discovery due to its role in various inflammatory diseases; however, to date, no NLRP3 inhibitors have reached the clinic. Several studies have used natural products as hit compounds to facilitate the design of novel selective NLRP3 inhibitors. Here, we review selected natural products reported in the literature as NLRP3 inhibitors, with a particular focus on those targeting gout. To complement this survey, we also report a virtual screen of the ZINC20 natural product database, predicting favored chemical features that can aid in the design of novel small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors.",2022-09-21
36233248,The Novel Small Molecule BTB Inhibits Pro-Fibrotic Fibroblast Behavior though Inhibition of RhoA Activity.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, chronic, interstitial lung disease with a poor prognosis. Although specific anti-fibrotic medications are now available, the median survival time following diagnosis remains very low, and new therapies are urgently needed. To uncover novel therapeutic targets, we examined how biochemical properties of the fibrotic lung are different from the healthy lung. Previous work identified lactate as a metabolite that is upregulated in IPF lung tissue. Importantly, inhibition of the enzyme responsible for lactate production prevents fibrosis in vivo. Further studies revealed that fibrotic lesions of the lung experience a significant decline in tissue pH, likely due to the overproduction of lactate. It is not entirely clear how cells in the lung respond to changes in extracellular pH, but a family of proton sensing G-protein coupled receptors has been shown to be activated by reductions in extracellular pH. This work examines the expression profiles of proton sensing GPCRs in non-fibrotic and IPF-derived primary human lung fibroblasts. We identify TDAG8 as a proton sensing GPCR that is upregulated in IPF fibroblasts and that knockdown of TDAG8 dampens myofibroblast differentiation. To our surprise, BTB, a proposed positive allosteric modulator of TDAG8, inhibits myofibroblast differentiation. Our data suggest that BTB does not require TDAG8 to inhibit myofibroblast differentiation, but rather inhibits myofibroblast differentiation through suppression of RhoA mediated signaling. Our work highlights the therapeutic potential of BTB as an anti-fibrotic treatment and expands upon the importance of RhoA-mediated signaling pathways in the context of myofibroblast differentiation. Furthermore, this works also suggests that TDAG8 inhibition may have therapeutic relevance in the treatment of IPF.",2022-10-08
36214844,Design of Xenopus GLP-1-Based Long-Acting Dual GLP-1/Y<sub>2</sub> Receptor Agonists.,"GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and neuropeptide Y<sub>2</sub> receptor (Y<sub>2</sub>R) dual agonists have shown great potential to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We developed a multitarget strategy to design monomeric agonists based on <i>Xenopus</i> GLP-1 (xGLP-1) and PYY<sub>3-36</sub> analogues with dual activation activities on GLP-1R and Y<sub>2</sub>R. A novel peptide, <b>6q</b>, was obtained via stepwise structure optimization and <i>in vitro</i> receptor screens. In <i>db</i>/<i>db</i> and diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice, <b>6q</b> produced greater effects on long-term glycemic control and body weight reduction than GLP-1R and Y<sub>2</sub>R monoagonist counterparts. Notably, in high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice, <b>6q</b> treatment significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol levels and reversed hepatic steatosis compared with GLP-1R monoagonist (liraglutide) treatment. Collectively, these data support the therapeutic potential of our GLP-1R/Y<sub>2</sub>R dual agonist <b>6q</b> as a novel antidiabetic, antiobesity, and antisteatotic agent.",2022-10-10
36212502,Drug resistance in multiple myeloma: Soldiers and weapons in the bone marrow niche.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is still an incurable disease, despite considerable improvements in treatment strategies, as resistance to most currently available agents is not uncommon. In this study, data on drug resistance in MM were analyzed and led to the following conclusions: resistance occurs <i>via</i> intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, including intraclonal heterogeneity, drug efflux pumps, alterations of drug targets, the inhibition of apoptosis, increased DNA repair and interactions with the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, cell adhesion, and the release of soluble factors. Since MM involves the BM, interactions in the MM-BM microenvironment were examined as well, with a focus on the cross-talk between BM stromal cells (BMSCs), adipocytes, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Given the complex mechanisms that drive MM, next-generation treatment strategies that avoid drug resistance must target both the neoplastic clone and its non-malignant environment. Possible approaches based on recent evidence include: (i) proteasome and histone deacetylases inhibitors that not only target MM but also act on BMSCs and osteoclasts; (ii) novel peptide drug conjugates that target both the MM malignant clone and angiogenesis to unleash an effective anti-MM immune response. Finally, the role of cancer stem cells in MM is unknown but given their roles in the development of solid and hematological malignancies, cancer relapse, and drug resistance, their identification and description are of paramount importance for MM management.",2022-09-21
36210834,A novel small molecule RK-019 inhibits <i>FGFR2</i>-amplification gastric cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most malignant cancers and is estimated to be fifth in incidence ratio and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Despite advances in GC treatment, poor prognosis and low survival rate necessitate the development of novel treatment options. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) have been suggested to be potential targets for GC treatment. In this study, we report a novel selective FGFR inhibitor, RK-019, with a pyrido [1, 2-a] pyrimidinone skeleton. <i>In vitro</i>, RK-019 showed excellent FGFR1-4 inhibitory activities and strong anti-proliferative effects against <i>FGFR2</i>-amplification (<i>FGFR2</i>-amp) GC cells, including SNU-16 and KATO III cells. Treatment with RK-019 suppressed phosphorylation of FGFR and its downstream pathway proteins, such as FRS2, PLCγ, AKT, and Erk, resulting in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, daily oral administration of RK-019 could attenuate tumor xenograft growth with no adverse effects. Here, we reported a novel specific FGFR inhibitor, RK-019, with potent anti-FGFR2-amp GC activity both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.",2022-09-21
36210051,Development and use of a high-throughput screen to identify novel modulators of the corticotropin releasing factor binding protein.,"Stress responses are believed to involve corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), its two cognate receptors (CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub>), and the CRF-binding protein (CRFBP). Whereas decades of research has focused on CRF<sub>1</sub>, the role of CRF<sub>2</sub> in the central nervous system (CNS) has not been thoroughly investigated. We have previously reported that CRF<sub>2</sub>, interacting with a C terminal fragment of CRFBP, CRFBP(10kD), may have a role in the modulation of neuronal activity. However, the mechanism by which CRF interacts with CRFBP(10kD) and CRF<sub>2</sub> has not been fully elucidated due to the lack of useful chemical tools to probe CRFBP.",2022-10-07
36206451,Discovery and Biological Characterization of PRMT5:MEP50 Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors.,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a master epigenetic regulator and an extensively validated therapeutic target in multiple cancers. Notably, PRMT5 is the only PRMT that requires an obligate cofactor, methylosome protein 50 (MEP50), to function. We developed compound <b>17</b>, a novel small-molecule PRMT5:MEP50 protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor, after initial virtual screen hit identification and analogue refinement. Molecular docking indicated that compound <b>17</b> targets PRMT5:MEP50 PPI by displacing the MEP50 W54 burial into a hydrophobic pocket of the PRMT5 TIM barrel. <i>In vitro</i> analysis indicates IC<sub>50</sub> < 500 nM for prostate and lung cancer cells with selective, specific inhibition of PRMT5:MEP50 substrate methylation and target gene expression, and RNA-seq analysis suggests that compound <b>17</b> may dysregulate TGF-β signaling. Compound <b>17</b> provides a proof of concept in targeting PRMT5:MEP50 PPI, as opposed to catalytic targeting, as a novel mechanism of action and supports further preclinical development of inhibitors in this class.",2022-10-07
36195187,"Anticancer peptides mechanisms, simple and complex.","Peptide therapy has started since 1920s with the advent of insulin application, and now it has emerged as a new approach in treatment of diseases including cancer. Using anti-cancer peptides (ACPs) is a promising way of cancer therapy as ACPs are continuing to be approved and arrived at major pharmaceutical markets. Traditional cancer treatments face different problems like intensive adverse effects to patient's body, cell resistance to conventional chemical drugs and in some worse cases the occurrence of cell multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancerous tissues against chemotherapy. On the other hand, there are some benefits conceived for peptides usage in treatment of diseases specifically cancer, as these compounds present favorable characteristics such as smaller size, high activity, low immunogenicity, good biocompatibility in vivo, convenient and rapid way of synthesis, amenable to sequence modification and revision and there is no limitation for the type of cargo they carry. It is possible to achieve an optimum molecular and functional structure of peptides based on previous experience and bank of peptide motif data which may result in novel peptide design. Bioactive peptides are able to form pores in cell membrane and induce necrosis or apoptosis of abnormal cells. Moreover, recent researches have focused on the tumor recognizing peptide motifs with the ability to permeate to cancerous cells with the aim of cancer treatment at earlier stages. In this strategy the most important factors for addressing cancer are choosing peptides with easy accessibility to tumor cell without cytotoxicity effect towards normal cells. The peptides must also meet acceptable pharmacokinetic requirements. In this review, the characteristics of peptides and cancer cells are discussed. The various mechanisms of peptides' action proposed against cancer cells make the next part of discussion. It will be followed by giving information on peptides application, various methods of peptide designing along with introducing various databases. Future aspects of peptides for employing in area of cancer treatment come as conclusion at the end.",2022-10-01
36185250,Chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT/TRiC) is a novel therapeutic and diagnostic target for neuroblastoma.,"Chaperonin containing TCP1 (CCT/TRiC) is a multi-subunit protein folding complex that enables the cancer phenotype to emerge from the mutational landscape that drives oncogenesis. We and others linked increased expression of CCT subunits to advanced tumor stage and invasiveness that inversely correlates with cancer patient outcomes. In this study, we examined the expression of the second CCT subunit, CCT2, using genomic databases of adult and pediatric tumors and normal tissues, and found that it was highly expressed in pediatric cancers, showing a significant difference compared to normal tissues. Histologic staining confirmed that CCT subunits are highly expressed in tumor tissues, which was exemplified in neuroblastoma. Using two neuroblastoma cells, MYCN-amplified, IMR-32 cells, and non-amplified, SK-N-AS cells, we assessed baseline levels for CCT subunits and found expressions comparable to the highly invasive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231. Exogenous expression of CCT2 in both SK-N-AS and IMR-32 cells resulted in morphological changes, such as larger cell size and increased adherence, with significant increases in the CCT substrates, actin, and tubulin, as well as increased migration. Depletion of CCT2 reversed these effects and reduced cell viability. We evaluated CCT as a therapeutic target in IMR-32 cells by testing a novel peptide CCT inhibitor, CT20p. Treatment with CT20p induced cell death in these neuroblastoma cells. The use of CCT2 as a biological indicator for detection of neuroblastoma cells shed in blood was examined by spiking IMR-32 cells into human blood and using an anti-CCT2 antibody for the identification of spiked cancer cells with the CellSearch system. Results showed that using CCT2 for the detection of neuroblastoma cells in blood was more effective than the conventional approach of using epithelial markers like cytokeratins. CCT2 plays an essential role in promoting the invasive capacity of neuroblastoma cells and thus offers the potential to act as a molecular target in the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostics for pediatric cancers.",2022-09-15
36184840,Discovery of Small Molecule Agonist of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor (GnRH1R).,"The gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a central regulator of the human reproductive system and exerts physiological effects by binding to GnRH1R. The GnRH-GnRH1R system is a promising therapeutic target for the maintenance of reproductive function. There are several GnRH1R agonists on the market, but like GnRH, they are all peptide compounds and are limited by their way of administration (subcutaneous or intramuscular injection). To date, no published GnRH1R small molecule agonists have been reported. In this paper, the HTRF-based screening method has been used to screen our in-house chemical library, and we found and confirmed <b>CD304</b> as a hit compound. Subsequently, structure optimization led to the discovery of compound <b>6d</b>, exhibited with a certain GnRH1R activation activity (EC<sub>50</sub>: 1.59 ± 0.38 μM). Further molecular dynamics simulation experiments showed that <b>6d</b> can well bind to the orthosteric site of GnRH1R through forming a hydrogen-bonding interaction with Y283<sup>6.51</sup>. Binding of <b>6d</b> further induces conformational changes in TM6 and TM7, promoting the formation of a continuous water channel in GnRH1R, thereby promoting GnRH1R activation. This well-characterized hit compound will facilitate the further development of novel small molecule agonists of GnRH1R.",2022-10-02

36163500,Computational identification of a systemic antibiotic for gram-negative bacteria.,"Discovery of antibiotics acting against Gram-negative species is uniquely challenging due to their restrictive penetration barrier. BamA, which inserts proteins into the outer membrane, is an attractive target due to its surface location. Darobactins produced by Photorhabdus, a nematode gut microbiome symbiont, target BamA. We reasoned that a computational search for genes only distantly related to the darobactin operon may lead to novel compounds. Following this clue, we identified dynobactin A, a novel peptide antibiotic from Photorhabdus australis containing two unlinked rings. Dynobactin is structurally unrelated to darobactins, but also targets BamA. Based on a BamA-dynobactin co-crystal structure and a BAM-complex-dynobactin cryo-EM structure, we show that dynobactin binds to the BamA lateral gate, uniquely protruding into its β-barrel lumen. Dynobactin showed efficacy in a mouse systemic Escherichia coli infection. This study demonstrates the utility of computational approaches to antibiotic discovery and suggests that dynobactin is a promising lead for drug development.",2022-09-26
36145329,"Synthesis, Neuroprotective Effect and Physicochemical Studies of Novel Peptide and Nootropic Analogues of Alzheimer Disease Drug.","Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. Excessive glutamate transmission can lead to increased calcium ion expression, related to increased neurotoxicity. Memantine is used for treating patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its protective action on the neurons against toxicity caused by over activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Nootropics, also called ""smart drugs"", are used for the treatment of cognitive deficits. In this work, we evaluate the neuroprotective action of four memantine analogues of glycine derivatives, including glycyl-glycine, glycyl-glycyl-glycine, sarcosine, dimethylglycine and three conjugates with nootropics, modafinil, piracetam and picamilon. The new structural memantine derivatives improved cell viability against copper-induced neurotoxicity in APPswe cells and glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Among these novel compounds, modafinil-memantine, piracetam-memantine, sarcosine-memantine, dimethylglycine-memantine, and glycyl-glycine-memantine were demonstrated with good EC<sub>50</sub> values of the protective effects on APPswe cells, accompanied with moderate amelioration from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that novel structural derivatives of memantine might have the potential to develop promising lead compounds for the treatment of AD. The solubility of memantine analogues with nootropics and memantine analogues with glycine derivatives in buffer solutions at pH 2.0 and pH 7.4 simulating the biological media at 298.15 K was determined and the mutual influence of the structural fragments in the molecules on the solubility behavior was analyzed. The significative correlation equations relating the solubility and biological properties with the structural HYBOT (Hydrogen Bond Thermodynamics) descriptors were derived. These equations would greatly simplify the task of the directed design of the memantine analogues with improved solubility and enhanced bioavailability.",2022-09-05
36145311,Evaluation of Novel Inhibitors of Tryptophan Dioxygenases for Enzyme and Species Selectivity Using Engineered Tumour Cell Lines Expressing Either Murine or Human IDO1 or TDO2.,"Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is commonly expressed by cancers as a mechanism for evading the immune system. Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated the potential of combining IDO1 inhibitors with immune therapies for the treatment of cancer, strengthening an interest in the discovery of novel dioxygenase inhibitors for reversing tumour-mediated immune suppression. To facilitate the discovery, development and investigation of novel small molecule inhibitors of IDO1 and its hepatic isozyme tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO2), murine tumour cells were engineered to selectively express either murine or human IDO1 and TDO2 for use as tools to dissect both the species specificity and isoenzyme selectivity of newly discovered inhibitors. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLTC) lines were engineered to express either murine or human IDO1 for use to test species selectivity of the novel inhibitors; in addition, GL261 glioma lines were engineered to express either human IDO1 or human TDO2 and used to test the isoenzyme selectivity of individual inhibitors in cell-based assays. The 20 most potent inhibitors against recombinant human IDO1 enzyme, discovered from a commissioned screening of 40,000 compounds in the Australian WEHI compound library, returned comparable IC<sub>50</sub> values against murine or human IDO1 in cell-based assays using the LLTC-mIDO1 and LLTC-hIDO1 line, respectively. To test the in vivo activity of the hits, transfected lines were inoculated into syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice. Individual LLTC-hIDO1 tumours showed variable expression of human IDO1 in contrast to GL261-hIDO1 tumours which were homogenous in their IDO1 expression and were subsequently used for in vivo studies. W-0019482, the most potent IDO1 inhibitor identified from cell-based assays, reduced plasma and intratumoural ratios of kynurenine to tryptophan (K:T) and delayed the growth of subcutaneous GL261-hIDO1 tumours in mice. Synthetic modification of W-0019482 generated analogues with dual IDO1/TDO2 inhibitory activity, as well as inhibitors that were selective for either TDO2 or IDO1. These results demonstrate the versatility of W-0019482 as a lead in generating all three subclasses of tryptophan dioxygenase inhibitors which can be applied for investigating the individual roles and interactions between IDO1 and TDO2 in driving cancer-mediated immune suppression.",2022-08-31
36142668,Stemazole Promotes Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Survival In Vitro and Remyelination In Vivo.,"Maintaining the normal function of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and protecting OPCs from damage is the basis of myelin regeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). In this paper, we investigated the effect of stemazole, a novel small molecule, on the promotion of oligodendrocyte precursor cell survival and remyelination. The results show that stemazole enhanced the survival rate and the number of clone formation in a dose-dependent manner and decreased the percentage of cell apoptosis. In particular, the number of cell clones was increased up to 6-fold (p < 0.001) in the stemazole group compared with the control group. In vivo, we assessed the effect of stemazole on recovering the motor dysfunction and demyelination induced by cuprizone (CPZ). The results show that stemazole promoted the recovery of motor dysfunction and the repair of myelin sheaths. Compared with the CPZ group, the stemazole group showed a 30.46% increase in the myelin area (p < 0.001), a 37.08% increase in MBP expression (p < 0.01), and a 1.66-fold increase in Olig2 expression (p < 0.001). Histologically, stemazole had a better effect than the positive control drugs. In conclusion, stemazole promoted OPC survival in vitro and remyelination in vivo, suggesting that this compound may be used as a therapeutic agent against demyelinating disease.",2022-09-15
36142566,Machine Learning-Based Virtual Screening for the Identification of Cdk5 Inhibitors.,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an atypical proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase well-characterized for its role in the central nervous system rather than in the cell cycle. Indeed, its dysregulation has been strongly implicated in the progression of synaptic dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), and also in the development and progression of a variety of cancers. For this reason, Cdk5 is considered as a promising target for drug design, and the discovery of novel small-molecule Cdk5 inhibitors is of great interest in the medicinal chemistry field. In this context, we employed a machine learning-based virtual screening protocol with subsequent molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy evaluations. Our virtual screening studies resulted in the identification of two novel Cdk5 inhibitors, highlighting an experimental hit rate of 50% and thus validating the reliability of the in silico workflow. Both identified ligands, compounds <b>CPD1</b> and <b>CPD4</b>, showed a promising enzyme inhibitory activity and <b>CPD1</b> also demonstrated a remarkable antiproliferative activity in ovarian and colon cancer cells. These ligands represent a valuable starting point for structure-based hit-optimization studies aimed at identifying new potent Cdk5 inhibitors.",2022-09-13
36139979,In Vitro and In Vivo Antimicrobial Activity of the Novel Peptide OMN6 against Multidrug-Resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.,"The rapid worldwide spread of antimicrobial resistance highlights the significant need for the development of innovative treatments to fight multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study describes the potent antimicrobial activity of the novel peptide OMN6 against a wide array of drug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> clinical isolates. OMN6 prevented the growth of all tested isolates, regardless of any pre-existing resistance mechanisms. Moreover, in vitro serial-passaging studies demonstrated that no resistance developed against OMN6. Importantly, OMN6 was highly efficacious in treating animal models of lung and blood infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i>. Taken together, these results point to OMN6 as a novel antimicrobial agent with the potential to treat life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> avoiding resistance.",2022-09-05
36135832,Identification and Characterization of Novel Small-Molecule SMOX Inhibitors.,"The major intracellular polyamines spermine and spermidine are abundant and ubiquitous compounds that are essential for cellular growth and development. Spermine catabolism is mediated by spermine oxidase (SMOX), a highly inducible flavin-dependent amine oxidase that is upregulated during excitotoxic, ischemic, and inflammatory states. In addition to the loss of radical scavenging capabilities associated with spermine depletion, the catabolism of spermine by SMOX results in the production of toxic byproducts, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and acrolein, a highly toxic aldehyde with the ability to form adducts with DNA and inactivate vital cellular proteins. Despite extensive evidence implicating SMOX as a key enzyme contributing to secondary injury associated with multiple pathologic states, the lack of potent and selective inhibitors has significantly impeded the investigation of SMOX as a therapeutic target. In this study, we used a virtual and physical screening approach to identify and characterize a series of hit compounds with inhibitory activity against SMOX. We now report the discovery of potent and highly selective SMOX inhibitors <b>6</b> (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.54 μM, Ki 1.60 μM) and <b>7</b> (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.23 μM, K<sub>i</sub> 0.46 μM), which are the most potent SMOX inhibitors reported to date. We hypothesize that these selective SMOX inhibitors will be useful as chemical probes to further elucidate the impact of polyamine catabolism on mechanisms of cellular injury.",2022-08-30
36133944,Recent advances in peptide-based nanomaterials for targeting hypoxia.,"Hypoxia is a prominent feature of many severe diseases such as malignant tumors, ischemic strokes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The lack of oxygen has a paramount impact on angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. The potential of hypoxia as a therapeutic target has been increasingly recognized over the last decade. In order to treat these disease states, peptides have been extensively investigated due to their advantages in safety, target specificity, and tumor penetrability. Peptides can overcome difficulties such as low drug/energy delivery efficiency, hypoxia-induced drug resistance, and tumor nonspecificity. There are three main strategies for targeting hypoxia through peptide-based nanomaterials: (i) using peptide ligands to target cellular environments unique to hypoxic conditions, such as cell surface receptors that are upregulated in cells under hypoxic conditions, (ii) utilizing peptide linkers sensitive to the hypoxic microenvironment that can be cleaved to release therapeutic or diagnostic payloads, and (iii) a combination of the above where targeting peptides will localize the system to a hypoxic environment for it to be selectively cleaved to release its payload, forming a dual-targeting system. This review focuses on recent developments in the design and construction of novel peptide-based hypoxia-targeting nanomaterials, followed by their mechanisms and potential applications in diagnosis and treatment of hypoxic diseases. In addition, we address challenges and prospects of how peptide-based hypoxia-targeting nanomaterials can achieve a wider range of clinical applications.",2021-09-03
36117157,The antimicrobial effect of a novel peptide LL-1 on Escherichia coli by increasing membrane permeability.,"The widespread use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of many drug-resistant strains; thus, the development of new antibacterial drugs is essential with antimicrobial peptides becoming the focus of research. This study assessed the antibacterial effect of a novel antimicrobial peptide, named LL-1 on Escherichia coli (E.coli) by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the antibacterial curve. The interaction between LL-1 and E. coli DNA was then detected by nucleic acid gel electrophoresis. The effect of LL-1 on the E. coli cell membrane was assessed by detecting the leakage of β-galactosidase, nucleic acid and protein. The influence of LL-1 on the intracellular ATP of E. coli was analysed by determining the concentration of intracellular ATP. Finally, the bacteria and colonies of E. coli treated with LL-1 were observed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy.",2022-09-19
36110371,Monomerization of Homodimeric Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3) by an Aminonitrile Compound Inhibits TFF3-Dependent Cancer Cell Survival.,"Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) is a secreted protein with an established oncogenic function and a highly significant association with clinical progression of various human malignancies. Herein, a novel small molecule that specifically targets TFF3 homodimeric functions was identified. Utilizing the concept of reversible covalent interaction, 2-amino-4-(4-(6-fluoro-5-methylpyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-5-oxo-4H,5H-pyrano[3,2-<i>c</i>]chromene-3-carbonitrile (AMPC) was identified as a molecule that interacted with TFF3. AMPC monomerized the cellular and secreted TFF3 homodimer at the cysteine (Cys)57-Cys57 residue with subsequent more rapid degradation of the generated TFF3 monomers. Hence, AMPC treatment also resulted in cellular depletion of TFF3 with consequent decreased cell viability in various human carcinoma-derived TFF3 expressing cell lines, including estrogen receptor positive (ER+) mammary carcinoma (MC). AMPC treatment of TFF3 expressing ER+ MC cells significantly suppressed total cell number in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, exposure of TFF3 expressing ER+ MC cells to AMPC decreased soft agar colony formation, foci formation, and growth in suspension culture and inhibited growth of preformed colonies in 3D Matrigel. AMPC increased apoptosis in TFF3 expressing ER+ MC cells associated with decreased activity of EGFR, p38, STAT3, AKT, and ERK, decreased protein levels of CCND1, CCNE1, BCL2, and BCL-XL, and increased protein levels of TP53, CDKN1A, CASP7, and CASP9. <i>siRNA</i>-mediated depletion of <i>TFF3</i> expression in ER+ MC cells efficiently abrogated AMPC-stimulated loss of cell viability and CASPASE 3/7 activities. Furthermore, in mice bearing ER+ MC cell-generated xenografts, AMPC treatment significantly impeded xenograft growth. Hence, AMPC exemplifies a novel mechanism by which small molecule drugs may inhibit a dimeric oncogenic protein and provides a strategy to impede TFF3-dependent cancer progression.",2022-08-17
36082703,Establishment and validation of a LC-MS/MS method for the determination of anlotinib in human plasma: Application to therapeutic drug monitoring.,"Anlotinib is a novel small molecule multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of several cancers. We developed and validated a highly sensitive, rapid and stable high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometrymethod for the determination of anlotinib in human plasma with anlotinib-d<sub>5</sub> as a stable isotopically labeled internal standard (SIL-IS). To explore the feasibility of therapeutic drug monitoring in the treatment of tumors with anlotinib, human plasma samples were prepared by protein precipitation. The mobile phases comprised of (A) 5.0 mm NH<sub>4</sub> AC aqueous solution containing 0.1% formic acid and (B) 100% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid. A gradient mobile phase system was adopted for chromatographic separation using a BEH C18 (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) column. A positive ion pattern was chosen for quantification under multiple reaction monitoring mode. The ion pairs were detected at m/z 408.2 → 339.1 and m/z 413.4 → 344.3 for anlotinib and anlotinib-d<sub>5</sub> (SIL-IS), respectively. The total run time was 5.0 min. The calibration curve was found to be linear within a plasma concentration range of 2-400 ng·ml<sup>-1</sup> . The precision and accuracy, matrix effect, extraction recovery and stability were all validated and met the requirements of international guidelines. The proposed methods were successfully applied to support therapeutic drug monitoring in breast and thyroid cancer patients receiving anlotinib for therapy. Clinical data showed that in the 12 mg dose group, the mean plasma concentrations of anlotinib in breast cancer patients and thyroid cancer patients were 87.1 and 118.8 ng·ml<sup>-1</sup> , respectively. The data demonstrate that the peak concentration of anlotinib may be related to the different tumor types in patients.",2022-10-05
36082025,"A novel angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptide from oyster: Simulated gastro-intestinal digestion, molecular docking, inhibition kinetics and antihypertensive effects in rats.","In this study, a novel peptide, AEYLCEAC with high angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) activity was screened from oyster (Crassostrea gigas) hydrolysates, which was obtained from simulated gastro-intestinal digestion. Candidate peptides were confirmed to have a higher binding to angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) than the positive drug phosphoinic tripeptide calculated by Discovery Studio, and AEYLCEAC showed the highest ACE inhibition rate <i>in vitro</i> with a <i>IC</i> <sub>50</sub> of 4.287 mM. Lineweaver-Burk plots confirmed that the peptidic inhibitory type of ACE is competitive. The molecular docking showed that ACEI activity of the AEYLCEAC was mainly due to the hydrogen bonding interactions with the active pockets (S1 and S2) of ACE. <i>In vivo</i>, AEYLCEAC effectively reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and Systolic blood pressure (SBP) in hypertensive rats. These results indicate that AEYLCEAC might act as a helpful ingredient in functional foods or pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.",2022-08-23
36076840,"Isolation, Purification and Structure Identification of a Calcium-Binding Peptide from Sheep Bone Protein Hydrolysate.","To isolate a novel peptide with calcium-binding capacity, sheep bone protein was hydrolyzed sequentially using a dual-enzyme system (alcalase treatment following neutrase treatment) and investigated for its characteristics, separation, purification, and structure. The sheep bone protein hydrolysate (SBPH) was enriched in key amino acids such as Gly, Arg, Pro, Leu, Lys, Glu, Val, and Asp. The fluorescence spectra, circular dichroism spectra, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results showed that adding calcium ions decreased the α-helix and β-sheet content but significantly increased the random and β-turn content (p < 0.05). Carboxyl oxygen and amino nitrogen atoms of SBPH may participate in peptide−calcium binding. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry results showed that SBPH had strong calcium-chelating ability and that the peptide−calcium complex (SBPH−Ca) combined with calcium to form a spherical cluster structure. SBPH was separated and purified gradually by ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry identified the amino acid sequences as GPSGLPGERG (925.46 Da) and GAPGKDGVRG (912.48 Da), with calcium-binding capacities of 89.76 ± 0.19% and 88.26 ± 0.25%, respectively. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for the preparation of a new type of calcium supplement and high-value utilization of sheep bone.",2022-09-01
36076834,"C-Terminal Modification on the Immunomodulatory Activity, Antioxidant Activity, and Structure-Activity Relationship of Pulsed Electric Field (PEF)-Treated Pine Nut Peptide.","In this study, a novel peptide VNAVL was synthesized by removing the C-terminal histidine on the basis of a bioactive peptide VNAVLH obtained from pine nut (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc) protein. The effects of removing histidine on antioxidant activity, immunomodulatory activity, and secondary structure of the PEF-treated peptide were discussed. Compared with VNAVLH, VNAVL only exhibited lower antioxidant activity, but no immunomodulatory activity to release TNF-α, IL-6, and NO by activating RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, both antioxidant and immune activities of VNAVLH were significantly more sensitive to treatment with 40 kV/cm than other field intensities, whereas VNAVL was not sensitive to field strength changes. CD spectra and DSSP analysis verified that both peptides consisted of a β structure and random coil, but the ability of VNAVL to transform the random coil via PEF treatment is weaker than that of VNAVLH. Therefore, PEF treatment might expose the key active site located on the C-terminal histidine by altering the secondary structure of the peptide.",2022-08-31
36054786,Safety and efficacy of jaktinib in the treatment of Janus kinase inhibitor-naïve patients with myelofibrosis: Results of a phase II trial.,"Myelofibrosis (MF) is associated with several constitutional symptoms. Currently, there are few therapeutic options for MF. Jaktinib, a novel, small-molecule inhibitor of JAK, is currently being studied for its potential to treat MF. This phase 2 trial investigated efficacy and safety of jaktinib in the treatment of MF patients. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with ≥35% reduction in spleen volume (SVR35, proportion of patients with ≥35% reduction in spleen volume) at week 24. The secondary end points included improvement of anemia, rates of symptom response, and safety profile. Between January 8, 2019 and August 29, 2020, 118 patients were recruited and treated with either jaktinib 100 mg BID or 200 mg QD. At week 24, 54.8% (34/62) of patients in the 100 mg BID group and 31.3% (15/48) in the 200 mg QD group achieved SVR35 (p = .0199). Jaktinib treatment increased hemoglobin level to ≥20 g/L in 35.6% (21/59) of patients with hemoglobin ≤100 g/L at baseline. The proportion of patients who achieved a ≥50% improvement in total symptom score at week 24 was 69.6% (39/56) in the BID group and 57.5% (23/40) in the QD group. The most common ≥ grade 3 hematological treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; ≥ 10%) were anemia (100 mg BID: 24.2%, 200 mg QD: 28.8%), thrombocytopenia (16.7%, 11.5%), and neutropenia (3.0%, 11.5%). All non-hematological TEAEs were mild. These results indicate that jaktinib can shrink the spleen, improve anemia, and other clinical symptoms with good tolerability.",2022-10-04
36053920,Development of a novel peptide inhibitor of subtilisin BPN'.,"Proteinaceous protease inhibitors can strongly and specifically inhibit cognate proteases, but their use as pharmaceuticals is limited by their size. As such, the development of effective protease peptide inhibitors would be beneficial for biochemical studies and drug discovery. In this study, we applied a phage display system to select subtilisin BPN'-binding peptides and evaluated their inhibitory activities against subtilisin BPN'. A 12mer peptide with an intramolecular disulfide bond inhibited subtilisin BPN' (K<sub>i</sub> value of 13.0 nm). Further mutational analyses of the peptide resulted in the development of a short peptide inhibitor against subtilisin BPN' that showed high inhibitory activity and binding affinity (K<sub>i</sub> value of 0.30 nm). This activity was found to be derived from the conformational rigidity caused by the intramolecular disulfide bond and the small residue at the P1' site and from the interaction of the P4 and P6' residues with subtilisin BPN'.",2022-09-22
36044968,Identification and characterization of a novel peptide from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus iniae.,"The overuse and misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial species which remain a challenge to treat therapeutically. Novel and efficacious drugs are desperately needed to combat pathogens. One method to facilitate these discoveries is the use of in silico methods. Computational biology has the power to scan large data sets and screen for potential molecules with antibacterial function. In the current study, an in silico approach was used to identify an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derived from rainbow trout von Willebrand Factor. The AMP was tested against a panel of aquatic bacterial pathogens and was found to possess antibacterial activity against Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae). Since S. iniae is a zoonotic pathogen, this may be useful in other species as well. The peptide was non-hemolytic and non-cytotoxic at the concentrations tested in rainbow trout cells. Pre-treatment of rainbow trout cells with the peptide did not result in an upregulation of immune genes but stimulating the rainbow trout macrophage/monocyte-like cell line, RTS11, with heat-killed S. iniae, did result in a significant upregulation of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfa) gene. In this study, a new AMP has been identified but its expression, synthesis and role in vivo remains unknown. Nevertheless, the findings presented improve our understanding of fish gill and macrophage responses towards this important zoonotic pathogen.",2022-08-28
36037785,Malat1 attenuated the rescuing effects of docosahexaenoic acid on osteoarthritis treatment via repressing its chondroprotective and chondrogenesis activities.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease associated with joint inflammation, articular cartilage degeneration and subchondral hypertrophy. Small molecules which both ameliorate chondrocyte OA phenotype and activate bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) chondrogenesis under inflammatory conditions have the therapeutical potential for OA treatment. In this study, we characterized a novel small molecule which could ameliorate OA progression via novel regulating mechanisms. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a bioactive molecule, was screened from a small molecule library and showed anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects in OA chondrocytes, as well as ameliorated IL-1β impaired BMSCs chondrogenesis in Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling dependent manners. Furthermore, Malat1 was found to be the key mediator of DHA-mediating anti-inflammation chondroprotection and chondrogenesis. DHA also rescued cartilage loss and damage in a surgery-induced OA mice model. The elevation of serum Malat1 levels caused by OA was also downregulated by DHA treatment. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that DHA, with a dual-signaling repression property, exerted its anti-inflammation, chondroprotection and chondrogenesis function possibly via regulating Malat1 level, suggesting that it may be a possible drug candidate for OA patients with elevated MALAT1 expression levels.",2022-08-26
36037192,Huntington's disease phenotypes are improved via mTORC1 modulation by small molecule therapy.,"Huntington's Disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease for which the major causes of mortality are neurodegeneration-associated aspiration pneumonia followed by cardiac failure. mTORC1 pathway perturbations are present in HD models and human tissues. Amelioration of mTORC1 deficits by genetic modulation improves disease phenotypes in HD models, is not a viable therapeutic strategy. Here, we assessed a novel small molecule mTORC1 pathway activator, NV-5297, for its improvement of the disease phenotypes in the N171-82Q HD mouse model. Oral dosing of NV-5297 over 6 weeks activated mTORC1, increased striatal volume, improved motor learning and heart contractility. Further, the heart contractility, heart fibrosis, and survival were improved in response to the cardiac stressor isoprenaline when compared to vehicle-treated mice. Cummulatively, these data support mTORC1 activation as a therapeutic target in HD and consolidates NV-5297 as a promising drug candidate for treating central and peripheral HD phenotypes and, more generally, mTORC1-deficit related diseases.",2022-08-29
36027928,Pharmacological characterization of a novel peptide inhibitor of the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction.,"LAS200813 is a novel bicyclic lipopeptide that activates Nrf2 by binding to Keap1, thereby antagonising the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction. In this work we report the pharmacological characterization of LAS200813 in Nrf2-dependent translational preclinical models. LAS200813 binds to Keap1 with high affinity (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.73 nM) and is able to induce the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus. Furthermore, LAS200813 increases the expression of Nrf2 target genes in human bronchial epithelial cells (EC<sub>50</sub> of 96 and 70 nM for srxn1 and nqo1, respectively). Similarly, the intratracheal administration of LAS200813 to rats increases the expression of Nrf2-dependent genes in lung tissue, an effect that lasts for a few hours. Moreover, in cells exposed to cigarette smoke, LAS200813 shows an antioxidant effect by increasing the production of glutathione and prevents cellular apoptosis. In conclusion, the results described herein demonstrate that LAS200813 is a potent non-electrophilic Nrf2-activating peptide designed to be administered by inhaled route which may be a potential therapeutic strategy for respiratory diseases driven by oxidative stress.",2022-08-24
36009550,"LLL12B, a Novel Small-Molecule STAT3 Inhibitor, Induces Apoptosis and Suppresses Cell Migration and Tumor Growth in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.","Persistent STAT3 signaling plays a pivotal role in human tumor malignancy, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). There are few treatment options currently available for TNBC; thus, given its importance to cancer, STAT3 is a potential cancer therapeutic target and is the focus of drug discovery efforts. In this study, we tested a novel orally bioavailable small-molecule STAT3 inhibitor, LLL12B, in human MDA-MB-231, SUM159, and murine 4T1 TNBC cell lines. TNBC cells frequently expressed persistent STAT3 phosphorylation and their cell viability was sensitive to STAT3 knockdown by siRNA. LLL12B selectively inhibited the IL-6-mediated induction of STAT3 phosphorylation, but had little effect on the IFN-γ-mediated induction of STAT1 phosphorylation nor the EGF-mediated induction of ERK phosphorylation. In addition, targeting STAT3 with LLL12B induced apoptosis, reduced colony formation ability, and inhibited cell migration in TNBC cells. Furthermore, LLL12B suppressed the tumor growth of the MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells in a mammary fat pad mouse tumor model in vivo. Together, our findings support the concept that targeting persistent STAT3 signaling using the novel small-molecule LLL12B is a potential approach for TNBC therapy.",2022-08-18
36009344,Antioxidant Therapy Significantly Attenuates Hepatotoxicity following Low Dose Exposure to Microcystin-LR in a Murine Model of Diet-Induced Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"We have previously shown in a murine model of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) that chronic, low-dose exposure to the Harmful Algal Bloom cyanotoxin microcystin-LR (MC-LR), resulted in significant hepatotoxicity including micro-vesicular lipid accumulation, impaired toxin metabolism as well as dysregulation of the key signaling pathways involved in inflammation, immune response and oxidative stress. On this background we hypothesized that augmentation of hepatic drug metabolism pathways with targeted antioxidant therapies would improve MC-LR metabolism and reduce hepatic injury in NAFLD mice exposed to MC-LR. We chose N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 40 mM), a known antioxidant that augments the glutathione detoxification pathway and a novel peptide (pNaKtide, 25 mg/kg) which is targeted to interrupting a specific Src-kinase mediated pro-oxidant amplification mechanism. Histological analysis showed significant increase in hepatic inflammation in NAFLD mice exposed to MC-LR which was attenuated on treatment with both NAC and pNaKtide (both <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). Oxidative stress, as measured by 8-OHDG levels in urine and protein carbonylation in liver sections, was also significantly downregulated upon treatment with both antioxidants after MC-LR exposure. Genetic analysis of key drug transporters including <i>Abcb1a</i>, Phase I enzyme-<i>Cyp3a11</i> and Phase II metabolic enzymes-<i>Pkm</i> (Pyruvate kinase, muscle), <i>Pklr</i> (Pyruvate kinase, liver, and red blood cell) and <i>Gad1</i> (Glutamic acid decarboxylase) was significantly altered by MC-LR exposure as compared to the non-exposed control group (all <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). These changes were significantly attenuated with both pNaKtide and NAC treatment. These results suggest that MC-LR metabolism and detoxification is significantly impaired in the setting of NAFLD, and that these pathways can potentially be reversed with targeted antioxidant treatment.",2022-08-22
35996739,'Cloudbuster': a Python-based open source application for three-dimensional reconstruction and quantification of stacked biological imaging samples.,"Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures are generating increasing interest in cancer research, e.g. for the evaluation of pharmacological effects of novel small molecule inhibitors. This is mainly due to the fact that such 3D structures reflect physiological characteristics of tumours and the cellular microenvironments they reside in more faithfully than two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures; in addition, they allow the reduction of animal experiments while providing significantly relevant human-based models. Quantification of such organoid structures as well as the mainly slice-based acquisition and thus forced 2D representation of 3D spheroids provide a challenge for the interpretation of the associated generated data. Here, we provide a novel open-source workflow to reconstruct a 3D entity from slice-recorded microscopical images with or without treatment with anti-migratory small molecule inhibitors. This reconstruction produces distinct point clouds as basis for subsequent comparison of basic readout parameters using average computer processor, memory and graphics resources within an acceptable time frame. We were able to validate the usefulness of this workflow using 3D data generated by various imaging techniques, including <i>z</i>-stacks from confocal microscopy and histochemically labelled spheroid sectioning, and demonstrate the possibility to accurately characterize inhibitor effects in great detail.",2022-08-12
35995319,"Novel carvedilol-loaded pro-phytomicelles: formulation, characterization and enhanced protective efficacy against acetaminophen-inducedliverinjury in mice.","The work describes a novel, small-molecule phytochemicals as nanomaterials based pro-micelles (pro-phytomicelles) drug delivery system, for oral delivery of carvedilol (CAR). This novel nanoformulation of CAR, named CAR pro-phytomicelles, was prepared with rebaudioside A (RA) and dipotassium glycyrrhizinate (DG) as mixed nanomaterials. The formulation was optimized, leading to a 502-fold increase in solubility of CAR in water as a result of encapsulation within mixed phytomicelles based on DG and RA. CAR pro-phytomicelles samples could be instantly dissolved into aqueous media to formulate clear phytomicelle solutions with CAR encapsulation efficiency of 99.67 ± 0.02 %, and small micelle size of 15.62 ± 0.27 nm. CAR pro-phytomicelles exhibited good storage stability, rapid in vitro release in simulated intestinal fluid, and improved in vitro antioxidant activity. CAR pro-phytomicelles had good biocompatibility. Protective efficacy evaluation revealed that acetaminophen overdose could induce high mortality and severe liver injury in mice, while CAR pro-phytomicelle treatment exhibited significant protective effect against acetaminophen overdose. This protective efficacy was due to a mechanism that involved the regulation of high-mobility group box 1 and its signaling-related proinflammatory cytokines. These results show that pro-phytomicelles could provide a new concept and promising therapeutics as nanomedicines for improving the activities of CAR against acetaminophen-induced liver injury.",2022-08-20
35993870,Anti-inflammatory effects of tripeptide WLS on TNF-α-induced HT-29 cells and DSS-induced colitis in mice.,"Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic disease of the intestinal tract, which is related to increased levels of various inflammatory mediators. This study aims to explore the anti-inflammatory mechanism of small molecular peptide WLS and its alleviating effect on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In TNF-α-induced HT-29 cells, WLS inhibited IL-8 secretion, decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, and inhibited the activation of MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways. In the dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) induced colitis mouse model, WLS inhibited weight loss and disease activity index scores, increased colon length, improved colon histopathology, inhibited secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in the colon, and down-regulated gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-17A). This study revealed that WLS was a novel small molecule peptide with anti-inflammatory activity and may be a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",2022-09-22
35991612,Advanced Peptide Nanomedicines for Bladder Cancer Theranostics.,"Cancer is still a global public health problem. Although remarkable success has been achieved in cancer diagnosis and treatment, the high recurrence and mortality rates remain severely threatening to human lives and health. In recent years, peptide nanomedicines with precise selectivity and high biocompatibility have attracted intense attention in biomedical applications. In particular, there has been a significant increase in the exploration of peptides and their derivatives for malignant tumor therapy and diagnosis. Herein, we review the applications of peptides and their derivatives in the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer, providing new insights for the design and development of novel peptide nanomedicines for the treatment of bladder cancer in the future.",2022-08-05
35990007,Comparison of the Tissue Distribution of a Long-Circulating Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Agonist Determined by Positron Emission Tomography and Quantitative Whole-Body Autoradiography.,"Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that enables non-invasive visualization of tracer distribution and pharmacology. Recently, peptides with long half-lives allowed once-a-week dosing of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists with therapeutic applications in diabetes and obesity. PET imaging for such long-lived peptides is hindered by the typically used short-lived radionuclides. Zirconium-89 (<sup>89</sup>Zr) emerged as a promising PET radionuclide with a sufficiently long half-life to be applied for biodistribution studies of long-circulating biomolecules. A comparison between the biodistribution profiles obtained via <sup>89</sup>Zr-PET and the current standard, quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA), will be valuable for the development of novel peptide drugs. We determined the PET biodistribution of a <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled acylated peptide agonist of GLP-1R and compared it to the profile obtained by QWBA using analogous tritiated tracers for up to 1 week after administration. The plasma metabolic profile was obtained and identification was done for the tritiated tracers. We found that, at early time points, the biodistribution profiles agreed between PET and QWBA. At the latertime points, the <sup>89</sup>Zr tracer remained primarily trapped in the kidneys. The introduction of desferrioxamine (DFO) chelator reduced the peptide stability, and UPLC-MS analysis identified a circulating metabolite arising from DFO hydrolysis. Kidney accumulation of radiolabeled peptides and DFO metabolic instability may compromise biodistribution studies using <sup>89</sup>Zr-PET to support the development of new biopharmaceuticals. PET and QWBA biodistribution data correlated well during the absorption phase, but new and more stable <sup>89</sup>Zr chelators are needed for a more accurate description of the elimination phase.",2022-06-30
35982147,Novel covalent and non-covalent complex-based pharmacophore models of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) elucidated by microsecond MD simulations.,"As the world enters its second year of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, intense efforts have been directed to develop an effective diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies. One promising drug target to design COVID-19 treatments is the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. To date, a comparative understanding of M<sup>pro</sup> dynamic stereoelectronic interactions with either covalent or non-covalent inhibitors (depending on their interaction with a pocket called S1' or oxyanion hole) has not been still achieved. In this study, we seek to fill this knowledge gap using a cascade in silico protocol of docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM/PBSA in order to elucidate pharmacophore models for both types of inhibitors. After docking and MD analysis, a set of complex-based pharmacophore models was elucidated for covalent and non-covalent categories making use of the residue bonding point feature. The highest ranked models exhibited ROC-AUC values of 0.93 and 0.73, respectively for each category. Interestingly, we observed that the active site region of M<sup>pro</sup> protein-ligand complex undergoes large conformational changes, especially within the S2 and S4 subsites. The results reported in this article may be helpful in virtual screening (VS) campaigns to guide the design and discovery of novel small-molecule therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> protein.",2022-08-18
35971165,De Novo Design of an Androgen Receptor DNA Binding Domain-Targeted peptide PROTAC for Prostate Cancer Therapy.,"Androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7), one of the major driving factors, is the most attractive drug target in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Currently, no available drugs efficiently target AR-V7 in clinical practice. The DNA binding domain (DBD) is indispensable for the transcriptional activity of AR full length and AR splice variants, including AR-V7. Based on the homodimerization structure of the AR DBD, a novel peptide-based proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) drug is designed to induce AR and AR-V7 degradation in a DBD and MDM2-dependent manner, without showing any activity on other hormone receptors. To overcome the short half-life and poor cell penetrability of peptide PROTAC drugs, an ultrasmall gold (Au)-peptide complex platform to deliver the AR DBD PROTAC in vivo is developed. The obtained Au-AR pep-PROTAC effectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in prostate cancer cell lines, particularly in CWR22Rv1 cells with DC<sub>50</sub> values 48.8 and 79.2 nM, respectively. Au-AR pep-PROTAC results in suppression of AR levels and induces tumor regression in both enzalutamide sensitive and resistant prostate cancer animal models. Further optimization of the Au-AR pep-PROTAC can ultimately lead to a new therapy for AR-V7-positive CRPC.",2022-08-15
35966590,Conquering oncogenic KRAS and its bypass mechanisms.,"Aberrant activation of KRAS signaling is common in cancer, which has catalyzed heroic drug development efforts to target KRAS directly or its downstream signaling effectors. Recent works have yielded novel small molecule drugs with promising preclinical and clinical activities. Yet, no matter how a cancer is addicted to a specific target - cancer's genetic and biological plasticity fashions a variety of resistance mechanisms as a fait accompli, limiting clinical benefit of targeted interventions. Knowledge of these mechanisms may inform combination strategies to attack both oncogenic KRAS and subsequent bypass mechanisms.",2022-07-18
35963541,Interrupting specific hydrogen bonds between ELF3 and MED23 as an alternative drug resistance-free strategy for HER2-overexpressing cancers.,"HER2 overexpression induces cancer aggression and frequent recurrences in many solid tumors. Because HER2 overproduction is generally followed by gene amplification, inhibition of protein-protein interaction (PPI) between transcriptional factor ELF3 and its coactivator MED23 has been considered an effective but challenging strategy.",2022-08-10
35954311,Preliminary Discovery of Small Molecule Inhibitors of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) That Bind to the Extracellular Domain.,"The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the protein kinase superfamily. It is composed of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane anchoring region and a cytoplasmic region endowed with tyrosine kinase activity. Genetic mutations of EGFR kinase cause higher activity thereby stimulating downstream signaling pathways that, in turn, impact transcription and cell cycle progression. Due to the involvement of mutant EGFR in tumors and inflammatory diseases, in the past decade, several EGFR inhibitory strategies have been extensively studied, either targeting the extracellular domain (through monoclonal antibodies) or the intracellular kinase domain (through ATP-mimic small molecules). Monoclonal antibodies impair the binding to growth factor, the receptor dimerization, and its activation, whereas small molecules block the intracellular catalytic activity. Herein, we describe the development of a novel small molecule, called <b>DSF-102,</b> that interacts with the extracellular domain of EGFR. When tested in vitro in KRAS mutant A549 cells, it impairs EGFR activity by exerting (i) dose-dependent toxicity effects; (ii) a negative regulation of ERK, MAPK p38 and AKT; and (iii) a modulation of the intracellular trafficking and lysosomal degradation of EGFR. Interestingly, <b>DSF-102</b> exerts its EGFR inhibitory activity without showing interaction with the intracellular kinase domain. Taken together, these findings suggest that <b>DSF-102</b> is a promising hit compound for the development of a novel class of anti-EGFR compounds, i.e., small molecules able to interact with the extracellular domain of EGFR and useful for overcoming the KRAS-driven resistance to TKI treatment.",2022-07-27
35952982,NLRP3 inflammasome in neurodegenerative disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a dysregulated neuro-glial microenvironment, culminating in functional deficits resulting from neuronal cell death. Inflammation is a hallmark of the neurodegenerative microenvironment and despite a critical role in tissue homeostasis, increasing evidence suggests that chronic inflammatory insult can contribute to progressive neuronal loss. Inflammation has been studied in the context of neurodegenerative disorders for decades but few anti-inflammatory treatments have advanced to clinical use. This is likely due to the related challenges of predicting and mitigating off-target effects impacting the normal immune response while detecting inflammatory signatures that are specific to the progression of neurological disorders. Inflammasomes are pro-inflammatory cytosolic pattern recognition receptors functioning in the innate immune system. Compelling pre-clinical data has prompted an intense interest in the role of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in neurodegenerative disease. NLRP3 is typically inactive but can respond to sterile triggers commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders including protein misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial and oxidative stress, and exposure to disease-associated environmental toxicants. Clear evidence of enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activity in common neurodegenerative diseases has coincided with rapid advancement of novel small molecule therapeutics making the NLRP3 inflammasome an attractive target for near-term interventional studies. In this review, we highlight evidence from model systems and patients indicating inflammasome activity in neurodegenerative disease associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome's ability to recognize pathologic forms of amyloid-β, tau, and α-synuclein. We discuss inflammasome-driven pyroptotic processes highlighting the potential utility of evaluating extracellular inflammasome-related proteins in the context of biomarker discovery. We complete the report by pointing out gaps in our understanding of intracellular modifiers of inflammasome activity and mechanisms regulating the resolution of inflammasome activation. The literature review and perspectives provide a conceptual platform for continued analysis of inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases through the study of inflammasomes and pyroptosis, mechanisms of inflammation and cell death now recognized to function in multiple highly prevalent neurological disorders.",2022-08-08
35952401,Intelligent triggering of nanomicelles based on a ROS-activated anticancer prodrug and photodynamic therapy (PDT)-synergistic therapy for lung cancers.,"The intelligent triggering of drug release at targeted sites is essential for the safety and efficacy of cancer therapies. This study aimed to design and synthesize a novel prodrug (DHA-S-CA) using a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive moiety, thioacetal, to bridge cinnamaldehyde (CA) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA). As ROS are highly expressed in tumor tissues, the design uses the ROS-responsive moiety as an effective target for the nanodrug delivery system. Furthermore, the near-infrared dye IR808 and the prodrug were adopted to prepare co-loaded Soluplus®/TPGS nanomicelles (IR808/DHA-S-CA NMs). The photosensitized agent IR808 exhibited both tumor accumulation and cancer imaging properties while generating ROS during laser irradiation. Intracellular ROS detection indicated that the prodrug DHA-S-CA could degrade via the high concentration of ROS in cancer cells induced by laser irradiation, and the released CA stimulated mitochondria to regenerate additional ROS to further improve the antitumor effect of DHA. Combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT), IR808/DHA-S-CA (+) NMs outperformed free DHA, DHA NMs, and IR808/DHA-S-CA (-) in a comparison of their pharmacokinetic profiles because it had a longer circulation time and a greater area under the curve (AUC). Compared with other DHA groups, the ROS-responsive IR808/DHA-S-CA (+) micelles had comparable cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, the ROS-responsive IR808/DHA-S-CA (+) micelles exhibited markedly higher anticancer efficiency on lung cancer cells than the other DHA groups. Overall, these results indicated that the therapeutic strategy of our novel small-molecule prodrug combined with PDT has great potential for the treatment of tumors.",2022-08-03
35945596,Development of a novel peptide to prevent entry of SARS-CoV-2 into lung and olfactory bulb cells of hACE2 expressing mice.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there are no effective treatments specifically for COVID-19 infection. The initial step in SARS-CoV-2 infection is attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface. We have developed a protein peptide that effectively disrupts the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2. When delivered by nasal spray, our peptide prevents SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from entering lung and olfactory bulb cells of mice expressing human ACE2. Our peptide represents a potential novel treatment and prophylaxis against COVID-19.",2022-08-09
35943255,Targeting Doublecortin-Like Kinase 1 (DCLK1)-Regulated SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis in COVID-19.,"Host factors play critical roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated pathology and the severity of COVID-19. In this study, we systematically analyzed the roles of SARS-CoV-2-induced host factors, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), and S100A9 in viral pathogenesis. In autopsied subjects with COVID-19 and pre-existing chronic liver disease, we observed high levels of DCLK1 and S100A9 expression and immunosuppressive (DCLK1<sup>+</sup>S100A9<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup>) M2-like macrophages and N2-like neutrophils in lungs and livers. DCLK1 and S100A9 expression were rarely observed in normal controls, COVID-19-negative subjects with chronic lung disease, or COVID-19 subjects without chronic liver disease. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we detected 2 to 3-fold increased levels of circulating DCLK1<sup>+</sup>S100A9<sup>+</sup> mononuclear cells that correlated with disease severity. We validated the SARS-CoV-2-dependent generation of these double-positive immune cells in coculture. SARS-CoV-2-induced DCLK1 expression correlated with the activation of β-catenin, a known regulator of the DCLK1 promoter. Gain and loss of function studies showed that DCLK1 kinase amplified live virus production and promoted cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Inhibition of DCLK1 kinase blocked pro-inflammatory caspase-1/interleukin-1β signaling in infected cells. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with inhibitors of DCLK1 kinase and S100A9 normalized cytokine/chemokine profiles and attenuated DCLK1 expression and β-catenin activation. In conclusion, we report previously unidentified roles of DCLK1 in augmenting SARS-CoV-2 viremia, inflammatory cytokine expression, and dysregulation of immune cells involved in innate immunity. DCLK1 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19, especially in patients with underlying comorbid diseases associated with DCLK1 expression. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> High mortality in COVID-19 is associated with underlying comorbidities such as chronic liver diseases. Successful treatment of severe/critical COVID-19 remains challenging. Herein, we report a targetable host factor, DCLK1, that amplifies SARS-CoV-2 production, cytokine secretion, and inflammatory pathways via activation of β-catenin(p65)/DCLK1/S100A9/NF-<i>κ</i>B signaling. Furthermore, we observed in the lung, liver, and blood an increased prevalence of immune cells coexpressing DCLK1 and S100A9, a myeloid-derived proinflammatory protein. These cells were associated with increased disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we used a novel small-molecule inhibitor of DCLK1 kinase (DCLK1-IN-1) and S100A9 inhibitor (tasquinimod) to decrease virus production <i>in vitro</i> and normalize hyperinflammatory responses known to contribute to disease severity in COVID-19.",2022-08-09
35941127,Nrf2 signaling activation by a small molecule activator compound 16 inhibits hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury and death in osteoblasts.,"We explored the potential activity of compound 16 (Cpd16), a novel small molecule Nrf2 activator, in hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-stimulated osteoblasts. In the primary murine/human osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1 murine osteoblastic cells, Cpd16 treatment at micro-molar concentrations caused disassociation of Keap1-Nrf2 and Nrf2 cascade activation. Cpd16 induced stabilization of Nrf2 protein and its nuclear translocation, thereby increasing the antioxidant response elements (ARE) reporter activity and Nrf2 response genes transcription in murine and human osteoblasts. Significantly, Cpd16 mitigated oxidative injury in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-stimulited osteoblasts. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-provoked apoptosis as well as programmed necrosis in osteoblasts were significantly alleviated by the novel Nrf2 activator. Cpd16-induced Nrf2 activation and osteoblasts protection were stronger than other known Nrf2 activators. Dexamethasone- and nicotine-caused oxidative stress and death in osteoblasts were attenuated by Cpd16 as well. Cpd16-induced osteoblast cytoprotection was abolished by Nrf2 short hairpin RNA or knockout, but was mimicked by Keap1 knockout. Keap1 Cys151S mutation abolished Cpd16-induced Nrf2 cascade activation and osteoblasts protection against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Importantly, weekly Cpd16 administration largely ameliorated trabecular bone loss in ovariectomy mice. Together, Cpd16 alleviates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress and death in osteoblasts by activating Nrf2 cascade.",2022-08-08
35930922,Novel isatin-based hybrids as potential anti-rheumatoid arthritis drug candidates: Synthesis and biological evaluation.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease accompanied with serious symptoms, such as joint destruction and chronic synovitis. Though many anti-RA drugs could improve the outcome of RA patients to a certain extent, about 40% inefficient rate, severe side effects, and high costs have become urgent problems. Therefore, exploring new alternative drugs for RA therapy is still an urgent need so far. Isatin is an important structural motif found in numerous biologically active compounds and therapeutic agents. Herein, we aim to synthesize several novel isatin analogues for RA therapy and further explore the mechanism of the most potential anti-RA drug candidate in suppressing the pathological progress of RA in vitro and in vivo. We found that the most therapeutic potential compound, a novel small molecule isatin-honokiol hybrid named CT5-2 inhibited the viability of RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), an effector cell of synovial hyperplasia in the RA synovial tissue with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 8.54 to 10.66 μM. In addition, CT5-2 reduced the DNA replication and triggered cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Moreover, differential analyses of RNA-sequencing and the mechanistic studies demonstrated that CDCA7 is a key gene correlated with RA progression, and CT5-2 could inhibit the c-Myc/CDCA7/p65 pathway to regulate CDK1, Bcl-2, and vimentin in RA-FLSs. Furthermore, CT5-2 relieved collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and reduced the level of CDCA7, CDK1, Bcl-2, and vimentin of synovial tissue in CIA mice. Taken together, the novel small molecule isatin-honokiol hybrid CT5-2 exhibits a potential anti-RA drug candidate that inhibits proliferation and triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of RA-FLSs by regulating the c-Myc/CDCA7/p65 pathway. Our study lays a good foundation for further clinical research and structuralmodification of CT5-2.",2022-07-29
35920072,Lysine-Tethered Stable Bicyclic Cationic Antimicrobial Peptide Combats Bacterial Infection in Vivo.,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted great attention as next generation antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. Poor proteolytic stability has however undermined clinical applications of AMPs. A novel peptide cyclization approach is described to enhance the <i>in vivo</i> antibacterial activity of AMPs. Bicyclic antimicrobial peptides were synthesized by cross-linking the ε-amino groups of three lysine residues with a 1,3,5-trimethylene benzene spacer. In a proof of principal study, four bicyclic peptides were synthesized from the cationic AMP OH-CM6. One bicyclic peptide retained strong antimicrobial activity and low toxicity but exhibited a prolonged half-life in serum. Antibacterial activity was consequently improved <i>in vivo</i> without renal or hepato-toxicity. The novel peptide cyclization approach represents an important tool for enhancing AMP proteolytic stability for improved treatment of bacterial infection.",2022-08-03
35918411,Discovery and identification of a novel small molecule BCL-2 inhibitor that binds to the BH4 domain.,"The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein family plays a pivotal role in regulating the apoptosis process. BCL-2, as an antiapoptotic protein in this family, mediates apoptosis resistance and is an ideal target for cell death strategies in cancer therapy. Traditional treatment modalities target BCL-2 by occupying the hydrophobic pocket formed by BCL-2 homology (BH) domains 1-3, while in recent years, the BH4 domain of BCL-2 has also been considered an attractive novel target. Herein, we describe the discovery and identification of DC-B01, a novel BCL-2 inhibitor targeting the BH4 domain, through virtual screening combined with biophysical and biochemical methods. Our results from surface plasmon resonance and cellular thermal shift assay confirmed that the BH4 domain is responsible for the interaction between BCL-2 and DC-B01. As evidenced by further cell-based experiments, DC-B01 induced cell killing in a BCL-2-dependent manner and triggered apoptosis via the mitochondria-mediated pathway. DC-B01 disrupted the BCL-2/c-Myc interaction and consequently suppressed the transcriptional activity of c-Myc. Moreover, DC-B01 inhibited tumor growth in vivo in a BCL‑2‑dependent manner. Collectively, these results indicate that DC-B01 is a promising BCL-2 BH4 domain inhibitor with the potential for further development.",2022-08-02
35911754,The Therapeutic Potential of Targeting NIK in B Cell Malignancies.,"NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) is a key player in non-canonical NF-κB signaling, involved in several fundamental cellular processes, and is crucial for B cell function and development. In response to certain signals and ligands, such as CD40, BAFF and lymphotoxin-β activation, NIK protein stabilization and subsequent NF-κB activation is achieved. Overexpression or overactivation of NIK is associated with several malignancies, including activating mutations in multiple myeloma (MM) and gain-of-function in MALT lymphoma as a result of post-translational modifications. Consequently, drug discovery studies are devoted to pharmacologic modulation of NIK and development of specific novel small molecule inhibitors. However, disease-specific <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies investigating NIK inhibition are as of yet lacking, and clinical trials with NIK inhibitors remain to be initiated. In order to bridge the gap between bench and bedside, this review first briefly summarizes our current knowledge on NIK activation, functional activity and stability. Secondly, we compare current inhibitors targeting NIK based on efficacy and specificity, and provide a future perspective on the therapeutic potential of NIK inhibition in B cell malignancies.",2022-07-12
35910806,Progress in advanced nanotherapeutics for enhanced photodynamic immunotherapy of tumor.,"Clinically, the conventional treatments of cancer are still often accompanied by tumor recurrence, metastasis and other poor prognosis. Nowadays, more attention has been paid to photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is regarded as an adjuvant antineoplastic strategy with superiorities in great spatiotemporal selectivity and minimal invasiveness. In addition to eliminating tumor cells via reactive oxygen species (ROS), more meaningfully, this phototherapy can trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) that plays a vital role in photodynamic immunotherapy (PDIT). ICD-based PDIT holds some immunotherapeutic potential due to further enhanced antitumor efficacy by utilizing various combined therapies to increase ICD levels. To help the PDIT-related drugs improve pharmacokinetic properties, bioavailability and system toxicity, multifunctional nanocarriers can be reasonably designed for enhanced PDIT. In further consideration of severe hypoxia, low immunity and immune checkpoints in tumor microenvironment (TME), advanced nanotherapeutics-mediated PDIT has been extensively studied for boosting antitumor immunity by oxygen-augment, ICD-boosting, adjuvant stimulation and combined checkpoints blockade. Herein, this review will summarize different categories of nanocarriers consisting of their material type, targeting and stimuli-responsiveness. Moreover, we will focus on the latest progress of various strategies to enhance the antitumor immune effect for PDIT and elucidate their corresponding immune-activation mechanisms. Nevertheless, there are several thorny challenges in PDIT, including limited light penetration, tumor hypoxia, immune escape and the development of novel small-molecule compounds that replace immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for easy integration into nanosystems. It is hoped that these issues raised will be helpful to the preclinical study of nanotherapeutics-based PDIT, thus accelerating the transformation of PDIT to clinical practice.",2022-07-04
35904556,Peptide-to-Small Molecule: A Pharmacophore-Guided Small Molecule Lead Generation Strategy from High-Affinity Macrocyclic Peptides.,"Recent technological innovations have led to the development of methods for the rapid identification of high-affinity macrocyclic peptides for a wide range of targets; however, it is still challenging to achieve the desired activity and membrane permeability at the same time. Here, we propose a novel small molecule lead discovery strategy, ″Peptide-to-Small Molecule″, which is a combination of rapid identification of high-affinity macrocyclic peptides <i>via</i> peptide display screening followed by pharmacophore-guided <i>de novo</i> design of small molecules, and demonstrate the applicability using nicotinamide <i>N</i>-methyltransferase (NNMT) as a target. Affinity selection by peptide display technology identified macrocyclic peptide <b>1</b> that exhibited good enzymatic inhibitory activity but no cell-based activity. Thereafter, a peptide pharmacophore-guided <i>de novo</i> design and further structure-based optimization resulted in highly potent and cell-active small molecule <b>14</b> (cell-free IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.0011 μM, cell-based IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.40 μM), indicating that this strategy could be a new option for drug discovery.",2022-07-29
35900924,A Small-Molecule Based Organic Nanoparticle for Photothermal Therapy and Near-Infrared-IIb Imaging.,"Near-infrared window IIb (NIR-IIb, 1500-1700 nm) fluorescence imaging demonstrates attractive properties including low scattering, low absorption, and deep tissue penetration, and photothermal therapy (PTT) is also a promising modality for cancer treatment. However, until now, there is no report on theranostic systems based on small organic molecules combining fluorescence imaging in the NIR-IIb and PTT, highlighting the challenge and strong need for development of such agents. Herein, we report a novel small molecule NIR-IIb dye IT-TQF with a D-A-D structure, which exhibited high fluorescence intensity in the NIR-IIb window. To further translate IT-TQF into an effective theranostic agent, IT-TQF was encapsulated into DSPE-PEG<sub>2000</sub> to construct IT-TQF NPs. The physical and photochemical properties of the nanoprobe were investigated <i>in vitro</i>, and the <i>in vivo</i> NIR-IIb imaging and PTT performance were evaluated in normal, subcutaneous, orthotopic, and metastatic tumor mice models. IT-TQF NP-based NIR-IIb imaging demonstrated high spatial resolution and high tissue penetration depth, and small normal blood vessels (55.3 μm) were successfully imaged in the NIR-IIb window. Subcutaneous, orthotopic, and metastatic tumors were all clearly delineated. A high tumor signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 9.42 was achieved for orthotopic osteosarcoma models, and the erosions of bone tissue caused by tumor cells were precisely visualized. Moreover, NIR-II image-guided surgery was successfully performed to completely remove the orthotopic tumor. Importantly, IT-TQF NPs displayed high PTT efficacy (photothermal conversion efficiency: 47%) for effective treatment of tumor mice. In conclusion, IT-TQF NPs are a novel and promising phototheranostic agent in the NIR-IIb window, and the nanoprobe has high potential for a broad range of biomedical applications.",2022-07-28
35897705,Inhibition of Ubiquitin-Specific Protease-13 Improves Behavioral Performance in Alpha-Synuclein Expressing Mice.,"Ubiquitin-Specific Protease-13 (USP13) promotes protein de-ubiquitination. USP13 levels are upregulated in post-mortem Parkinson's disease, whereas USP13 knockdown via shRNA reduces alpha-synuclein levels in animal models. We studied the role of USP13 in knockout mice expressing lentiviral human alpha-synuclein and investigated the impact of a small molecule inhibitor of USP13, BK50118-C, on alpha-synuclein pathology and animal behavior. Alpha-synuclein was expressed unilaterally in substantia nigra (SN) of USP13 deficient mice that were treated with a daily intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg BK50118-C or DMSO for four consecutive weeks, and behavioral and functional assays were performed. Wild-type USP13<sup>+/+</sup> mice expressing lentiviral human alpha-synuclein showed motor and behavioral defects that were not seen in partially (USP13<sup>+/-</sup>) or completely (USP13<sup>-/-</sup>) deficient USP13 mice. BK50118-C displayed a wide and favorable therapeutic dose range in vivo. Treatment with BK50118-C significantly reduced ubiquitinated alpha-synuclein, increased dopamine levels, and improved motor and behavioral symptoms in wild-type (USP13<sup>+/+</sup>), but not USP13 deficient, mice. These data suggest that USP13 is critical to the neuropathology of alpha-synuclein, whereas a novel small molecule inhibitor of USP13 is a potential therapeutic agent of alpha-synucleinopathies.",2022-07-23
35894141,Cryptotanshinone suppresses tumorigenesis by inhibiting lipogenesis and promoting reactive oxygen species production in KRAS‑activated pancreatic cancer cells.,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) is an important regulator of energy metabolism. Previously, knockdown of PDK4 by specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been shown to suppress the expression of Κirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and the growth of lung and colorectal cancer cells, indicating that PDK4 is an attractive target of cancer therapy by altering energy metabolism. The authors previously reported that a novel small molecule, cryptotanshinone (CPT), which inhibits PDK4 activity, suppresses the <i>in vitro</i> three‑dimensional (3D)‑spheroid formation and <i>in vivo</i> tumorigenesis of KRAS‑activated human pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells. The present study investigated the molecular mechanism of CPT‑induced tumor suppression via alteration of glutamine and lipid metabolism in human pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines with mutant and wild‑type KRAS. The antitumor effect of CPT was more pronounced in the cancer cells containing mutant KRAS compared with those containing wild‑type KRAS. CPT treatment decreased glutamine and lipid metabolism, affected redox regulation and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the pancreatic cancer cell line MIAPaCa‑2 containing mutant KRAS. Suppression of activated KRAS by specific siRNAs decreased 3D‑spheroid formation, the expression of acetyl‑CoA carboxylase 1 and fatty acid synthase (FASN) and lipid synthesis. The suppression also reduced glutathione‑SH/glutathione disulfide and increased the production of ROS. Knockdown of FASN suppressed lipid synthesis in MIAPaCa‑2 cells, partially promoted ROS production and mildly suppressed 3D‑spheroid formation. These results indicated that CPT reduced tumorigenesis by inhibiting lipid metabolism and promoting ROS production in a mutant KRAS‑dependent manner. This PDK4 inhibitor could serve as a novel therapeutic drug for KRAS‑driven intractable cancers via alteration of cell metabolism.",2022-07-27
35889210,A Novel ERK2 Degrader Z734 Induces Apoptosis of MCF-7 Cells via the HERC3/p53 Signaling Pathway.,"Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and synthetic chemicals targeting specific proteins or various molecular pathways for tumor suppression, such as ERK inhibitors and degraders, have been intensively investigated. The targets of ERK participate in the regulation of critical cellular mechanisms and underpin the progression of anticancer therapy. In this study, we identified a novel small molecule, which we named Z734, as a new mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK2) degrader and demonstrated that Z734 inhibits cell growth by inducing p53-mediated apoptotic pathways in human breast cancer cells. Treatment with Z734 resulted in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, colony formation and migration invasion, as well as cancer cell death via apoptosis. In addition, the Co-IP and GST pulldown assays indicated that the HECT and RLD domains containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 3 (HERC3) could directly interact with ERK2 through the HECT domain, promoting ERK2 ubiquitination. We also observed a strong link between HERC3 and p53 for the modulation of apoptosis. HERC3 can increase the protein and phosphorylation levels of p53, which further promotes apoptotic activity. In a xenograft mouse model, the effect was obtained in a treatment group that combined Z734 with lapatinib compared with that of the single-treatment groups. In summary, our results indicated that Z734 actively controls the development of breast cancer through apoptosis, and HERC3 may mediate ERK2 and p53 signaling, which offers new potential targets for clinical therapy.",2022-07-06
35887136,The Insulin Receptor: An Important Target for the Development of Novel Medicines and Pesticides.,"The insulin receptor (IR) is a transmembrane protein that is activated by ligands in insulin signaling pathways. The IR has been considered as a novel therapeutic target for clinical intervention, considering the overexpression of its protein and A-isoform in multiple cancers, Alzheimer's disease, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans. Meanwhile, it may also serve as a potential target in pest management due to its multiple physiological influences in insects. In this review, we provide an overview of the structural and molecular biology of the IR, functions of IRs in humans and insects, physiological and nonpeptide small molecule modulators of the IR, and the regulating mechanisms of the IR. Xenobiotic compounds and the corresponding insecticidal chemicals functioning on the IR are also discussed. This review is expected to provide useful information for a better understanding of human IR-related diseases, as well as to facilitate the development of novel small-molecule activators and inhibitors of the IR for use as medicines or pesticides.",2022-07-14
35868561,Mechanistic insights on novel small molecule allosteric activators of cGMP-dependent protein kinase PKG1α.,"cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) represents a compelling drug target for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. PKG1 is the major effector of beneficial cGMP signaling which is involved in smooth muscle relaxation and vascular tone, inhibition of platelet aggregation and signaling that leads to cardioprotection. In this study, a novel piperidine series of activators previously identified from an ultrahigh-throughput screen were validated to directly bind partially activated PKG1α and subsequently enhance its kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Compounds from initial optimization efforts showed an ability to activate PKG1α independent of the endogenous activator, cGMP. We demonstrate these small molecule activators mimic the effect of cGMP on the kinetic parameters of PKG1α by positively modulating the K<sub>M</sub> of the peptide substrate and negatively modulating the apparent K<sub>M</sub> for ATP with increase in catalytic efficiency, k<sub>cat</sub>. In addition, these compounds also allosterically modulate the binding affinity of cGMP for PKG1α by increasing the affinity of cGMP for the high-affinity binding site (CNB-A) and decreasing the affinity of cGMP for the low-affinity binding site (CNB-B). We show the mode of action of these activators involves binding to an allosteric site within the regulatory domain, near the CNB-B binding site. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported non-cGMP mimetic small molecules shown to directly activate PKG1α. Insights into the mechanism of action of these compounds will enable future development of cardioprotective compounds that function through novel modes of action for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",2022-07-19
35866173,Development of a novel peptide aptamer that interacts with the eIF4E capped-mRNA binding site using peptide epitope linker evolution (PELE).,"Identifying new binding sites and poses that modify biological function are an important step towards drug discovery. We have identified a novel disulphide constrained peptide that interacts with the cap-binding site of eIF4E, an attractive therapeutic target that is commonly overexpressed in many cancers and plays a significant role in initiating a cancer specific protein synthesis program though binding the 5'cap (7'methyl-guanoisine) moiety found on mammalian mRNAs. The use of disulphide constrained peptides to explore intracellular biological targets is limited by their lack of cell permeability and the instability of the disulphide bond in the reducing environment of the cell, loss of which results in abrogation of binding. To overcome these challenges, the cap-binding site interaction motif was placed in a hypervariable loop on an VH domain, and then selections performed to select a molecule that could recapitulate the interaction of the peptide with the target of interest in a process termed Peptide Epitope Linker Evolution (PELE). A novel VH domain was identified that interacted with the eIF4E cap binding site with a nanomolar affinity and that could be intracellularly expressed in mammalian cells. Additionally, it was demonstrated to specifically modulate eIF4E function by decreasing cap-dependent translation and cyclin D1 expression, common effects of eIF4F complex disruption.",2022-05-19
35864415,Inhibition of the RNA Regulator HuR by SRI-42127 Attenuates Neuropathic Pain After Nerve Injury Through Suppression of Neuroinflammatory Responses.,"Microglial activation with the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, is a major driver of neuropathic pain (NP) following peripheral nerve injury. We have previously shown that the RNA binding protein, HuR, is a positive node of regulation for many of these inflammatory mediators in glia and that its chemical inhibition or genetic deletion attenuates their production. In this report, we show that systemic administration of SRI-42127, a novel small molecule HuR inhibitor, attenuates mechanical allodynia, a hallmark of NP, in the early and chronic phases after spared nerve injury in male and female mice. Flow cytometry of lumbar spinal cords in SRI-42127-treated mice shows a reduction in infiltrating macrophages and a concomitant decrease in microglial populations expressing IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and CCL2. Immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and qPCR of lumbar spinal cord tissue indicate suppression of these cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. ELISA of plasma samples in the acute phase also shows attenuation of inflammatory responses. In summary, inhibition of HuR by SRI-42127 leads to the suppression of neuroinflammatory responses and allodynia after nerve injury and represents a promising new direction in the treatment of NP.",2022-07-21
35853853,BRD9 degraders as chemosensitizers in acute leukemia and multiple myeloma.,"Bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9), an essential component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex termed ncBAF, has been established as a therapeutic target in a subset of sarcomas and leukemias. Here, we used novel small molecule inhibitors and degraders along with RNA interference to assess the dependency on BRD9 in the context of diverse hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and multiple myeloma (MM) model systems. Following depletion of BRD9 protein, AML cells undergo terminal differentiation, whereas apoptosis was more prominent in ALL and MM. RNA-seq analysis of acute leukemia and MM cells revealed both unique and common signaling pathways affected by BRD9 degradation, with common pathways including those associated with regulation of inflammation, cell adhesion, DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Degradation of BRD9 potentiated the effects of several chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapies against AML, ALL, and MM. Our findings support further development of therapeutic targeting of BRD9, alone or combined with other agents, as a novel strategy for acute leukemias and MM.",2022-07-19
35847506,Therapeutic strategies of glioblastoma (GBM): The current advances in the molecular targets and bioactive small molecule compounds.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive malignant tumor in brain neuroepithelial tumors and remains incurable. A variety of treatment options are currently being explored to improve patient survival, including small molecule inhibitors, viral therapies, cancer vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies. Among them, the unique advantages of small molecule inhibitors have made them a focus of attention in the drug discovery of glioblastoma. Currently, the most used chemotherapeutic agents are small molecule inhibitors that target key dysregulated signaling pathways in glioblastoma, including receptor tyrosine kinase, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, DNA damage response, TP53 and cell cycle inhibitors. This review analyzes the therapeutic benefit and clinical development of novel small molecule inhibitors discovered as promising anti-glioblastoma agents by the related targets of these major pathways. Meanwhile, the recent advances in temozolomide resistance and drug combination are also reviewed. In the last part, due to the constant clinical failure of targeted therapies, this paper reviewed the research progress of other therapeutic methods for glioblastoma, to provide patients and readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment landscape of glioblastoma.",2021-12-31
35841928,A small molecule toll-like receptor antagonist rescues α-synuclein fibril pathology.,"The propagation and accumulation of pathological α-synuclein protein is thought to underlie the clinical symptoms of the neurodegenerative movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD). Consequently, there is significant interest in identifying the mechanisms that contribute to α-synuclein pathology, as these may inform therapeutic targets for the treatment of PD. One protein that appears to contribute to α-synuclein pathology is the innate immune pathogen recognition receptor, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). TLR2 is expressed on neurons, and its activation results in the accumulation of α-synuclein protein; however, the precise mechanism by which TLR2 contributes to α-synuclein pathology is unclear. Herein we demonstrate using human cell models that neuronal TLR2 activation acutely impairs the autophagy lysosomal pathway and markedly potentiates α-synuclein pathology seeded with α-synuclein preformed fibrils. Moreover, α-synuclein pathology could be ameliorated with a novel small molecule TLR2 inhibitor, including in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from a patient with PD. These results provide further insight into how TLR2 activation may promote α-synuclein pathology in PD and support that TLR2 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.",2022-07-13
35841781,"Identification of a novel immune-inflammatory signature of COVID-19 infections, and evaluation of pharmacokinetics and therapeutic potential of RXn-02, a novel small-molecule derivative of quinolone.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and respiratory infection that has enormous damage to human lives and economies. It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), a non-pair-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. With increasing global threats and few therapeutic options, the discovery of new potential drug targets and the development of new therapy candidates against COVID-19 are urgently needed. Based on these premises, we conducted an analysis of transcriptomic datasets from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and identified several SARS-CoV-2 infection signatures, among which TNFRSF5/PTPRC/IDO1/MKI67 appeared to be the most pertinent signature. Subsequent integrated bioinformatics analysis identified the signature as an important immunomodulatory and inflammatory signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was suggested that this gene signature mediates the interplay of immune and immunosuppressive cells leading to infiltration-exclusion of effector memory T cells in the lungs, which is of translation relevance for developing novel SARS-CoV-2 drug and vaccine candidates. Consequently, we designed and synthesized a novel small-molecule quinoline derivative (RXn-02) and evaluated its pharmacokinetics in rats, revealing a peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) of 1.756 μg/mL and 0.6 h, respectively. Values of the area under the curve (AUC) (0-24 h) and AUC (0 h∼∞) were 18.90 and 71.20 μg h/mL, respectively. Drug absorption from the various regional segments revealed that the duodenum (49.84%), jejunum (47.885%), cecum (1.82%), and ileum (0.32%) were prime sites of RXn-02 absorption. No absorption was detected from the stomach, and the least was from the colon (0.19%). Interestingly, RXn-02 exhibited in vitro antiproliferative activities against hub gene hyper-expressing cell lines; A549 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 48.1 μM), K-562 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 100 μM), and MCF7 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.047 μM) and against five cell lines originating from human lungs (IC<sub>50</sub> range of 33.2-69.5 μM). In addition, RXn-02 exhibited high binding efficacies for targeting the TNFRSF5/PTPRC/IDO1/MK signature with binding affinities (ΔG) of -6.6, -6.0, -9.9, -6.9 kcal/mol respectively. In conclusion, our study identified a novel signature of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. RXn-02 is a drug-like candidate with good in vivo pharmacokinetics and hence possesses great translational relevance worthy of further preclinical and clinical investigations for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections.",2022-07-11
35839629,An inhibitor of interaction between the transcription factor NRF2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase adapter β-TrCP delivers anti-inflammatory responses in mouse liver.,"It is widely accepted that activating the transcription factor NRF2 will blast the physiological anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which will help combat pathologic inflammation. Much effort is being put in inhibiting the main NRF2 repressor, KEAP1, with either electrophilic small molecules or disrupters of the KEAP1/NRF2 interaction. However, targeting β-TrCP, the non-canonical repressor of NRF2, has not been considered yet. After in silico screening of ∼1 million compounds, we now describe a novel small molecule, PHAR, that selectively inhibits the interaction between β-TrCP and the phosphodegron in transcription factor NRF2. PHAR upregulates NRF2-target genes such as Hmox1, Nqo1, Gclc, Gclm and Aox1, in a KEAP1-independent, but β-TrCP dependent manner, breaks the β-TrCP/NRF2 interaction in the cell nucleus, and inhibits the β-TrCP-mediated in vitro ubiquitination of NRF2. PHAR attenuates hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress and, in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages, it downregulates the expression of inflammatory genes Il1b, Il6, Cox2, Nos2. In mice, PHAR selectively targets the liver and greatly attenuates LPS-induced liver inflammation as indicated by a reduction in the gene expression of the inflammatory cytokines Il1b, TNf, and Il6, and in F4/80-stained liver resident macrophages. Thus, PHAR offers a still unexplored alternative to current NRF2 activators by acting as a β-TrCP/NRF2 interaction inhibitor that may have a therapeutic value against undesirable inflammation.",2022-07-11
35835842,"Design, characterization and structure-function analysis of novel antimicrobial peptides based on the N-terminal CATH-2 fragment.","The emergence of multidrug resistance coupled with shrinking antibiotic pipelines has increased the demand of antimicrobials with novel mechanisms of action. Therefore, researchers across the globe are striving to develop new antimicrobial substances to alleviate the pressure on conventional antibiotic therapies. Host-Defence Peptides (HDPs) and their derivatives are emerging as effective therapeutic agents against microbial resistance. In this study, five analogs (DP1-5) of the N-terminal (N-15) fragment of CATH-2 were designed based on the delicate balance between various physicochemical properties such as charge, aliphatic character, amphipathicity and hydrophobicity. By means of in-silico and in-vitro studies a novel peptide (DP1) with the sequence ""RFGRFLRKILRFLKK"" was found to be more effective and less toxic than the N-terminal CATH-2 peptide. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry were applied for structural insights. Antimicrobial, haemolytic, and cytotoxic activities were also assessed. The resulting peptide was characterized by low cytotoxicity, low haemolytic activity, and efficient anti-microbial activity. Structurally, it displayed strong helical properties irrespective of the solvent environment and was stable in membrane-mimicking environments. Taken together, the data suggests that DP1 can be explored as a promising therapeutic agent with possible clinical applications.",2022-07-14

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are also considered promising targets for the development of effective therapies against skin wounds. However, further research in this field is anticipated. This study aims to identify and provide a new peptide drug candidate, as well as to explore the underlying miRNA mechanisms and possible miRNA drug target for skin wound healing.",2022-07-12
35819845,Discovery and Characterization of a Novel Allosteric Small-Molecule Inhibitor of NADP<sup>+</sup>-Dependent Malic Enzyme 1.,"NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent malic enzyme 1 (ME1) decarboxylates malate to form pyruvate and NADPH in the cytoplasm, where it mediates diverse biological functions related to the generation of lipids and other cellular building blocks. As such, ME1 has been implicated in the progression of cancers and has received attention as a promising drug target. Here we report the identification of a novel small-molecule inhibitor of ME1, designated AS1134900. AS1134900 is highly selective for ME1 compared with ME2 and uncompetitively inhibits ME1 activity in the presence of its substrates NADP<sup>+</sup> and malate. In addition, X-ray crystal structure analysis of the enzyme-inhibitor complex revealed that AS1134900 binds outside the ME1 active site in a novel allosteric site. Structural comparison of the ME1 quaternary complex with AS1134900, NADPH, and Mn<sup>2+</sup>, alongside known crystal structures of malic enzymes, indicated the determined crystal ME1-inhibitor complex is in the open form conformation. These results provide insights and a starting point for further discovery of drugs that inhibit ME1 activity in cancer cells.",2022-07-12

35797142,Simulations of Pathogenic E1α Variants: Allostery and Impact on Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex-E1 Structure and Function.,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency is a major cause of primary lactic acidemia resulting in high morbidity and mortality, with limited therapeutic options. The E1 component of the mitochondrial multienzyme PDC (PDC-E1) is a symmetric dimer of heterodimers (αβ/α'β') encoded by the <i>PDHA1</i> and <i>PDHB</i> genes, with two symmetric active sites each consisting of highly conserved phosphorylation loops A and B. <i>PDHA1</i> mutations are responsible for 82-88% of cases. Greater than 85% of E1α residues with disease-causing missense mutations (DMMs) are solvent-inaccessible, with ∼30% among those involved in subunit-subunit interface contact (SSIC). We performed molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type (WT) PDC-E1 and E1 variants with E1α DMMs at R349 and W185 (residues involved in SSIC), to investigate their impact on human PDC-E1 structure. We evaluated the change in E1 structure and dynamics and examined their implications on E1 function with the specific DMMs. We found that the dynamics of phosphorylation Loop A, which is crucial for E1 biological activity, changes with DMMs that are at least about 15 Å away. Because communication is essential for PDC-E1 activity (with alternating active sites), we also investigated the possible communication network within WT PDC-E1 via centrality analysis. We observed that DMMs altered/disrupted the communication network of PDC-E1. Collectively, these results indicate allosteric effect in PDC-E1, with implications for the development of novel small-molecule therapeutics for specific recurrent E1α DMMs such as replacements of R349 responsible for ∼10% of PDC deficiency due to E1α DMMs.",2022-07-07
35794816,Targeting cancer stemness mediated by BMI1 and MCL1 for non-small cell lung cancer treatment.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death, with a global 5-year survival rate <20%. Early metastasis and recurrence remain major challenges for lung cancer treatment. The stemness property of cancer cells has been suggested to play a key role in cancer plasticity, metastasis and drug-resistance, and is a potential target for drug development. In this study, we found that in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BMI1 and MCL1 play crucial roles of cancer stemness including invasion, chemo-resistance and tumour initiation. JNK signalling serves as a link between oncogenic pathway or genotoxicity to cancer stemness. The activation of JNK, either by mutant EGFR or chemotherapy agent, stabilized BMI1 and MCL1 proteins through suppressing the expression of E3-ubiquitin ligase HUWE1. In lung cancer patient samples, high level of BMI1 is correlated with poor survival, and the expression of BMI1 is positively correlated with MCL1. A novel small-molecule, BI-44, was developed, which effectively suppressed BMI1/MCL1 expressions and inhibited tumour formation and progression in preclinical models. Targeting cancer stemness mediated by BMI1/MCL1 with BI-44 provides the basis for a new therapeutic approach in NSCLC treatment.",2022-07-06
35774785,"RG100204, A Novel Aquaporin-9 Inhibitor, Reduces Septic Cardiomyopathy and Multiple Organ Failure in Murine Sepsis.","Sepsis is caused by systemic infection and is a major health concern as it is the primary cause of death from infection. It is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and there are no specific effective treatments for sepsis. Gene deletion of the neutral solute channel Aquaporin 9 (AQP9) normalizes oxidative stress and improves survival in a bacterial endotoxin induced mouse model of sepsis. In this study we described the initial characterization and effects of a novel small molecule AQP9 inhibitor, RG100204, in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced model of polymicrobial infection. <i>In vitro</i>, RG100204 blocked mouse AQP9 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> permeability in an ectopic CHO cell expression system and abolished the LPS induced increase in superoxide anion and nitric oxide in FaO hepatoma cells. Pre-treatment of CLP-mice with RG100204 (25 mg/kg p.o. before CLP and then again at 8 h after CLP) attenuated the hypothermia, cardiac dysfunction (systolic and diastolic), renal dysfunction and hepatocellular injury caused by CLP-induced sepsis. Post-treatment of CLP-mice with RG100204 also attenuated the cardiac dysfunction (systolic and diastolic), the renal dysfunction caused by CLP-induced sepsis, but did not significantly reduce the liver injury or hypothermia. The most striking finding was that oral administration of RG100204 as late as 3 h after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis attenuated the cardiac and renal dysfunction caused by severe sepsis. Immunoblot quantification demonstrated that RG100204 reduced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Moreover, myeloperoxidase activity in RG100204 treated lung tissue was reduced. Together these results indicate that AQP9 may be a novel drug target in polymicrobial sepsis.",2022-06-14
35768626,Vaccination against connective tissue growth factor attenuates the development of renal fibrosis.,"There is a critical need for efficient treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renal fibrosis is a final common pathway to end-stage renal disease independent of the underlying etiology, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a well-recognized profibrotic factor in fibrosis of various organ systems. Here, we developed a novel peptide vaccine against CTGF to attenuate the development of renal fibrosis. Three inoculations with this CTGF vaccine at 2-week intervals elicited antibodies specifically binding to human full-length CTGF, and the antigen-specific serum IgG antibody titers were maintained for > 30 weeks. The efficacy of the CTGF vaccine on renal fibrosis was evaluated in adenine-induced CKD and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) murine models. In adenine-induced CKD model, immunization with the CTGF vaccine attenuated renal interstitial fibrosis. Vaccinated mice showed low levels of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen and low urine albumin-creatinine ratio compared with vehicle-treated mice. In UUO model, the CTGF vaccination also suppressed the onset of renal fibrosis. In an in vitro study, CTGF vaccine-elicited IgG antibodies efficiently suppressed CTGF-induced- and transforming growth factor-β-induced α-smooth muscle actin expression in kidney fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that the CTGF vaccine is a promising strategy to attenuate the development of renal fibrosis.",2022-06-29

In the absence of specific antivirals or vaccines, it is essential to continue efforts to develop effective anti-CHIKV strategies. Our previous study showing the <i>in vitro</i> anti-CHIKV potential of a novel molecule 1-[(2-methylbenzimidazol-1-yl) methyl]-2-oxo-indolin-3-ylidene] amino] thiourea (MBZM-N-IBT) encouraged us to further validate its efficacy. Here, the effect of MBZM-N-IBT was evaluated <i>in vitro</i> in RAW 264.7 cells, <i>in vivo</i> in C57BL/6 mice, and <i>ex vivo</i> in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). The study demonstrated that CHIKV infection was efficiently abrogated in RAW 264.7 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 22.34 μM) with significant inhibition in viral proteins. The inhibition was effective in the postentry step, and MBZM-N-IBT predominately interfered in the early stages of CHIKV life cycle. It was further supported when the protease activity of CHIKV-nsP2 was hindered by the compound. Moreover, it diminished the CHIKV-induced inflammatory responses <i>in vitro</i> through significant downregulation of all the major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), NF-κB, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and cytokines. Furthermore, MBZM-N-IBT restricted CHIKV infection and inflammation <i>in vivo</i>, leading to reduced clinical scores and complete survival of C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, it has been noticed that the CHIKV infection was reduced remarkably in hPBMC-derived monocyte-macrophage populations <i>ex vivo</i> by the compound. In conclusion, it can be suggested that this novel compound MBZM-N-IBT has been demonstrated to be a potential anti-CHIKV molecule <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, and <i>ex vivo</i> and fulfilled all the criteria to investigate further for successful treatment of CHIKV infection.",2022-06-29
35743155,A Novel Triple-Action Inhibitor Targeting B-Cell Receptor Signaling and BRD4 Demonstrates Preclinical Activity in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results from intrinsic genetic defects and complex microenvironment stimuli that fuel CLL cell growth through an array of survival signaling pathways. Novel small-molecule agents targeting the B-cell receptor pathway and anti-apoptotic proteins alone or in combination have revolutionized the management of CLL, yet combination therapy carries significant toxicity and CLL remains incurable due to residual disease and relapse. Single-molecule inhibitors that can target multiple disease-driving factors are thus an attractive approach to combat both drug resistance and combination-therapy-related toxicities. We demonstrate that SRX3305, a novel small-molecule BTK/PI3K/BRD4 inhibitor that targets three distinctive facets of CLL biology, attenuates CLL cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. SRX3305 also inhibits the activation-induced proliferation of primary CLL cells in vitro and effectively blocks microenvironment-mediated survival signals, including stromal cell contact. Furthermore, SRX3305 blocks CLL cell migration toward CXCL-12 and CXCL-13, which are major chemokines involved in CLL cell homing and retention in microenvironment niches. Importantly, SRX3305 maintains its anti-tumor effects in ibrutinib-resistant CLL cells. Collectively, this study establishes the preclinical efficacy of SRX3305 in CLL, providing significant rationale for its development as a therapeutic agent for CLL and related disorders.",2022-06-16
35740884,"Discovery of a Novel Antimicrobial Peptide, Temporin-PKE, from the Skin Secretion of <i>Pelophylax kl. esculentus</i>, and Evaluation of Its Structure-Activity Relationships.","Bacterial resistance against antibiotics has led to increasing numbers of treatment failures, and AMPs are widely accepted as becoming potential alternatives due to their advantages. Temporin-PKE is a novel peptide extracted from the skin secretion of <i>Pelophylax kl. esculentus</i> and it displays a strong activity against Gram-positive bacteria, with an extreme cytotoxicity. Incorporating positively charged residues and introducing D-amino acids were the two main strategies adopted for the modifications. The transformation of the chirality of Ile could reduce haemolytic activity, and an analogue with appropriate D-isoforms could maintain antimicrobial activity and stability. The substitution of hydrophobic residues could bring about more potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities. The analogues with Lys were less harmful to the normal cells and their stabilities remained at similarly high levels compared to temporin-PKE. The optimal number of charges was three, and the replacement on the polar face was a better choice. Temporin-PKE-3K exerted dually efficient functions includingstrong antimicrobial and anticancer activity. This analogue showed a reduced possibility for inducing resistance in MRSA and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, a rather strong antimicrobial activity in vivo, and it exhibited the highest therapeutic index such that temporin-PKE-3K has the potential to be developed as a clinical drug.",2022-05-29
35736307,Translocating Peptides of Biomedical Interest Obtained from the Spike (S) Glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2.,"At the beginning of 2020, the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to the fast sequencing of its genome to facilitate molecular engineering strategies to control the pathogen's spread. The spike (S) glycoprotein has been identified as the leading therapeutic agent due to its role in localizing the ACE2 receptor in the host's pulmonary cell membrane, binding, and eventually infecting the cells. Due to the difficulty of delivering bioactive molecules to the intracellular space, we hypothesized that the S protein could serve as a source of membrane translocating peptides. AHB-1, AHB-2, and AHB-3 peptides were identified and analyzed on a membrane model of DPPC (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An umbrella sampling approach was used to quantify the energy barrier necessary to cross the boundary (13.2 to 34.9 kcal/mol), and a flat-bottom pulling helped to gain a deeper understanding of the membrane's permeation dynamics. Our studies revealed that the novel peptide AHB-1 exhibited comparable penetration potential of already known potent cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) such as TP2, Buforin II, and Frenatin 2.3s. Results were confirmed by in vitro analysis of the peptides conjugated to chitosan nanoparticles, demonstrating its ability to reach the cytosol and escape endosomes, while maintaining high biocompatibility levels according to standardized assays.",2022-06-10
35735359,Discovering Novel Small Molecule Compound for Prevention of Monoclonal Antibody Self-Association.,"Designing an antibody with the desired affinity to the antigen is challenging, often achieved by lengthening the hydrophobic CDRs, which can lead to aggregation and cause major hindrance to the development of successful biopharmaceutical products. Aggregation can cause immunogenicity, viscosity and stability issues affecting both the safety and quality of the product. As the hydrophobic residues on the CDR are required for direct binding to antigens, it is not always possible to substitute these residues for aggregation-reduction purposes. Therefore, discovery of specific excipients to prevent aggregation is highly desirable for formulation development. Here, we used a combination of in silico screening methods to identify aggregation-prone regions on an aggregation-prone therapeutic antibody. The most aggregation-prone region on the antibody was selected to conduct virtual screening of compounds that can bind to such regions and act as an aggregation breaker. The most promising excipient candidate was further studied alongside plain buffer formulations and formulations with trehalose using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations with MARTINI force field. Mean interaction value between two antibody molecules in each formulation was calculated based on 1024 replicates of 512 ns of such CGMD simulations. Corresponding formulations with an excipient:antibody ratio of 1:5 were compared experimentally by measuring the diffusion interaction parameter <i>k<sub>D</sub></i> and accelerated stability studies. Although the compound with the highest affinity score did not show any additional protective effects compared with trehalose, this study proved using a combination of in silico tools can aid excipient design and formulation development.",2022-06-08

35695407,Discovery of a Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor Disrupting TRBP-Dicer Interaction against Hepatocellular Carcinoma via the Modulation of microRNA Biogenesis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis. Therefore, small molecules targeting components of miRNA biogenesis may provide new therapeutic means for HCC treatment. By a high-throughput screening and structural simplification, we identified a small molecule, CIB-3b, which suppresses the growth and metastasis of HCC <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> by modulating expression profiles of miRNAome and proteome in HCC cells. Mechanistically, CIB-3b physically binds to transactivation response (TAR) RNA-binding protein 2 (TRBP) and disrupts the TRBP-Dicer interaction, thereby altering the activity of Dicer and mature miRNA production. Structure-activity relationship study via the synthesis of 45 CIB-3b derivatives showed that some compounds exhibited a similar inhibitory effect on miRNA biogenesis to CIB-3b. These results support TRBP as a potential therapeutic target in HCC and warrant further development of CIB-3b along with its analogues as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC.",2022-06-13
35693820,Novel Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase 2 Pseudokinase Ligands Block Cytokine-Induced TYK2-Mediated Signaling Pathways.,"A member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, Tyrosine Kinase 2 (TYK2), is crucial in mediating various cytokine-signaling pathways such as interleukin-23 (IL23), interleukin-12 (IL12) and type I Interferons (IFN) which contribute to autoimmune disorders (e.g., psoriasis, lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease). Thus, TYK2 represents an attractive target to develop small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cytokine-driven inflammatory diseases. Selective inhibition of TYK2 over other JAK isoforms is critical to achieve a favorable therapeutic index in the development of TYK2 inhibitors. However, designing small molecule inhibitors to target the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of TYK2 kinase has been challenging due to the substantial structural homology of the JAK family catalytic domains. Here, we employed an approach to target the JAK homology 2 (JH2) pseudokinase regulatory domain of the TYK2 protein. We developed a series of small-molecule TYK2 pseudokinase ligands, which suppress the TYK2 catalytic activity through allosteric regulation. The TYK2 pseudokinase-binding small molecules in this study simultaneously achieve high affinity-binding for the TYK2 JH2 domain while also affording significantly reduced affinity for the TYK2 JAK homology 1 (JH1) kinase domain. These TYK2 JH2 selective molecules, although possessing little effect on suppressing the catalytic activity of the isolated TYK2 JH1 catalytic domain in the kinase assays, can still significantly block the TYK2-mediated receptor-stimulated pathways by binding to the TYK2 JH2 domain and allosterically regulating the TYK2 JH1 kinase. These compounds are potent towards human T-cell lines and primary immune cells as well as in human whole-blood specimens. Moreover, TYK2 JH2-binding ligands exhibit remarkable selectivity of TYK2 over JAK isoforms not only biochemically but also in a panel of receptor-stimulated JAK1/JAK2/JAK3-driven cellular functional assays. In addition, the TYK2 JH2-targeting ligands also demonstrate high selectivity in a multi-kinase screening panel. The data in the current study underscores that the TYK2 JH2 pseudokinase is a promising therapeutic target for achieving a high degree of biological selectivity. Meanwhile, targeting the JH2 domain represents an appealing strategy for the development of clinically well-tolerated TYK2 inhibitors that would have superior efficacy and a favorable safety profile compared to the existing Janus kinase inhibitors against autoimmune diseases.",2022-05-20
35693775,SAPHO Syndrome Complicated by Ankylosing Spondylitis Successfully Treated With Tofacitinib: A Case Report.,"Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, a type of chronic inflammatory disease, is rare and difficult to treat. Osteoarthropathy with skin involvement is the primary clinical manifestation of SAPHO syndrome. The unknown pathogenesis of SAPHO syndrome is speculated to be related to individual genetic differences, immune levels, microorganisms, and environmental factors. Tofacitinib, a novel small-molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. However, it also has great potential for the treatment of other immune diseases, including SAPHO syndrome. A 36-year-old man with chest and back pain for more than two months was admitted to our hospital. After admission, the patient developed a pustular rash and enteritis. SAPHO syndrome was diagnosed based on the above clinical manifestations, computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy findings. Notably, the patient also had ankylosing spondylitis. Tofacitinib significantly improved the patient's skin symptoms while preventing worsening of chest and back pain when adalimumab was discontinued. We report the first case of ankylosing spondylitis with SAPHO syndrome. In addition, it is also the first successful treatment thereof with tofacitinib. We hope to provide valuable information regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of SAPHO syndrome in this case.",2022-05-25
35688710,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by potent peptides designed by the mutation of ACE2 binding region.,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in millions of deaths. Despite all attempts that have been made to combat the pandemic, the re-emergence of new variants complicated SARS-CoV-2 eradication. The ongoing global spread of COVID-19 demands the incessant development of novel agents in vaccination, diagnosis, and therapeutics. Targeting receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein by which the virus identifies host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), is a promising strategy for curbing viral infection. This study aims to discover novel peptide inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 entry using computational approaches. The RBD binding domain of ACE2 was extracted and docked against the RBD. MMPBSA calculations revealed the binding energies of each residue in the template. The residues with unfavorable binding energies were considered as mutation spots by OSPREY. Binding energies of the residues in RBD-ACE2 interface was determined by molecular docking. Peptide inhibitors were designed by the mutation of RBD residues in the virus-receptors complex which had unfavorable energies. Peptide tendency for RBD binding, safety, and allergenicity were the criteria based on which the final hits were screened among the initial library. Molecular dynamics simulations also provided information on the mechanisms of inhibitory action in peptides. The results were finally validated by molecular docking simulations to make sure the peptides are capable of hindering virus-host interaction. Our results introduce three peptides P7 (RAWTFLDKFNHEAEDLRYQSSLASWN), P13 (RASTFLDKFNHEAEDLRYQSSLASWN), and P19 (RADTFLDKFNHEAEDLRYQSSLASWN) as potential effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry which could be considered in drug development for COVID-19 treatment.",2022-05-17
35680376,"Cardioprotective Effects of 1-(3,6-Dibromo-carbazol-9-yl)-3-Phenylamino-Propan-2-Ol in Diabetic Hearts via Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Activation.","Diabetes is associated with increased cardiac injury and sudden death. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) is an essential enzyme for the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway and is dysregulated in diabetes. Nampt activation results in rescued NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios and provides pharmacological changes necessary for diabetic cardioprotection. Computer docking shows that 1-(3,6-Dibromo-carbazol-9-yl)-3-phenylamino-propan-2-ol (P7C3) allows for enhanced Nampt dimerization and association. To test the pharmacological application, we used male leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice and treated them with Nampt activator P7C3. The effects of 4-week P7C3 treatment on cardiac function were evaluated along with molecular signaling changes for phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT), phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The cardiac function evaluated by ECG and echocardiography were significantly improved after 4 weeks of P7C3 treatment. Biochemically, higher NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios in diabetic hearts were rescued by P7C3 treatment. Moreover, activities of Nampt and SIRT1 were significantly increased in P7C3-treated diabetic hearts. P7C3 treatment significantly decreased the blood glucose in diabetic mice with 4-week treatment as noted by glucose tolerance test and fasting blood glucose measurements compared with vehicle-treated mice. P7C3 activated Nampt enzymatic activity both in vitro and in the 4-week diabetic mouse hearts, demonstrating the specificity of the small molecule. P7C3 treatment significantly enhanced the expression of cardioprotective signaling of p-AKT, p-eNOS, and Beclin 1 in diabetic hearts. Nampt activator P7C3 allows for decreased infarct size with decreased Troponin I and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) release, which is beneficial to the heart. Overall, the present study shows that P7C3 activates Nampt and SIRT1 activity and decreases NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, resulting in improved biochemical signaling providing cardioprotection. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study shows that 1-(3,6-Dibromo-carbazol-9-yl)-3-phenylamino-propan-2-ol (P7C3) is effective in treating diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The novel small molecule is antiarrhythmic and improves the ejection fraction in diabetic hearts. The study successfully demonstrated that P7C3 decreases the infarct size in hearts during myocardial infarction and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Biochemical and cellular signaling show increased NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, along with Nampt activity involved in upregulating protective signaling in the diabetic heart. P7C3 has high therapeutic potential for rescuing heart disease.",2022-06-09
35679718,"A011, a novel small-molecule ligand of σ<sub>2</sub> receptor, potently suppresses breast cancer progression via endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy.","Breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer to become the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. Sigma-2 (σ<sub>2</sub>) receptor is considered to be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer because of its high expression in breast cancer cells and low expression in normal breast cells. Many σ<sub>2</sub> ligands have been reported to have excellent anticancer activity, but their mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. We discovered that A011 had high affinity and selectivity for σ<sub>2</sub> receptor, reduced proliferation in five cancer cell lines, and significantly inhibited the monoclonal formation ability of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, A011 rapidly increased the levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species and induced autophagy. Molecular pharmacology studies revealed that A011 induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, activated the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP pathway and inhibited the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, leading to cell apoptosis. In an in vivo tumor model, A011 showed obvious anti-tumor activity and no significant toxicity. More importantly, our study demonstrated for the first time that endoplasmic reticulum stress is the main mechanism of anti-cancer effects for σ<sub>2</sub> ligands, at least for A011. A011 may potentially be useful as a therapeutic agent for treating breast cancer.",2022-06-06
35679646,Bimodal liquid biopsy for cancer immunotherapy based on peptide engineering and nanoscale analysis.,"Despite its high potential, PD-L1 expressed by tumors has not been successfully utilized as a biomarker for estimating treatment responses to immunotherapy. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor-derived exosomes that express PD-L1 can potentially be used as biomarkers; however, currently available assays lack clinically significant sensitivity and specificity. Here, a novel peptide-based capture surface is developed to effectively isolate PD-L1-expressing CTCs and exosomes from human blood. For the effective targeting of PD-L1, this study integrates peptide engineering strategies to enhance the binding strength and specificity of a β-hairpin peptide derived from PD-1 (pPD-1). Specifically, this study examines the effect of poly(ethylene glycol) spacers, the secondary peptide structure, and modification of peptide sequences (e.g., removal of biologically redundant amino acid residues) on capture efficiency. The optimized pPD-1 configuration captures PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and tumor-derived exosomes with 1.5-fold (p = 0.016) and 1.2-fold (p = 0.037) higher efficiencies, respectively, than their whole antibody counterpart (aPD-L1). This enhanced efficiency is translated into more clinically significant detection of CTCs (1.9-fold increase; p = 0.035) and exosomes (1.5-fold increase; p = 0.047) from patients' baseline samples, demonstrating stronger correlation with patients' treatment responses. Additionally, we confirmed that the clinical accuracy of our system can be further improved by co-analyzing the two biomarkers (bimodal CTC/exosome analysis). These data demonstrate that pPD-1-based capture is a promising approach for capturing PD-L1-expressing CTCs and exosomes, which can be used as a reliable biomarker for cancer immunotherapy.",2022-06-01

35662712,A Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor of SREBP-1 Based on Natural Product Monomers Upregulates the Sensitivity of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells to Antitumor Drugs.,"The transcription factor, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), plays important roles in modulating the proliferation, metastasis, or resistance to antitumor agents by promoting cellular lipid metabolism and related cellular glucose-uptake/Warburg Effect. However, the underlying mechanism of SREBP-1 regulating the proliferation or drug-resistance in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and the therapeutic strategies targeted to SREBP-1 in LUSC remain unclear. In this study, SREBP-1 was highly expressed in LUSC tissues, compared with the paired non-tumor tissues (the para-tumor tissues). A novel small-molecule inhibitor of SREBP-1, MSI-1 (Ma's inhibitor of SREBP-1), based on natural product monomers, was identified by screening the database of natural products. Treatment with MSI-1 suppressed the activation of SREBP-1-related pathways and the Warburg effect of LUSC cells, as indicated by decreased glucose uptake or glycolysis. Moreover, treatment of MSI-1 enhanced the sensitivity of LUSC cells to antitumor agents. The specificity of MSI-1 on SREBP-1 was confirmed by molecular docking and point-mutation of SPEBP-1. Therefore, MSI-1 improved our understanding of SREBP-1 and provided additional options for the treatment of LUSC.",2022-05-18
35655109,Non-invasive Imaging of Antisense Oligonucleotides in the Brain via In Vivo Click Chemistry.,"The treatment of complex neurological diseases often requires the administration of large therapeutic drugs, such as antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), by lumbar puncture into the intrathecal space in order to bypass the blood-brain barrier. Despite the growing number of ASOs in clinical development, there are still uncertainties regarding their dosing, primarily around their distribution and kinetics in the brain following intrathecal injection. The challenge of taking measurements within the delicate structures of the central nervous system (CNS) necessitates the use of non-invasive nuclear imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, an emergent strategy known as ""pretargeted imaging"" is applied to image the distribution of an ASO in the brain by developing a novel PET tracer, [<sup>18</sup>F]F-537-Tz.

35653613,Retro Drug Design: From Target Properties to Molecular Structures.,"To deliver more therapeutics to more patients more quickly and economically is the ultimate goal of pharmaceutical researchers. The advent and rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), in combination with other powerful computational methods in drug discovery, makes this goal more practical than ever before. Here, we describe a new strategy, retro drug design, or RDD, to create novel small-molecule drugs from scratch to meet multiple predefined requirements, including biological activity against a drug target and optimal range of physicochemical and ADMET properties. The molecular structure was represented by an atom typing based molecular descriptor system, optATP, which was further transformed to the space of loading vectors from principal component analysis. Traditional predictive models were trained over experimental data for the target properties using optATP and shallow machine learning methods. The Monte Carlo sampling algorithm was then utilized to find the solutions in the space of loading vectors that have the target properties. Finally, a deep learning model was employed to decode molecular structures from the solutions. To test the feasibility of the algorithm, we challenged RDD to generate novel kinase inhibitors from random numbers with five different ADMET properties optimized at the same time. The best Tanimoto similarity score between the generated valid structures and the available 4,314 kinase inhibitors was < 0.50, indicating a high extent of novelty of the generated compounds. From the 3,040 structures that met all six target properties, 20 were selected for synthesis and experimental measurement of inhibition activity over 97 representative kinases and the ADMET properties. Fifteen and eight compounds were determined to be hits or strong hits, respectively. Five of the six strong kinase inhibitors have excellent experimental ADMET properties. The results presented in this paper illustrate that RDD has the potential to significantly improve the current drug discovery process.",2022-06-02

A method for quantitation of IOA-289 in human plasma was developed using a stable isotope labeled compound ([<sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>]IOA-289) as internal standard. The analytes were extracted from human plasma by protein precipitation and the analysis was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LCMS/MS). The chromatographic separation was performed with a gradient elution from a BEH C18 column and under these conditions the retention time and the run time were 1 and 2 min, respectively.

35631512,IL-13Rα2 Status Predicts GB-13 (IL13.E13K-PE4E) Efficacy in High-Grade Glioma.,"High-grade gliomas (HGG) are devastating diseases in children and adults. In the pediatric population, diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) harboring H3K27 alterations are the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumors. With no effective therapies available, children typically succumb to disease within one year of diagnosis. In adults, glioblastoma (GBM) remains largely intractable, with a median survival of approximately 14 months despite standard clinical care of radiation and temozolomide. Therefore, effective therapies for these tumors remain one of the most urgent and unmet needs in modern medicine. Interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL-13Rα2) is a cell-surface transmembrane protein upregulated in many HGGs, including DMG and adult GBM, posing a potentially promising therapeutic target for these tumors. In this study, we investigated the pharmacological effects of GB-13 (also known as IL13.E13K-PE4E), a novel peptide-toxin conjugate that contains a targeting moiety designed to bind IL-13Rα2 with high specificity and a point-mutant cytotoxic domain derived from Pseudomonas exotoxin A. Glioma cell lines demonstrated a spectrum of IL-13Rα2 expression at both the transcript and protein level. Anti-tumor effects of GB-13 strongly correlated with IL-13Rα2 expression and were reflected in apoptosis induction and decreased cell proliferation in vitro. Direct intratumoral administration of GB-13 via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) significantly decreased tumor burden and resulted in prolonged survival in IL-13Rα2-upregulated orthotopic xenograft models of HGG. In summary, administration of GB-13 demonstrated a promising pharmacological response in HGG models both in vitro and in vivo in a manner strongly associated with IL-13Rα2 expression, underscoring the potential of this IL-13Rα2-targeted therapy in a subset of HGG with increased IL-13Rα2 levels.",2022-04-24
35628342,Pan-Lysyl Oxidase Inhibitor PXS-5505 Ameliorates Multiple-Organ Fibrosis by Inhibiting Collagen Crosslinks in Rodent Models of Systemic Sclerosis.,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterised by progressive multiple organ fibrosis leading to morbidity and mortality. Lysyl oxidases play a vital role in the cross-linking of collagens and subsequent build-up of fibrosis in the extracellular matrix. As such, their inhibition provides a novel treatment paradigm for SSc. A novel small molecule pan-lysyl oxidase inhibitor, PXS-5505, currently in clinical development for myelofibrosis treatment was evaluated using in vivo rodent models resembling the fibrotic conditions in SSc. Both lysyl oxidase and lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) expression were elevated in the skin and lung of SSc patients. The oral application of PXS-5505 inhibited lysyl oxidase activity in the skin and LOXL2 activity in the lung. PXS-5505 exhibited anti-fibrotic effects in the SSc skin mouse model, reducing dermal thickness and α-smooth muscle actin. Similarly, in the bleomycin-induced mouse lung model, PXS-5505 reduced pulmonary fibrosis toward normal levels, mediated by its ability to normalise collagen/elastin crosslink formation. PXS-5505 also reduced fibrotic extent in models of the ischaemia-reperfusion heart, the unilateral ureteral obstruction kidney, and the CCl4-induced fibrotic liver. PXS-5505 consistently demonstrates potent anti-fibrotic efficacy in multiple models of organ fibrosis relevant to the pathogenesis of SSc, suggesting that it may be efficacious as a novel approach for treating SSc.",2022-05-16
35618814,PepNN: a deep attention model for the identification of peptide binding sites.,"Protein-peptide interactions play a fundamental role in many cellular processes, but remain underexplored experimentally and difficult to model computationally. Here, we present PepNN-Struct and PepNN-Seq, structure and sequence-based approaches for the prediction of peptide binding sites on a protein. A main difficulty for the prediction of peptide-protein interactions is the flexibility of peptides and their tendency to undergo conformational changes upon binding. Motivated by this, we developed reciprocal attention to simultaneously update the encodings of peptide and protein residues while enforcing symmetry, allowing for information flow between the two inputs. PepNN integrates this module with modern graph neural network layers and a series of transfer learning steps are used during training to compensate for the scarcity of peptide-protein complex information. We show that PepNN-Struct achieves consistently high performance across different benchmark datasets. We also show that PepNN makes reasonable peptide-agnostic predictions, allowing for the identification of novel peptide binding proteins.",2022-05-26
35616397,"LcCCL28-25, Derived from Piscine Chemokine, Exhibits Antimicrobial Activity against Gram-Negative and Gram-Positive Bacteria <i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Vivo</i>.","Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are currently recognized as potentially promising antibiotic substitutes. Fish are an important seawater/freshwater medicinal biological resource, and the antimicrobial peptides and proteins that are key components of their innate immune systems are potential candidates for the development of novel antibacterial agents. The rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss chemokine CK11 (omCK11), classified in the C-C motif chemokine ligand 27/28 (CCL27/28) family, is the only CC-type chemokine reported to play a direct antibacterial role in the immune response; however, its antibacterial domain remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed the structure-activity relationship of omCK11 and identified the antibacterial C-terminal domain. Additionally, we performed structure-function analyses of CCL27/28 proteins from different, representative freshwater and seawater fishes, revealing their shared C-terminal antibacterial domains. Surprisingly, a synthesized cationic peptide (named lcCCL28-25), derived from the large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea CCL28, exhibited broad-spectrum and the most acceptable bactericidal activity, as well as antibiofilm activity and negligible hemolytic and cytotoxic activity <i>in vitro</i>. Additionally, lcCCL28-25 conferred a protective effect in the thighs of neutropenic mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus. SYTOX green fluorescence and electron microscopy experiments revealed that lcCCL28-25 was capable of rapidly destroying the integrity and permeability of the bacterial cell membrane. Overall, this study aided in the advancement of antibacterial CC-type chemokine research and also suggested a new strategy for exploring novel AMPs. Additionally, the efficacy of lcCCL28-25 in <i>in vivo</i> antibacterial activity in a mammalian model revealed that this compound could be a promising agent for the development of peptide-based antibacterial therapeutics. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The primary function of chemokines has been described as recruiting and activating leukocytes to participate in the immune response. Some chemokines are also broad-spectrum antibacterial proteins in mammals. The Oncorhynchus mykiss chemokine CK11 (omCK11) is the first reported and currently the only CC-type antibacterial chemokine. The present study identified the antibacterial domain of omCK11. Structure-function analysis of various fish CCL27/28 proteins identified a novel antibacterial peptide (lcCCL28-25) from Larimichthys crocea CCL28 that exhibited broad-spectrum and the most acceptable bactericidal activity <i>in vitro</i>, as well as a protective effect in a Staphylococcus aureus infection mouse model. The antibacterial mechanisms included membrane disruption and permeation. This study advanced the field of antibacterial chemokine research in fish and also suggested a new strategy for exploring novel AMPs. The novel peptide lcCCL28-25 may prove to be an effective antibacterial agent.",2022-05-26
35612819,"Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluations of DOT1L Peptide Mimetics Targeting the Protein-Protein Interactions between DOT1L and MLL-AF9/MLL-ENL.","On the basis of a previously identified DOT1L peptide mimetic (compound <b>3</b>), a series of novel peptide mimetics were designed and synthesized. These compounds can potently bind to AF9 and ENL either in cell-free binding assays or in leukemia cells, and selectively inhibit the growth of leukemia cells containing mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins. The most potent compound <b>12</b> exhibited comparable anticancer cellular activities to those of EPZ5676, a clinical stage enzymatic inhibitor of DOT1L in several leukemia cell lines containing MLL fusion proteins. Mechanism studies for compound <b>12</b> indicated that it did not affect the global methylation of H3K79 catalyzed by DOT1L but could effectively suppress the methylation of H3K79 at MLL fusion proteins targeted genes and inhibit the expressions of these genes. Our studies thus demonstrated that inhibiting the protein-protein interactions between DOT1L and MLL fusion proteins is a potentially effective strategy for the treatment of <i>MLL</i> rearranged leukemias.",2022-05-25
35610324,Antifungal Activity of NP20 Derived from Amphioxus Midkine/Pleiotrophin Homolog Against Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus.,"With the emergence of antifungal resistance, systematic infections with Aspergillus are becoming the major cause of the clinical morbidity. The development of novel antifungal agents with high efficacy, low drug tolerance, and few side effects is urgent. In response to that need, we have identified NP20. Here we demonstrate clearly that NP20 has antifungal activity, capable of killing the spores of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus as well as causing direct damage to the surface, membrane, cytoplasm, organelle, and nucleus of the fungal spores. Interestingly, NP20 is active under temperature stress and a wide range of pH. Subsequently, MTT assay, assay for binding of NP20 to fungal cell wall components, membrane depolarization assay, confocal microscopy, ROS assay, DNA replication, and protein synthesis assay are performed to clarify the mechanisms underlying NP20 against Aspergillus. The results show that NP20 can bind with and pass through the fungal cell wall, and then interfere with the lipid membrane. Moreover, NP20 can induce intracellular ROS production, DNA fragmentation, and protein synthesis inhibition of the fungal cells. These together indicate that NP20 is a novel antifungal peptide, which has considerable potential for future development as novel peptide antibiotics against Aspergillus.",2022-05-24
35604326,Peptidomimetics: An Overview of Recent Medicinal Chemistry Efforts toward the Discovery of Novel Small Molecule Inhibitors.,"The use of peptides as therapeutics has often been associated with several drawbacks such as poor absorption, low stability to proteolytic digestion, and fast clearance. Peptidomimetics are developed by modifications of native peptides with the aim of obtaining molecules that are more suitable for clinical development and, for this reason, are widely used as tools in medicinal chemistry programs. The effort to disclose innovative peptidomimetic therapies is recurrent and constantly evolving as demonstrated by the new lead compounds in clinical trials. Synthetic strategies for the development of peptidomimetics have also been implemented with time. This perspective highlights some of the most recent efforts for the design and synthesis of peptidomimetic agents together with their biological evaluation toward a panel of targets.",2022-05-23
35599721,Analysis of Therapeutic Targets of A Novel Peptide Athycaltide-1 in the Treatment of Isoproterenol-Induced Pathological Myocardial Hypertrophy.,"Myocardial hypertrophy is a pathological feature of many heart diseases. This is a complex process involving all types of cells in the heart and interactions with circulating cells. This study is aimed at identifying the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in myocardial hypertrophy rats induced by isoprenaline (ISO) and treated with novel peptide Athycaltide-1 (ATH-1) and exploring the mechanism of its improvement. ITRAQ was performed to compare the three different heart states in control group, ISO group, and ATH-1 group. Pairwise comparison showed that there were 121 DEPs in ISO/control (96 upregulated and 25 downregulated), 47 DEPs in ATH-1/ISO (27 upregulated and 20 downregulated), and 116 DEPs in ATH-1/control (77 upregulated and 39 downregulated). Protein network analysis was then performed using the STRING software. Functional analysis revealed that Hspa1 protein, oxidative stress, and MAPK signaling pathway were significantly involved in the occurrence and development of myocardial hypertrophy, which was further validated by vivo model. It is proved that ATH-1 can reduce the expression of Hspa1 protein and the level of oxidative stress in hypertrophic myocardium and further inhibit the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK1/2.",2022-05-02
35595822,"SHR1032, a novel STING agonist, stimulates anti-tumor immunity and directly induces AML apoptosis.","Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation induces type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines which stimulate tumor antigen cross presentation and the adaptive immune responses against tumor. The first-generation of STING agonists, cyclic di-nucleotide (CDN), mimicked the endogenous STING ligand cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate, and displayed limited clinical efficacy. Here we report the discovery of SHR1032, a novel small molecule non-CDN STING agonist. Compared to the clinical CDN STING agonist ADU-S100, SHR1032 has much higher activity in human cells with different STING haplotypes and robustly induces interferon β (IFNβ) production. When dosed intratumorally, SHR1032 induced strong anti-tumor effects in the MC38 murine syngeneic tumor model. Pharmacodynamic studies showed induction of IFNβ, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the tumors and, to a lower extent, in the plasma. More importantly, we found SHR1032 directly causes cell death in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that in addition to their established ability to boost anti-tumor immune responses, STING agonists can directly eradicate AML cells, and SHR1032 may present a new and promising therapeutic agent for cancer patients.",2022-05-20
35594837,An all-in-one adjuvanted therapeutic cancer vaccine targeting dendritic cell cytosol induces long-lived tumor suppression through NLRC4 inflammasome activation.,"Therapeutic cancer vaccines (TCVs) should induce robust tumor-specific T cell responses. To achieve this, TCVs incorporate T cell epitopes and strong adjuvants. Here, we report an all-in-one adjuvanted cancer vaccine platform that targets the intracellular compartment of dentritic cells and subsequently induces effective cytotoxic T cell responses. We screened a novel peptide (DCpep6) that specifically binds and transmits into CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells through a novel in vivo phage biopanning. We then engineered a protein-based TCV (DEF) consisting of DCpep6 (D), an optimized HPV E7 tumor antigen (E), and a built-in flagellin adjuvant (F) as a single molecule. DEF was stably expressed, and each component was functional. In vivo-administered DEF rapidly biodistributed in draining LNs and internalized into CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells. DEF immunization elicited strong antitumor T cell responses and provided long-term survival of TC-1 tumor-implanted mice. The DEF-mediated antitumor effect was abolished in NLRC4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Taken together, we propose a protein-based all-in-one TCV platform that intracellularly codelivers tumor antigen and inflammasome activator to DCs to induce long-lasting antitumor T cell responses.",2022-05-10
35588657,"A novel small molecule Hsp90 inhibitor, C-316-1, attenuates acute kidney injury by suppressing RIPK1-mediated inflammation and necroptosis.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is marked by a fast deterioration of the kidney function that may be caused by a variety of factors. Recently, although our group found that PPBICA alleviated programmed cell death in AKI, poor water solubility limited its bioavailability. In this research, we screened a series of derivatives and found that C-316-1 had the best suppressive effect on preventing necroptosis and inflammation in cisplatin- and ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI in vitro and in vivo with lower toxicity and better water solubility. Mass spectrometry results showed that C-316-1 bound to heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which was further confirmed by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance. Additionally, the Hsp90 expression was upregulated in the blood and tissues of AKI patients. We discovered that C-316-1 decreased the RIPK1 protein level without affecting its mRNA expression. The proteasome inhibitor, MG132 restored the level of RIPK1 reduced by C-316-1, suggesting that C-316-1 limits necroptosis by promoting the degradation of RIPK1 rather than by reducing its production. Immunoprecipitation further showed that pretreatment with C-316-1 disrupted the Hsp90-Cdc37 protein-protein Interactions (PPIs). Thereby, C-316-1 inhibited the Hsp90-Cdc37 complex formation and led to a significant decrease in RIPK1, which in turn reduced necroptosis. Moreover, C-316-1 treatment did not protect against kidney injury in vivo and in vitro when Hsp90 was knocked down and R46, E47, and S50 in Cdc37 binding site of Hsp90 might form an important active pocket with C-316-1. These findings suggest that C-316-1 is a potential therapeutic agent against RIPK1-Mediated Necroptosis in AKI.",2022-05-16
35568001,Evaluation of anti-angiogenic agent F16 for targeting glioblastoma xenograft tumors.,"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal types of all cancers, with an average 5-year survival rate of 5%. Since GBM tumors are highly vascularized tumors, and their growth is angiogenesis-dependent, antagonizing tumor angiogenesis by using angiogenesis inhibitors were considered as one of the promising approaches. In this context, intensive preclinical evaluation of a novel small molecule named F16 has exhibited potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities by selectively antagonizing Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR). Also, recent pharmacokinetic evaluation of F16 with tissue distribution analysis has shown that this molecule is transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in the brain regions with no signs of neurotoxicity. Therefore, further studies were conducted to determine the efficacy of F16 in delaying glioblastoma progression via inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Our in vitro studies have clearly demonstrated the ability of F16 to inhibit migration and invasion of U87MG cells and also confirmed a potent cytotoxic effect against these cells in comparison to Temozolomide (TMZ). Our in vivo studies with the subcutaneously implanted (s.c.) xenograft tumor model and in vitro studies have clearly demonstrated the ability of F16 to delay tumor growth and inhibit migration and invasion.",2022-04-25
35566047,Novel Small Molecule Inhibitors Targeting the IL-6/STAT3 Pathway or IL-1β.,"Development of small molecules that inhibit inflammatory cytokines is a desirable strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Following up a previous study, we synthesized 10 novel compounds with a 2,5-diaminobenzoxazole moiety and evaluated their biological activities. Among them, compound 3e showed potent inhibitory activity on Interleukin 6 (IL-6)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling inhibition (71.5%), and 3a showed excellent inhibitory activity on Interleukin 1 (IL-1β) (92.1%). To test in vivo anti-inflammatory activity, compounds 3a and 3e were administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection after subcutaneous (SC) injection of zymosan A into the right footpad of mice. Inflammation on the footpad was reduced after administration of compounds 3a and 3e. Especially, compound 3a showed a significant ameliorative effect on zymosan-induced inflammation. From the in vivo and in vitro test results, we confirmed that our synthesized compounds are effective on the RA animal model through inhibition of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Since drugs developed with small molecule inhibitors have several advantages over biological drugs, further study on these compounds is needed for the development of potent SMI drugs on RA.",2022-04-22
35547769,Polymer chimera of stapled oncolytic peptide coupled with anti-PD-L1 peptide boosts immunotherapy of colorectal cancer.,"<b>Rationale:</b> Scarce tumor mutation burden and neoantigens create tremendous obstacles for an effective immunotherapy of colorectal cancer (CRC). Oncolytic peptides rise as a promising therapeutic approach that boosts tumor-specific immune responses by inducing antigenic substances. However, the clinical application of oncolytic peptides has been hindered because of structural instability, proteolytic degradation, and undesired toxicity when administered systemically. <b>Methods:</b> Based on wasp venom peptide, an optimized stapled oncolytic peptide MP9 was developed with rigid α-helix, protease-resistance, and CRC cell cytotoxicity. By incorporating four functional motifs that include D-peptidomimetic inhibitor of PD-L1, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) cleavable spacer, and MP9 with 4-arm PEG, a novel peptide-polymer conjugate (PEG-MP9-aPDL1) was obtained and identified as the most promising systemic delivery vehicle with PD-L1 targeting specificity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. <b>Results:</b> We demonstrated that PEG-MP9-aPDL1-driven oncolysis induces a panel of immunogenic cell death (ICD)-relevant damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, which are key elements for immunotherapy with PD-L1 inhibitor. Further, PEG-MP9-aPDL1 exhibited prominent immunotherapeutic efficacy in a CRC mouse model characterized by tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells and induction of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) in the spleens. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that PEG-MP9-aPDL1 is an all-in-one platform for oncolytic immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).",2022-04-24
35525275,A novel small-molecule selective activator of homomeric GIRK4 channels.,"G protein-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are important pharmaceutical targets for neuronal, cardiac, and endocrine diseases. Although a number of GIRK channel modulators have been discovered in recent years, most lack selectivity. GIRK channels function as either homomeric (i.e., GIRK2 and GIRK4) or heteromeric (e.g., GIRK1/2, GIRK1/4, and GIRK2/3) tetramers. Activators, such as ML297, ivermectin, and GAT1508, have been shown to activate heteromeric GIRK1/2 channels better than GIRK1/4 channels with varying degrees of selectivity but not homomeric GIRK2 and GIRK4 channels. In addition, VU0529331 was discovered as the first homomeric GIRK channel activator, but it shows weak selectivity for GIRK2 over GIRK4 (or G4) homomeric channels. Here, we report the first highly selective small-molecule activator targeting GIRK4 homomeric channels, 3hi2one-G4 (3-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-3-hydroxy-1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one). We show that 3hi2one-G4 does not activate GIRK2, GIRK1/2, or GIRK1/4 channels. Using molecular modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology, we analyzed the binding site of 3hi2one-G4 formed by the transmembrane 1, transmembrane 2, and slide helix regions of the GIRK4 channel, near the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding site, and show that it causes channel activation by strengthening channel-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate interactions. We also identify slide helix residue L77 in GIRK4, corresponding to residue I82 in GIRK2, as a major determinant of isoform-specific selectivity. We propose that 3hi2one-G4 could serve as a useful pharmaceutical probe in studying GIRK4 channel function and may also be pursued in drug optimization studies to tackle GIRK4-related diseases such as primary aldosteronism and late-onset obesity.",2022-05-04
35508636,Discovery of first-in-class nanomolar inhibitors of heptosyltransferase I reveals a new aminoglycoside target and potential alternative mechanism of action.,"A clinically relevant inhibitor for Heptosyltransferase I (HepI) has been sought after for many years because of its critical role in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides on bacterial cell surfaces. While many labs have discovered or designed novel small molecule inhibitors, these compounds lacked the bioavailability and potency necessary for therapeutic use. Extensive characterization of the HepI protein has provided valuable insight into the dynamic motions necessary for catalysis that could be targeted for inhibition. Structural inspection of Kdo<sub>2</sub>-lipid A suggested aminoglycoside antibiotics as potential inhibitors for HepI. Multiple aminoglycosides have been experimentally validated to be first-in-class nanomolar inhibitors of HepI, with the best inhibitor demonstrating a K<sub>i</sub> of 600 ± 90 nM. Detailed kinetic analyses were performed to determine the mechanism of inhibition while circular dichroism spectroscopy, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were used to corroborate kinetic experimental findings. While aminoglycosides have long been described as potent antibiotics targeting bacterial ribosomes' protein synthesis leading to disruption of the stability of bacterial cell membranes, more recently researchers have shown that they only modestly impact protein production. Our research suggests an alternative and novel mechanism of action of aminoglycosides in the inhibition of HepI, which directly leads to modification of LPS production in vivo. This finding could change our understanding of how aminoglycoside antibiotics function, with interruption of LPS biosynthesis being an additional and important mechanism of aminoglycoside action. Further research to discern the microbiological impact of aminoglycosides on cells is warranted, as inhibition of the ribosome may not be the sole and primary mechanism of action. The inhibition of HepI by aminoglycosides may dramatically alter strategies to modify the structure of aminoglycosides to improve the efficacy in fighting bacterial infections.",2022-05-04
35505173,"Molecular dynamics, MMGBSA, and docking studies of natural products conjugated to tumor-targeted peptide for targeting BRAF V600E and MERTK receptors.","Recent studies have revealed that MERTK and BRAF V600E receptors have been found to be over-expressed in several types of cancers including melanoma, making these receptors targets for drug design. In this study, we have designed novel peptide conjugates with the natural products vanillic acid, thiazole-2-carboxylic acid, cinnamic acid, theanine, and protocatechuic acid. Each of these compounds was conjugated with the tumor targeting peptide sequence TAASGVRSMH, known to bind to NG2 and target tumor neovasculature. We examined their binding affinities and stability with MERTK and BRAF V600E receptors using molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies. Compared to the neat compounds, the peptide conjugates displayed higher binding affinity toward both receptors. In the case of MERTK, the most stable complexes were formed with di-theaninate-peptide, vanillate-peptide, and thiazole-2-amido peptide conjugates and binding occurred in the hinge region. Additionally, it was discovered that the peptide alone also had high binding ability and stability with the MERTK receptor. In the case of BRAF V600E, the peptide conjugates of protocatechuate, vanillate and thiazole-2-amido peptide conjugates showed the formation of the most stable complexes and binding occurred in the ATP binding cleft. Further analysis revealed that the number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions played a critical role in enhanced stability of the complexes. Docking studies also revealed that binding affinities for NG2 were similar to MERTK and higher for BRAF V600E. MMGBSA studies of the trajectories revealed that the protocatechuate-peptide conjugate showed the highest binding energy with BRAF V600E while the peptide-TAASGVRSMH showed the highest binding energy with MERTK. ADME studies revealed that each of the compounds showed medium to high permeability toward MDCK cells and were not hERG blockers. Furthermore, the conjugates were not CYP inhibitors or substrates, but they were found to be Pgp substrates. Our results indicated that the protocatechuate-TAASGVRSMH, thiazole-2-amido-TAASGVRSMH, and vanillate-TAASGVRSMH conjugates may be furthered developed for in vitro and in vivo studies as novel tumor targeting compounds for tumor cells over-expressing BRAF V600E, while di-theaninate-amido-TAASGVRSMH and thiazole-2-amido-TAASGVRSMH conjugates may be developed for targeting MERTK receptors. These studies provide insight into the molecular interactions of natural product-peptide conjugates and their potential for binding to and targeting MERTK and BRAF V600E receptors in developing new therapeutics for targeting cancer.",2022-05-03

Moreover, GLP-1 and cholecystokinin 2 (CCK<sub>2</sub> ) dual agonists have been shown to restore pancreas function and improve glycaemic control in preclinical studies. We describe, for the first time, the beneficial effects of GLP-1/glucagon receptor and GLP-1/CCK<sub>2</sub> dual agonists, which can be integrated into one peptide, resulting in significant anti-diabetes and anti-obesity effectiveness.",2022-05-20
35477128,FDFT1/FGFR2 rearrangement: A newly identified anlotinib-sensitive FGFR2 variant in cholangiocarcinoma.,"According to previous reports,10-16% of patients with clinically advanced cholangiocarcinoma develop FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements. Treatment with FGFR2-specific inhibitors (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs) has proven effective for patients with cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, we report a case of advanced cholangiocarcinoma, in which the patient was unable to tolerate the adverse effects of standard first-line chemotherapy. Genetic testing suggested the presence of a novel variant resulting from FDFT1/FGFR2 rearrangement. Owing to poor accessibility and high price, only a limited number of patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma have access to TKIs and precision targeted therapy in China. Anlotinib is a novel small-molecule multi-target TKI developed independently in China. It has a broad target spectrum, including FGFR, and can effectively inhibit tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation, thereby achieving an anti-tumor effect. Here, the patient was prescribed anlotinib. After treatment, the tumor size continued to shrink, and no significant adverse effects were reported. The finding suggested that anlotinib may be effective in patients with FDFT1/FGFR2 rearrangement and could serve as a novel treatment option for affected patients in future.",2022-04-20
35476173,A Novel Peptide Isolated from Microalgae Isochrysis zhanjiangensis Exhibits Anti-apoptosis and Anti-inflammation in Ox-LDL Induced HUVEC to Improve Atherosclerosis.,"In the early stage, oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) caused atherosclerosis, followed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) damage, leading to a variety of cardiovascular related diseases. This study investigated the mechanism of nonapeptide (EMFGTSSET, ETT) isolated from in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of Isochrysis zhanjiang on endothelial cell inflammation and apoptosis induced by ox-LDL in atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, the results shown that ETT inhibited the up-regulation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) induced by ox-LDL. Furthermore, ETT inhibited the fluorescence intensity of ROS, inflammatory factors (interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α) and the expression of cell adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion protein 1 and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1). In addition, it also upregulates nuclear red blood cell 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO -1), p-Akt, and bcl-2 levels. But down-regulated the expression of p-p65, p-IκB-α, p-p38, p-ERK, p-JNK, bax, and cleaved caspase-9/-3 (c-c-9/-3), thereby inhibited ox-LDL induction inflammation and apoptosis of atherosclerosis. Through molecular docking, it was judged that the stable interaction between ETT and LOX-1 and VCAM-1 was maintained through hydrogen bonding. These results can provide a theoretical basis for ETT as a potential substance for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, and further improve the value of Isochrysis zhanjiangensis.",2022-04-27
35460923,A high-throughput screening assay for mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 using acoustic droplet ejection mass spectrometry.,"Acoustic droplet ejection mass spectrometry (ADE-MS) has recently emerged as a promising label-free, MS-based readout method for high throughput screening (HTS) campaigns in early pharmaceutical drug discovery, since it enables high-speed analysis directly from 384- or 1536-well plates. In this manuscript we describe our characterization of an ADE-MS based high sample content enzymatic assay for mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) R132H with a strong focus on assay development. IDH1 R132H has become a very attractive therapeutic target in the field of antitumor drug discovery, and several pharmaceutical companies have attempted to develop novel small molecule inhibitors against mutant IDH1. With the development of an mIDH1 ADE-MS based HTS assay and a detailed comparison of this new readout technique to the commonly used fluorescence intensity mIDH1 assay, we demonstrated good correlation of both methods and were able to identify new potent inhibitors of mIDH1.",2022-04-20
35460166,Neuroprotective effects on microglia and insights into the structure-activity relationship of an antioxidant peptide isolated from Pelophylax perezi.,"Tryptophyllins constitute a heterogeneous group of peptides that are one of the first classes of peptides identified from amphibian's skin secretions. Here, we report the structural characterization and antioxidant properties of a novel tryptophyllin-like peptide, named PpT-2, isolated from the Iberian green frog Pelophylax perezi. The skin secretion of P. perezi was obtained by electrical stimulation and fractionated using RP-HPLC. De novo peptide sequencing was conducted using MALDI MS/MS. The primary structure of PpT-2 (FPWLLS-NH<sub>2</sub> ) was confirmed by Edman degradation and subsequently investigated using in silico tools. PpT-2 shared physicochemical properties with other well-known antioxidants. To test PpT-2 for antioxidant activity in vitro, the peptide was synthesized by solid phase and assessed in the chemical-based ABTS and DPPH scavenging assays. Then, a flow cytometry experiment was conducted to assess PpT-2 antioxidant activity in oxidatively challenged murine microglial cells. As predicted by the in silico analyses, PpT-2 scavenged free radicals in vitro and suppressed the generation of reactive species in PMA-stimulated BV-2 microglia cells. We further explored possible bioactivities of PpT-2 against prostate cancer cells and bacteria, against which the peptide exerted a moderate antiproliferative effect and negligible antimicrobial activity. The biocompatibility of PpT-2 was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays and in vivo toxicity with Galleria mellonella. No toxicity was detected in cells treated with up to 512 µg/ml and in G. mellonella treated with up to 40 mg/kg PpT-2. This novel peptide, PpT-2, stands as a promising peptide with potential therapeutic and biotechnological applications, mainly for the treatment/prevention of neurodegenerative disorders.",2022-04-23
35458672,"An Extensive Pharmacological Evaluation of New Anti-Cancer Triterpenoid (Nummularic Acid) from <i>Ipomoea batatas</i> through In Vitro, In Silico, and In Vivo Studies.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men, accounting for approximately 10% of all new cases in the United States. Plant-derived bioactive compounds, such as pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs), have the ability to inhibit PCa cell proliferation. We isolated and characterized nummularic acid (NA), a potent PT, as a major chemical constituent of Ipomoea batatas, a medicinal food plant used in ethnomedicine for centuries. In the current study, in vitro antiproliferative potential against PCa cells (DU145 and PC3) via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay; Western blot protein expression analysis; absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME); pharmacokinetic prediction studies; and bisphenol A (BPA)-induced prostate inhibition in Sprague Dawley rats were conducted to gauge the anti-cancer ability of NA. Significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) time- and dose-dependent reductions in proliferation of PCa cells, reduced migration, invasion, and increased apoptotic cell population were recorded after NA treatment (3−50 µM). After 72 h of treatment, NA displayed significant IC50 of 21.18 ± 3.43 µM against DU145 and 24.21 ± 3.38 µM against PC3 cells in comparison to the controls cabazitaxel (9.56 ± 1.45 µM and 12.78 ± 2.67 µM) and doxorubicin (10.98 ± 2.71 µM and 15.97 ± 2.77 µM). Further deep mechanistic studies reveal that NA treatment considerably increased the cleavage of caspases and downstream PARP, upregulated BAX and P53, and downregulated BCL-2 and NF-κB, inducing apoptosis in PCa cells. Pharmacokinetic and ADME characterization indicate that NA has a favorable physicochemical nature, with high gastrointestinal absorption, low blood−brain barrier permeability, no hepatotoxicity, and cytochrome inhibition. BPA-induced perturbations of prostate glands in Sprague Dawley rats show a potential increase (0.478 ± 0.28 g) in prostate weight compared to the control (0.385 ± 0.13 g). Multi-dose treatment with NA (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the prostate size (0.409 ± 0.21 g) in comparison to the control. NA-treated groups exhibited substantial restoration of hematological and histological parameters, reinstatement of serum hormones, and suppression of inflammatory markers. This multifaceted analysis suggests that NA, as a novel small molecule with a strong pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profile, has the potential to induce apoptosis and death in PCa cells.",2022-04-12
35448182,Developments in the Management of Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: A Review.,"Approximately 20% of breast cancers overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), providing an actionable target for many different therapies. In the metastatic setting, prognosis has improved greatly with the use of anti-HER2 drugs such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab-emtansine. In the third line setting and beyond, several emerging treatments have shown benefits, including novel small molecule targeted agents and antibody-drug conjugates. Systemic treatment of brain metastases in HER2-positive patients and the role of endocrine-based treatment for patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive disease remain areas of research interest. This article will review the current approach to systemic management of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in Canada, and present novel treatments that may be available in the near future.",2022-04-08
35419278,Targeting Epigenetic Regulatory Enzymes for Cancer Therapeutics: Novel Small-Molecule Epidrug Development.,"Dysregulation of the epigenetic enzyme-mediated transcription of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes is closely associated with the occurrence, progression, and prognosis of tumors. Based on the reversibility of epigenetic mechanisms, small-molecule compounds that target epigenetic regulation have become promising therapeutics. These compounds target epigenetic regulatory enzymes, including DNA methylases, histone modifiers (methylation and acetylation), enzymes that specifically recognize post-translational modifications, chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and post-transcriptional regulators. Few compounds have been used in clinical trials and exhibit certain therapeutic effects. Herein, we summarize the classification and therapeutic roles of compounds that target epigenetic regulatory enzymes in cancer treatment. Finally, we highlight how the natural compounds berberine and ginsenosides can target epigenetic regulatory enzymes to treat cancer.",2022-03-28
35417479,Aurintricarboxylic acid is a canonical disruptor of the TAZ-TEAD transcriptional complex.,"Disrupting the formation of the oncogenic YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional complex holds substantial therapeutic potential. However, the three protein interaction interfaces of this complex cannot be easily disrupted using small molecules. Here, we report that the pharmacologically active small molecule aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) acts as a disruptor of the TAZ-TEAD complex. ATA was identified in a high-throughput screen using a TAZ-TEAD AlphaLISA assay that was tailored to identify disruptors of this transcriptional complex. We further used fluorescence polarization assays both to confirm disruption of the TAZ-TEAD complex and to demonstrate that ATA binds to interface 3. We have previously shown that cell-based models that express the oncogenic TAZ-CAMTA1 (TC) fusion protein display enhanced TEAD transcriptional activity because TC functions as an activated form of TAZ. Utilizing cell-based studies and our TC model system, we performed TC/TEAD reporter, RNA-Seq, and qPCR assays and found that ATA inhibits TC/TEAD transcriptional activity. Further, disruption of TC/TEAD and TAZ/TEAD interaction by ATA abrogated anchorage-independent growth, the phenotype most closely linked to dysregulated TAZ/TEAD activity. Therefore, this study demonstrates that ATA is a novel small molecule that has the ability to disrupt the undruggable TAZ-TEAD interface.",2022-04-13
35405616,Discovery of oridonin as a novel agonist for BRS-3.,"Bombesin Receptor Subtype-3 (BRS-3, Bombesin-like receptor, BB<sub>3</sub>) is an orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Recent studies have shown that BRS-3 played a vital role in glucose regulation, insulin secretion, and energy homeostasis. Therefore, discovering more novel exogenous ligands with diverse structures for BRS-3 will be of great importance for target validation and drug development.",2022-04-03
35401832,Combating multidrug resistance and metastasis of breast cancer by endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell-nucleus penetration enhanced immunochemotherapy.,"<b>Rationale:</b> Multidrug resistance (MDR) and metastasis of breast cancer remain major hurdles in clinical anticancer therapy. The unsatisfactory outcome is largely due to insufficient cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents and limited immunogenic cell death (ICD). On the other hand, efflux proteins, especially P-glycoprotein (P-gp), can recognize and promote the efflux of drugs from tumor cells. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and peptide- functionalized doxorubicin (<sup>P</sup>DOX) were used to prepare a theranostic nanocomposite (Ag-TF@<sup>P</sup>DOX), which induced organelle-mediated immunochemotherapy and drug efflux protein inhibition in drug-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR) via a strategy based on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell-nucleus penetration. <b>Results:</b> The silver nanoparticle-triggered persistent activation of ER stress synergizes with chemotherapy to enhance cytotoxicity and stimulate the ICD effect. It has the potential to enhance chemosensitivity by downregulating of P-gp expression due to the increased production of ATP-consuming chaperones. In addition, the novel peptide (CB5005), which not only penetrates the cell membrane but also has a nuclear localization sequence, is conjugated to DOX to improve both cellular internalization and intranuclear accumulation. Moreover, surface TA-Fe<sup>3+</sup> engineering endows the nanocomposite with ATP-responsive disassembly and ATP depletion properties to improve biocompatibility and decrease ATP-dependent drug efflux. Ag-TF@<sup>P</sup>DOX has potential as a dual-mode (PAI/MRI) contrast-enhanced agent for realizing theranostic guidance. <b>Conclusion:</b> This theranostic nanocomposite greatly restricts the growth of drug-resistant breast tumors and activates a strong immune response as well, providing an opportunity for the development of therapeutics that reverse tumor MDR and metastasis at the subcellular level.",2022-03-21
35398031,"Pharmacological characterization of AS2690168, a novel small molecule RANKL signal transduction inhibitor.","Pathological osteolysis is associated with excessive bone resorption by activated osteoclasts. Given that receptor activator of NF-kB and its ligand (RANKL) are key players in the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts, the RANKL/RANK signaling pathway is considered a promising target for the development of effective osteoclastogenesis inhibitors. We previously found that the orally available compound, AS2690168, suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis of RAW264 cells. In this report, we further characterized the pharmacological profiles of AS2690168 in vitro and in vivo. AS2690168 suppressed soluble RANKL (sRANKL)-induced NFATc1 mRNA expression in RAW264 cells at 0.3 and 3.0 μM. It also suppressed calcium release from parathyroid hormone-stimulated mouse calvaria with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.46 μM. Oral administration of AS2690168 completely suppressed the decrease in femoral bone mineral content in an sRANKL-induced osteopenic mice model at 3.0 mg/kg. It also significantly suppressed the decrease in femoral bone mineral density and increase in serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b levels in ovariectomized rats at doses of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg. Finally, AS260168 suppressed the increase in urine deoxypyridinoline in a rat prednisolone-induced osteoporosis model at 10 mg/kg. These results suggest that AS2690168 is a promising treatment for bone disorders with excessive bone resorption.",2022-04-06
35369761,Small-molecule inhibitors of Slack potassium channels as potential therapeutics for childhood epilepsies.,"Slack channels are sodium-activated potassium channels that are encoded by the <i>KCNT1</i> gene. Several <i>KCNT1</i> gain of function mutations have been linked to malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy. Quinidine is an anti-arrhythmic drug that functions as a moderately potent inhibitor of Slack channels; however, quinidine use is limited by its poor selectivity, safety and pharmacokinetic profile. Slack channels represent an interesting target for developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy and other childhood epilepsies; thus, ongoing efforts are directed toward the discovery of small-molecules that inhibit Slack currents. This review summarizes patent applications published in 2020-2021 that describe the discovery of novel small-molecule Slack inhibitors.",2022-04-04
35366894,A novel peptide encoded by N6-methyladenosine modified circMAP3K4 prevents apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) regulate various biological activities and have been shown to play crucial roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. However, only a few coding circRNAs have been identified in cancers, and their roles in HCC remain elusive. This study aimed to identify coding circRNAs and explore their function in HCC.",2022-04-02
35359589,Mechanism of Peptide Agonist Binding in CXCR4 Chemokine Receptor.,"Chemokine receptors are key G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that control cell migration in immune system responses, development of cardiovascular and central nervous systems, and numerous diseases. In particular, the CXCR4 chemokine receptor promotes metastasis, tumor growth and angiogenesis in cancers. CXCR4 is also used as one of the two co-receptors for T-tropic HIV-1 entry into host cells. Therefore, CXCR4 serves as an important therapeutic target for treating cancers and HIV infection. Apart from the CXCL12 endogenous peptide agonist, previous studies suggested that the first 17 amino acids of CXCL12 are sufficient to activate CXCR4. Two 17-residue peptides with positions 1-4 mutated to RSVM and ASLW functioned as super and partial agonists of CXCR4, respectively. However, the mechanism of peptide agonist binding in CXCR4 remains unclear. Here, we have investigated this mechanism through all-atom simulations using a novel Peptide Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (Pep-GaMD) method. The Pep-GaMD simulations have allowed us to explore representative binding conformations of each peptide and identify critical low-energy states of CXCR4 activated by the super versus partial peptide agonists. Our simulations have provided important mechanistic insights into peptide agonist binding in CXCR4, which are expected to facilitate rational design of new peptide modulators of CXCR4 and other chemokine receptors.",2022-03-11
35357812,O-GlcNAcase Inhibitor ASN90 is a Multimodal Drug Candidate for Tau and α-Synuclein Proteinopathies.,"Neurodegenerative proteinopathies are characterized by the intracellular formation of insoluble and toxic protein aggregates in the brain that are closely linked to disease progression. In Alzheimer's disease and in rare tauopathies, aggregation of the microtubule-associated tau protein leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). In Parkinson's disease (PD) and other α-synucleinopathies, intracellular Lewy bodies containing aggregates of α-synuclein constitute the pathological hallmark. Inhibition of the glycoside hydrolase O-GlcNAcase (OGA) prevents the removal of O-linked <i>N</i>-acetyl-d-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) moieties from intracellular proteins and has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach to prevent the formation of tau pathology. Like tau, α-synuclein is known to be modified with O-GlcNAc moieties and <i>in vitro</i> these have been shown to prevent its aggregation and toxicity. Here, we report the preclinical discovery and development of a novel small molecule OGA inhibitor, ASN90. Consistent with the substantial exposure of the drug and demonstrating target engagement in the brain, the clinical OGA inhibitor ASN90 promoted the O-GlcNAcylation of tau and α-synuclein in brains of transgenic mice after daily oral dosing. Across human tauopathy mouse models, oral administration of ASN90 prevented the development of tau pathology (NFT formation), functional deficits in motor behavior and breathing, and increased survival. In addition, ASN90 slowed the progression of motor impairment and reduced astrogliosis in a frequently utilized α-synuclein-dependent preclinical rodent model of PD. These findings provide a strong rationale for the development of OGA inhibitors as disease-modifying agents in both tauopathies and α-synucleinopathies. Since tau and α-synuclein pathologies frequently co-exist in neurodegenerative diseases, OGA inhibitors represent unique, multimodal drug candidates for further clinical development.",2022-03-31
35339985,Novel Small Molecule Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 Inhibitors Increase Serum Phosphate and Improve Skeletal Abnormalities in <i>Hyp</i> Mice.,"Excess fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 causes hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, such as X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO). A small molecule that specifically binds to FGF23 to prevent activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor/<i>α</i>-Klotho complex has potential advantages over the currently approved systemically administered FGF23 blocking antibody. Using structure-based drug design, we previously identified ZINC13407541 (N-[[2-(2-phenylethenyl)cyclopenten-1-yl]methylidene]hydroxylamine) as a small molecule antagonist for FGF23. Additional structure-activity studies developed a series of ZINC13407541 analogs with enhanced drug-like properties. In this study, we tested in a preclinical <i>Hyp</i> mouse homolog of XLH a direct connect analog [(<i>E</i>)-2-(4-(<i>tert</i>-butyl)phenyl)cyclopent-1-ene-1-carbaldehyde oxime] (<b>8n</b>), which exhibited the greatest stability in microsomal assays, and [(<i>E</i>)-2-((<i>E</i>)-4-methylstyryl)benzaldehyde oxime] (<b>13a</b>), which exhibited increased in vitro potency. Using cryo-electron microscopy structure and computational docking, we identified a key binding residue (Q156) of the FGF23 antagonists, ZINC13407541, and its analogs (<b>8n</b> and <b>13a</b>) in the N-terminal domain of FGF23 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis and bimolecular fluorescence complementation-fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay confirmed the binding site of these three antagonists. We found that pharmacological inhibition of FGF23 with either of these compounds blocked FGF23 signaling and increased serum phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D] concentrations in <i>Hyp</i> mice. Long-term parenteral treatment with <b>8n</b> or <b>13a</b> also enhanced linear bone growth, increased mineralization of bone, and narrowed the growth plate in <i>Hyp</i> mice. The more potent <b>13a</b> compound had greater therapeutic effects in <i>Hyp</i> mice. Further optimization of these FGF23 inhibitors may lead to versatile drugs to treat excess FGF23-mediated disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study used structure-based drug design and medicinal chemistry approaches to identify and optimize small molecules with different stability and potency, which antagonize excessive actions of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) in hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets. The findings confirmed that these antagonists bind to the N-terminus of FGF23 to inhibit its binding to and activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptors/α-Klotho signaling complex. Administration of these lead compounds improved phosphate homeostasis and abnormal skeletal phenotypes in a preclinical <i>Hyp</i> mouse model.",2022-03-26

35321116,<i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> preclinical venom inhibition assays identify metalloproteinase inhibiting drugs as potential future treatments for snakebite envenoming by <i>Dispholidus typus</i>.,"Snakebite envenoming affects more than 250,000 people annually in sub-Saharan Africa. Envenoming by <i>Dispholidus typus</i> (boomslang) results in venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC), whereby highly abundant prothrombin-activating snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) consume clotting factors and deplete fibrinogen. The only available treatment for <i>D. typus</i> envenoming is the monovalent SAIMR Boomslang antivenom. Treatment options are urgently required because this antivenom is often difficult to source and, at US$6000/vial, typically unaffordable for most snakebite patients. We therefore investigated the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> preclinical efficacy of four SVMP inhibitors to neutralise the effects of <i>D. typus</i> venom; the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors marimastat and prinomastat, and the metal chelators dimercaprol and DMPS<i>.</i> The venom of <i>D. typus</i> exhibited an SVMP-driven procoagulant phenotype <i>in vitro</i>. Marimastat and prinomastat demonstrated equipotent inhibition of the SVMP-mediated procoagulant activity of the venom <i>in vitro</i>, whereas dimercaprol and DMPS showed considerably lower potency. However, when tested in preclinical murine models of envenoming using mixed sex CD1 mice, DMPS and marimastat demonstrated partial protection against venom lethality, demonstrated by prolonged survival times of experimental animals, whereas dimercaprol and prinomastat failed to confer any protection at the doses tested. The preclinical results presented here demonstrate that DMPS and marimastat show potential as novel small molecule-based therapeutics for <i>D. typus</i> snakebite envenoming. These two drugs have been previously shown to be effective against <i>Echis ocellatus</i> VICC in preclinical models, and thus we conclude that marimastat and DMPS should be further explored as potentially valuable early intervention therapeutics to broadly treat VICC following snakebite envenoming in sub-Saharan Africa.",2022-03-18
35316533,"Anticonvulsive properties of soticlestat, a novel cholesterol 24-hydroxylase inhibitor.","The formation of 24S-hydroxycholesterol is a brain-specific mechanism of cholesterol catabolism catalyzed by cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1, also known as CH24H). CH24H has been implicated in various biological mechanisms, whereas pharmacological lowering of 24S-hydroxycholesterol has not been fully studied. Soticlestat is a novel small-molecule inhibitor of CH24H. Its therapeutic potential was previously identified in a mouse model with an epileptic phenotype. In the present study, the anticonvulsive property of soticlestat was characterized in rodent models of epilepsy that have long been used to identify antiseizure medications.",2022-03-30
35298869,A novel AMPK activator shows therapeutic potential in hepatocellular carcinoma by suppressing HIF1α-mediated aerobic glycolysis.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by rapid growth, early vascular invasion, and high metastasis. Currently available US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs show low therapeutic efficacy, limiting HCC treatment to chemotherapy. We designed and synthesized a novel small molecule, SCT-1015, that allosterically activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to suppress the aerobic glycolysis in HCC. SCT-1015 was shown to bind the AMPK α and β-subunit interface, thereby exposing the kinase α domain to the upstream kinases, resulting in the increased AMPK activity. SCT-1015 dramatically reduced HCC cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. We further found that AMPK formed protein complexes with hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) and that SCT-1015-activated AMPK promoted hydroxylation of HIF1α (402P and 564P), resulting in HIF1α degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. With declined HIF1α abundance, many glycolysis-related enzymes were downregulated, suppressing aerobic glycolysis, and promoting oxidative phosphorylation. These results indicated that SCT-1015 channeled HCC cells into an unfavorable metabolic status. Overall, we reported SCT-1015 as a direct activator of AMPK signaling that held therapeutic potential in HCC.",2022-04-12
35292178,A novel eCIRP/TREM-1 pathway inhibitor attenuates acute kidney injury.,"Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein aggravates acute kidney injury after renal ischemia/reperfusion. Although extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein activates triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1, how this receptor and its antagonism with a novel peptide M3 affects acute kidney injury is poorly understood. We, therefore, hypothesize that inhibiting the extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein/triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 pathway with M3 attenuates acute kidney injury.",2022-03-12
35288363,CD11b agonists offer a novel approach for treating lupus nephritis.,"Lupus nephritis (LN) develops in more than a third of all systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and is the strongest predictor of morbidity and mortality. Increased circulating levels of type I interferon (IFN I) and anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-RNA binding protein (anti-RNP) antibodies lead to increased glomerular injury via leukocyte activation and glomerular infiltration. Uncontrolled Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in leukocytes results in increased production of IFN I and anti-dsDNA antibodies. ITGAM gene codes for integrin CD11b, the α-chain of integrin heterodimer CD11b/CD18, that is highly expressed in leukocytes and modulates TLR-dependent pro-inflammatory signaling. Three nonsynonymous SNPs in the ITGAM gene strongly correlate with increased risk for SLE and LN and with IFN I levels. Here we review the literature on the role of CD11b on leukocytes in LN. We also incorporate conclusions from several recent studies that show that these ITGAM SNPs result in a CD11b protein that is less able to suppress TLR-dependent pro-inflammatory pathways in leukocytes, that activation of CD11b via novel small molecule agonists suppresses TLR-dependent pathways, including reductions in circulating levels of IFN I and anti-dsDNA antibodies, and that CD11b activation reduces LN in model systems. Recent data strongly suggest that integrin CD11b is an exciting new therapeutic target in SLE and LN and that allosteric activation of CD11b is a novel therapeutic paradigm for effectively treating such autoimmune diseases.",2022-03-12
35281901,Mechanism of Action of Small-Molecule Agents in Ongoing Clinical Trials for SARS-CoV-2: A Review.,"Since the first reports from December 2019, COVID-19 caused an overwhelming global pandemic that has affected 223 countries, seriously endangering public health and creating an urgent need for effective drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, there is a lack of safe, effective, and specific therapeutic drugs for COVID-19, with mainly supportive and symptomatic treatments being administered to patients. The preferred option for responding to an outbreak of acute infectious disease is through drug repurposing, saving valuable time that would otherwise be lost in preclinical and clinical research, hastening clinical introduction, and lowering treatment costs. Alternatively, researchers seek to design and discover novel small-molecule candidate drugs targeting the key proteins in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 through an in-depth study of the infection mechanism, thus obtaining a number of candidate compounds with favorable antiviral effects in preclinical and clinical settings. There is an urgent need to further elucidate the efficacy and mechanism of action of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 small-molecule drugs. Herein, we review the candidate small-molecule anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in ongoing clinical trials, with a major focus on their mechanisms of action in an attempt to provide useful insight for further research and development of small-molecule compounds against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2022-02-25
35276386,Targeted inhibition of ZAK ameliorates renal interstitial fibrosis.,"ZAK (sterile alpha motif and leucine zipper-containing kinase) is a newly discovered member of the subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks). The role of ZAK in kidney disease remains largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the expression and function of ZAK in the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). ZAK was induced, predominantly in tubular epithelium, in both fibrotic kidneys of human and mouse models with TIF. ZAK expression level was correlated with the extent of renal fibrosis and the decline of eGFR of CKD patients. Depleting ZAK attenuated TIF and inflammation induced by unilateral ureteral occlusion (UUO) together with decreased activation of p38 MAPK and Smads signaling. Moreover, we demonstrated that overexpressed ZAK was in complex with Smad2/3 and TGF-β receptor Ⅰ (TβRI). Whereas, silencing endogenous ZAK ameliorated the amount of Smad2/3 recruited to TβRI. Moreover, we discovered a novel small molecule inhibitor of ZAK, named 6p. In vitro, incubation with 6p inhibited TGF-β1-induced fibrogenic response in NRK52E cells. In vivo, intragastric administration of 6p ameliorated TIF and inflammation in UUO and unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury model. Delayed administration of 6p was also effective in retarding the progression of the established TIF. In conclusion, ZAK is a novel therapeutic target for TIF, and 6p might be a potential therapeutic agent for TIF.",2022-03-08
35272134,A novel peptide vaccination augments cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis HspX antigen.,"Cellular immunity is a critical factor determining the safety and efficacy of newly developed vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Crosstalk between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes plays central roles in perpetuating the cytotoxic killing to the infected cells for host clearance. Our study proposed a novel alternating MHC-class II restricted peptide vaccination strategy to enhance the antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activity against alpha-crystalline heat-shock protein (HspX) in C57BL/6 mice. Alternating peptide vaccination significantly stimulated a prominent HspX-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response with elevated Th1 and Th17 responses, without interference from Tregs suppression. Heightened central and effector CD8 memory were apparent in mice receiving alternating peptide vaccine, indicating a persisting recall immunity against HspX antigen. It was unlikely for alternating peptide vaccine to cause dysregulation in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells as shown by minimal expression of KLRG1, PD1, LAG3, and CTLA-4 markers. Strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were demonstrated in mice administrated with alternating peptide vaccines, suggesting its capacity in executing killing effector function against targeted cells. In conclusion, our novel vaccination strategy delineated potential benefits of alternating MHC-II peptides to invigorate efficient cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses against HspX antigen. Such approach might be applicable to serve as alternative immunotherapy for latent tuberculosis infection in future.",2022-03-05
35260876,"Screening and identification of a novel antidiabetic peptide from collagen hydrolysates of Chinese giant salamander skin: network pharmacology, inhibition kinetics and protection of IR-HepG2 cells.","In this study, a novel peptide GPPGPA was screened from the collagen hydrolysates of Chinese giant salamander (<i>Andrias davidianus</i>) skin, and its anti-diabetes mechanism was predicted by network pharmacology, and an inhibitory effect on α-glycosidase and protective effect on IR (insulin resistance) and oxidative stress of IR-HepG2 cells were detected. Through network pharmacology screening, GPPGPA was found to have good drug-like properties, and 103 targets of GPPGPA overlap with T2DM targets. These targets were mainly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway associated with T2DM, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, the TNF signaling pathway, insulin resistance and so on. The core targets were identified as AKT1, MAPK8, MAPK10 and JUN by constructing a ""peptide-target-pathway"" network. The molecular docking results showed that GPPGPA was well bound to the core targets. These results suggested that GPPGPA had the potential to reduce T2DM. Further <i>in vitro</i> experiments showed that GPPGPA as a competitive inhibitor could effectively inhibit the activity of α-glucosidase. The results of the IR-HepG2 cell model experiments showed that GPPGPA was not toxic to HepG2 cells, and could reduce IR of HepG2 cells induced by high-glucose and high-insulin, improve glucose consumption, increase the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduce the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). The above results suggested that GPPGPA could improve T2DM by reducing insulin resistance through a multi-target and multi-pathway mechanism. GPPGPA could be developed and utilized as a novel hyperglycemic inhibitor in functional food.",2022-03-21
35252541,Optimizing peptide inhibitors of SARS-Cov-2 nsp10/nsp16 methyltransferase predicted through molecular simulation and machine learning.,"Coronaviruses, including the recent pandemic strain SARS-Cov-2, use a multifunctional 2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) to restrict the host defense mechanism and to methylate RNA. The nonstructural protein 16 2'-O-MTase (nsp16) becomes active when nonstructural protein 10 (nsp10) and nsp16 interact. Novel peptide drugs have shown promise in the treatment of numerous diseases and new research has established that nsp10 derived peptides can disrupt viral methyltransferase activity via interaction of nsp16. This study had the goal of optimizing new analogous nsp10 peptides that have the ability to bind nsp16 with equal to or higher affinity than those naturally occurring. The following research demonstrates that in silico molecular simulations can shed light on peptide structures and predict the potential of new peptides to interrupt methyltransferase activity via the nsp10/nsp16 interface. The simulations suggest that misalignments at residues F68, H80, I81, D94, and Y96 or rotation at H80 abrogate MTase function. We develop a new set of peptides based on conserved regions of the nsp10 protein in the <i>Coronaviridae</i> species and test these to known MTase variant values. This results in the prediction that the H80R variant is a solid new candidate for potential new testing. We envision that this new lead is the beginning of a reputable foundation of a new computational method that combats coronaviruses and that is beneficial for new peptide drug development.",2022-02-28
35251350,Inhibiting mutant KRAS G12D gene expression using novel peptide nucleic acid-based antisense: A potential new drug candidate for pancreatic cancer.,"KRAS mutations, which are the main cause of the pathogenesis of lethal pancreatic adenocarcinomas, impair the functioning of the GTPase subunit, thus rendering it constitutively active and signaling intracellular pathways that end with cell transformation. In the present study, the AsPC-1 cell line, which has a G12D-mutated KRAS gene sequence, was utilized as a cellular model to test peptide nucleic acid-based antisense technology. The use of peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) that are built to exhibit improved hybridization specificity and have an affinity for complementary RNA and DNA sequences, as well as a simple chemical structure and high biological stability that affords resistance to nucleases and proteases, enabled targeting of the KRAS-mutated gene to inhibit its expression at the translation level. Because PNA-based antisense molecules should be capable of binding to KRAS mRNA sequences, PNAs were utilized to target the mRNA of the mutated KRAS gene, a strategy that could lead to the development of a novel drug for pancreatic cancer. Moreover, it was demonstrated that introducing new PNA to cells inhibited the growth of cancer cells and induced apoptotic death and, notably, that it can inhibit G12D-mutated KRAS gene expression, as demonstrated by RT-PCR and western blotting. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the use of PNA-based antisense agents is an attractive therapeutic approach to treating KRAS-driven cancers and may lead to the development of novel drugs that target the expression of other mutated genes.",2022-02-21
35245627,SS-4 is a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation that potently inhibits GBM tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive cancer with a dismal prognosis. Constitutively active STAT3 has a causal role in GBM progression and is associated with poor patient survival. We rationally designed a novel small molecule, SS-4, by computational modeling to specifically interact with STAT3. SS-4 strongly and selectively inhibited STAT3 tyrosine (Y)-705 phosphorylation in MT330 and LN229 GBM cells and inhibited their proliferation and induced apoptosis with an IC<sub>50</sub> of ∼100 nM. The antiproliferative and apoptotic actions of SS-4 were Y-705 phosphorylation dependent, as evidenced by its lack of effects on STAT3 knockout (STAT3<sup>KO</sup>) cells or STAT3<sup>KO</sup> cells that overexpressed a phospho-Y705 deficient (STAT3Y705F) mutant, and the recovery of effects when wild-type STAT3 or a phospho-serine (S)727 deficient mutant was expressed in STAT3<sup>KO</sup> cells. SS-4 increased the expression of STAT3 repressed genes, while decreasing the expression of STAT3 promoted genes. Importantly, SS-4 markedly reduced the growth of GBM intracranial tumor xenografts. These data together identify SS-4 as a potent STAT3 inhibitor that selectively blocks Y705-phosphorylation, induces apoptosis, and inhibits growth of human GBM models in vitro and in vivo.",2022-03-01

Once activated, they contribute to an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) leading to cardiac fibrosis and subsequently organ dysfunction. With the exception of the pulmonary drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, drugs specifically targeting anti-fibrotic pathways are scarce. We recently performed large library screenings of natural occurring compounds and identified first lead structures with anti-fibrotic properties in vitro and in vivo. In line, we now aimed to improve efficacy of these anti-fibrotic lead structures by combining in vitro validation studies and in silico prediction. Next to this combined approach, we performed large OMICs-multi-panel-based mechanistic studies. Applying human cardiac fibroblasts (HCF), we analysed 26 similars of the initially identified anti-fibrotic lead molecules bufalin and lycorine and determined anti-proliferative activity and potential toxicity in an array of in vitro and ex vivo studies. Of note, even at lower concentrations, certain similars were more effective at inhibiting HCF proliferation than nintedanib and pirfenidone. Additionally, selected similars showed low cytotoxicity on human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes and anti-fibrotic gene regulation in human ex vivo living myocardial slices. Further, array and RNA sequencing studies of coding and non-coding RNAs in treated HCFs revealed strong anti-fibrotic properties, especially with the lycorine similar lyco-s (also known as homoharringtonine), that led to a nearly complete shutdown of ECM production at concentrations 100-fold lower than the previously identified anti-fibrotic compound lycorine without inducing cellular toxicity. We thus identified a new natural compound similar with strong anti-fibrotic properties in human cardiac fibroblasts and human living heart tissue potentially opening new anti-fibrotic treatment strategies.",2022-03-02
35222065,"Natriuretic Peptides and Blood Pressure Homeostasis: Implications for MANP, a Novel Guanylyl Cyclase a Receptor Activator for Hypertension.",The heart serves as an endocrine organ producing the hormones atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) which <i>via</i> the guanylyl cyclase A (GC-A) receptor and the second messenger cGMP participate in blood pressure homeostasis under physiologic conditions. Genetic models of the ANP gene or the GCA receptor together with genomic medicine have solidified the concept that both cardiac hormones are fundamental for blood pressure homeostasis and when deficient or disrupted they may contribute to human hypertension. Advances in peptide engineering have led to novel peptide therapeutics including the ANP-analog MANP for human hypertension. Most importantly a first in human study of MANP in essential hypertension has demonstrated its unique properties of aldosterone suppression and blood pressure reduction. Physiology and pharmacology ultimately lead us to innovative peptide-based therapeutics to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease.,2022-02-11
35214622,Active Humoral Response Reverts Tumorigenicity through Disruption of Key Signaling Pathway.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are amongst the most important breakthroughs in cancer therapeutics. However, high cost and short acting time limits its affordability and clinical application. Therefore, an economical and durable alternative is urgently needed. Previously, we identified an IL-17RB targeting mAb which intercepts IL-17B/IL-17RB signal transduction and suppresses tumorigenesis in many types of cancer. We reason that active immunity against the antigenic epitope of IL-17RB can reproduce the anti-cancer effect of mAbs with better sustainability. Here, we present a cancer vaccine composed of multiple synthesized epitope peptides chemically conjugated onto CRM197, a highly immunogenic carrier protein. Combining mass spectrometry with immunoassay, we standardized hapten density determination and optimized vaccine design. Furthermore, orthotopically transplanted syngeneic mouse tumor 4T1 showed that administration of this vaccine therapeutically mitigates primary cancer growth as well as distance metastasis. In conclusion, we demonstrate preparation, characterization and pre-clinical application of a novel peptide cancer vaccine.",2022-01-21
35202743,Albumin metabolism targeted peptide-drug conjugate strategy for targeting pan-KRAS mutant cancer.,"Despite recent breakthroughs in the development of direct KRAS inhibitors and modulators, no drugs targeting pan-KRAS mutant cancers are clinically available. Here, we report a novel strategy to treat pan-KRAS cancers using a caspase-3 cleavable peptide-drug conjugate that exploits enhanced albumin metabolism in KRAS altered cancers to deliver a cytotoxic agent that can induce a widespread bystander killing effect in tumor cells. Increased albumin metabolism in KRAS mutant cancer cells induced apoptosis via the intracellular uptake of albumin-bound MPD1. This allowed caspase-3 upregulation activated MPD1 to release the payload and exert the non-selective killing of neighboring cancer cells. MPD1 exhibited potent and durable antitumor efficacy in mouse xenograft models with different KRAS genotypes. An augmentation of anti-cancer efficacy was achieved by the bystander killing effect derived from the caspase-3 mediated activation of MPD1. In summary, albumin metabolism-induced apoptosis, together with the bystander killing effect of MPD1 boosted by caspase-3 mediated activation, intensified the efficacy of MPD1 in KRAS mutant cancers. These findings suggest that this novel peptide-drug conjugate could be a promising breakthrough for the treatment in the targeting of pan-KRAS mutant cancers.",2022-02-22
35200639,A Novel Peptide Derived from <i>Arca inflata</i> Induces Apoptosis in Colorectal Cancer Cells through Mitochondria and the p38 MAPK Pathway.,"Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related incidence and deaths. Here, we identified a novel antitumor peptide, P6, with a molecular weight of 2794.8 Da from a marine Chinese medicine, <i>Arca inflata</i> Reeve. The full amino acid sequence and secondary structure of P6 were determined by tandem mass de novo sequencing and circular dichroism spectroscopy, respectively. P6 markedly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced apoptosis in CRC cells. Mechanistically, transcriptomics analysis and a serial functional evaluation showed that P6 induced colon cancer cell apoptosis through the activation of the p38-MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, it was demonstrated that P6 exhibited antitumor effects in a tumor xenograft model, and induced cell cycle arrest in CRC cells in a concentration-dependent mode. These findings provide the first line of indication that P6 could be a potential therapeutic agent for CRC treatment.",2022-01-29
35196855,Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor of NLRP3 Inflammasome Reverses Cognitive Impairment in an Alzheimer's Disease Model.,"Aberrant activation of the Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays an essential role in multiple diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and psoriasis. We report a novel small-molecule inhibitor, NLRP3-inhibitory compound 7 (NIC7), and its derivative, which inhibit NLRP3-mediated activation of caspase 1 along with the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, and lactate dehydrogenase. We examined the therapeutic potential of NIC7 in a disease model of AD by analyzing its effect on cognitive impairment as well as the expression of dopamine receptors and neuronal markers. NIC7 significantly reversed the associated disease symptoms in the mice model. On the other hand, NIC7 did not reverse the disease symptoms in the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced disease model of psoriasis. This indicates that IMQ-based psoriasis is independent of NLRP3. Overall, NIC7 and its derivative have therapeutic prospects to treat AD or NLRP3-mediated diseases.",2022-02-23

35168793,Molecular networking-based strategies in mass spectrometry coupled with in silico dereplication of peptidic natural products and gene cluster analysis.,"Peptidic natural products (PNPs) are valuable sources for drug development as they are often associated with desirable bioactivities. Chemoenzymatic approaches coupled with description of structure-activity relationships have enabled the production of analogs to PNPs such as daptomycin and vancomycin which exhibit optimized bioactivities. The natural promiscuity of biosynthetic enzymes allows the producer organism to generate various analogs potentially serving as multiple hits for one target or to diversify the bioactivity of a given natural product. Thus, approaches that allow rapid discovery of novel peptide natural products by mining their presence in crude extracts while providing insights into promiscuity of biosynthetic enzymes are sought out by natural product biochemists and chemists. In this chapter, we describe how two different molecular networking-based approaches combined with in silico tools can be used to dereplicate PNPs from untargeted mass spectrometry data acquired on crude extracts and how to propagate annotations to structurally related molecules. We further describe steps to gain knowledge of enzyme promiscuity by combining molecular networking analysis with gene cluster analysis.",2021-10-16
35167006,The Use of Targeted Agents in the Treatment of Gynecologic Cancers.,"Patients with advanced and recurrent ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancers have limited efficacious treatment options and poor outcomes. The development of agents that target DNA repair mechanisms, angiogenesis, immune checkpoints, and hormone receptor expression provides additional options for these patients. Many available targeted therapies have limited efficacy as single agents, so clinical trials investigating combination therapies as well as continued identification and validation of predictive biomarkers are critical. Many novel small molecule therapies, antibody drug conjugates, and therapeutic vaccines are also in development. This review will focus on recent evidence supporting the use of clinically available targeted therapies for gynecologic cancer.",2022-02-15
35158211,Peptide OM-LV20 promotes structural and functional recovery of spinal cord injury in rats.,"At present, there are no satisfactory therapeutic drugs for the functional recovery of spinal cord injury (SCI). We previously identified a novel peptide (OM-LV20) that accelerated the regeneration of injured skin tissues of mice and exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. Here, the intraperitoneal injection of OM-LV20 (1 μg/kg) markedly improved motor function recovery in the hind limbs of rats with traumatic SCI, and further enhanced spinal cord repair. Administration of OM-LV20 increased the number of surviving neuron bodies, as well as the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB). In the acute stage of SCI, OM-LV20 treatment also increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione content but decreased the levels of malonaldehyde and nitric oxide. Thus, OM-LV20 significantly promoted structural and functional recovery of SCI in adult rats by increasing neuronal survival and BDNF and TrkB expression, and thereby regulating the balance of oxidative stress. Based on our knowledge, this research is the first report on the effects of amphibian-derived peptide on the recovery of SCI and our results highlight the potential of peptide OM-LV20 administration in the acceleration of the recovery of SCI.",2022-02-07
35154362,Theta-Defensins to Counter COVID-19 as Furin Inhibitors: <i>In Silico</i> Efficiency Prediction and Novel Compound Design.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Dec. 2019. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the cell membrane through spike proteins on its surface and infects the cell. Furin, a host-cell enzyme, possesses a binding site for the spike protein. Thus, molecules that block furin could potentially be a therapeutic solution. Defensins are antimicrobial peptides that can hypothetically inhibit furin because of their arginine-rich structure. Theta-defensins, a subclass of defensins, have attracted attention as drug candidates due to their small size, unique structure, and involvement in several defense mechanisms. Theta-defensins could be a potential treatment for COVID-19 through furin inhibition and an anti-inflammatory mechanism. Note that inflammatory events are a significant and deadly condition that could happen at the later stages of COVID-19 infection. Here, the potential of theta-defensins against SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated through <i>in silico</i> approaches. Based on docking analysis results, theta-defensins can function as furin inhibitors. Additionally, a novel candidate peptide against COVID-19 with optimal properties regarding antigenicity, stability, electrostatic potential, and binding strength was proposed. Further <i>in vitro</i>/<i>in vivo</i> investigations could verify the efficiency of the designed novel peptide.",2022-02-09
35149434,"A novel peptide identified from visceral ganglia induces oocyte maturation, spermatozoa active motility, and spawning in the pen shell Atrinapectinata.","The identification of novel peptides that regulate reproduction is essential for studying reproductive physiology in bivalves. Therefore, we aimed to identify peptides that affect the reproductive physiology of bivalves. We identified an oocyte maturation-, sperm motility-, and spawning-inducing peptide from the visceral ganglia of the pen shell, Atrina pectinata. The peptide consisted of 26 amino acid residues (GFDSINFPGTIDGFKDYSSNKKERLL). This peptide induced oocyte maturation and sperm motility activation at less than 1 nM upon the treatment of gonad fragments and induced spawning at 1 nmol when injected into mature individuals. Mature eggs and sperms artificially spawned by peptide administration were fertilized, and we confirmed that the development proceeded normally to veliger (D-shape) larvae. These results indicated that GFDSINFPGTIDGFKDYSSNKKERLL stimulated the gonads of pen shells and induced oocyte maturation, sperm motility activation, and spawning.",2022-02-03
35142491,Identification and Optimization of Novel Small-Molecule Cas9 Inhibitors by Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening.,"CRISPR/Cas9 has revolutionized several areas of life science; however, methods to control the Cas9 activity are needed for both scientific and therapeutic applications. Anti-CRISPR proteins are known to inhibit the CRISPR/Cas adaptive immunity; however, <i>in vivo</i> delivery of such proteins is problematic. Instead, small-molecule Cas9 inhibitors could serve as useful tools due to their permeable, proteolytically stable, and non-immunogenic nature. Here, we identified a small-molecule ligand with anti-CRISPR/Cas9 activity through a high-throughput screening utilizing an <i>Escherichia coli</i> selection system. Extensive structure-activity relationship studies, which involved a deconstruction-reconstruction strategy, resulted in a range of analogues with significant improvements in the inhibitory activity. Based on NMR and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we propose that the inhibitory action of these compounds likely results from direct binding to apo-Cas9, preventing Cas9:gRNA complex formation. These molecules may find use as Cas9 modulators in various applications.",2022-02-10
35133171,"Development of a Novel, Small-Molecule Brain-Penetrant Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor That Enhances Spatial Memory Formation in Mice.","Histone acetylation is a prominent epigenetic modification linked to the memory loss symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disease. The use of existing histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) drugs for treatment is precluded by their weak blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and undesirable toxicity. Here, we address these shortcomings by developing a new class of disulfide-based compounds, inspired by the scaffold of the FDA-approved HDACi romidepsin (FK288). Our findings indicate that our novel compound MJM-1 increases the overall level of histone 3 (H3) acetylation in a prostate cancer cell line. In mice, MJM-1 injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) crossed the BBB and could be detected in the hippocampus, a brain region that mediates memory. Consistent with this finding, we found that the post-training i.p. administration of MJM-1 enhanced hippocampus-dependent spatial memory consolidation in male mice. Therefore, MJM-1 represents a potential lead for further optimization as a therapeutic strategy for ameliorating cognitive deficits in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",2022-02-08
35132224,Mechanisms regulating PD-L1 expression in cancers and associated opportunities for novel small-molecule therapeutics.,"Antagonistic antibodies targeting the inhibitory immune-checkpoint receptor PD-1 or its ligand PD-L1 are used to treat a wide range of cancer types and can substantially improve patient survival. Nevertheless, strategies to overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance are required to respectively increase response rates and durations. PD-L1 is often upregulated in various malignancies, and emerging evidence suggests numerous underlying mechanisms involving distinct oncogenic signalling pathways. Thus, specific small-molecule inhibitors have the potential to simultaneously suppress not only a key oncogenic signalling pathway but also PD-L1 expression and/or activity in particular cancers, thereby presenting attractive candidate drugs for combination with existing immune-checkpoint inhibitors and/or other targeted agents. Herein, we summarize advances in understanding the mechanisms regulating PD-L1 expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels in cancers. We describe the roles of the diverse post-translational modifications of PD-L1, including phosphorylation, palmitoylation, glycosylation, acetylation and ubiquitination. Moreover, we discuss the potential use of small-molecule agents to modulate these mechanisms as well as of predictive biomarkers to stratify patients for optimal treatment, and provide our perspective on potential therapeutic strategies to circumvent resistance to conventional anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies.",2022-02-07
35128404,Macrocyclic DNA-encoded chemical libraries: a historical perspective.,"While macrocyclic peptides are extensively researched for therapeutically relevant protein targets, DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DELs) are developed at a quick pace to discover novel small molecule binders. The combination of both fields has been explored since 2004 and the number of macrocyclic peptide DELs is steadily increasing. Macrocycles with high affinity and potency were identified for diverse classes of proteins, revealing DEL's huge potential. By giving a historical perspective, we would like to review the methods which permitted the rise of macrocyclic peptide DELs, describe the different DELs which were created and discuss the achievements and challenges of this emerging field.",2021-10-29
35124531,"Design and synthesis of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives for a novel PAC1 receptor antagonist.","Since PA-8 (5-(4-(Allyloxy)-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-amino-5,8-dihydro-3H,6H-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,7-dione) was recently identified as a novel small-molecule antagonist of the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) type I (PAC1) receptor, a series of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives have been designed, synthesized and subsequently evaluated for antagonistic activity on the PAC1 receptor. In this study, we synthesized 21 derivatives based on the PA-8 structure. Among them, the compound 2o (2-Amino-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-5,8-dihydro-3H,6H-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,7-dione) showed more potent antagonistic activities than PA-8. Intrathecal (i.t.) injection of 2o blocked the induction of PACAP-induced aversive behaviors and mechanical allodynia in mice, and the effects were more potent than those of PA-8. A single i.t. injection of 2o also inhibited spinal nerve ligation (SNL)-induced mechanical allodynia. Repeated intraperitoneal administration of 2o gradually reduced the SNL-induced mechanical allodynia, and this effect appeared earlier than for PA-8. In addition, 2o exhibited a favorable ADME and pharmacokinetics profiles. These results suggest that 2o may become an analgesic for the treatment of neuropathic pain.",2022-01-29
35121048,A novel small-molecule activator of unfolded protein response suppresses castration-resistant prostate cancer growth.,"Androgen receptor-targeted therapy improves survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, almost all patients with CRPC eventually develop secondary resistance to these drugs. Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches for incurable metastatic CRPC are urgently needed. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is regarded as a cytoprotective mechanism that removes misfolded proteins in rapidly proliferating tumor cells. However, acute activation of the UPR directly leads to tumor cell death. This study has shown that WJ-644A, a novel small molecule activator of UPR, potently inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and caused tumor regression with a good safety profile in multiple animal models. Mechanistically, we have identified that WJ-644A induced cell methuosis and autophagy upon UPR activation. Our study not only identifies the UPR as an actionable target for CRPC treatment, but also establishes WJ-644A as a novel UPR activator that has potential therapeutic value for CRPC.",2022-02-02
35120937,Structural and molecular dynamics of ammonia transport in Staphylococcus aureus NH<sub>3</sub>-dependent NAD synthetase.,"Ammonia dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> synthetase from multi drug resistance Staphylococcus aureus catalyzes ATP dependent formation of NAD<sup>+</sup> from deamido-NAD<sup>+</sup> and ammonia at the synthetase active site. Binding of ATP accompanies a large movement of flexible loop region (205-225) acting as a lid to the catalytic core. A 17 Å long ammonia tunnel with an entry and exit radius of 3.5 Å and 3.2 Å respectively allows transfer of ammonia from surface to the active site of the enzyme in each monomer to attack the C7N=O7N linkage of transient intermediate NAD-adenylate thus releasing NAD<sup>+</sup>. In this study, we report structural details of ammonia transport tunnel in Staphylococcus aureus NH<sub>3</sub>-dependent NAD synthetase and compared their architecture and dynamics with other bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes. Tunnel shows conformational variations in apo and substrate complexes and is less intricate compared to glutamine dependent counterparts. We have also performed steered molecular dynamic simulations of ammonia transport across the tunnel in enzyme-intermediate complex which reveals critical bottleneck residues and structural determinants during ammonium migration. Ordered water molecules and conserved charged residues form a network of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interaction which facilitate the ammonium movement towards the active center. Analysis of the sMD simulated structural snapshots delineates the conformational reshaping of ammonia tunnel at the different step of the enzymatic reaction. Tunnel architecture and environment could offer the new target site to design novel small molecule inhibitors for the development of more efficient therapeutics against multi drug resistant S. aureus strains.",2022-02-02

The available anti-<i>Leishmania</i> drugs for treatment have limitations such as high toxicity and variable efficacy. To improve the therapeutic index of anti-<i>Leishmania</i> drugs, the search for a new drug or a new natural compound in combination therapy instead of using monotherapy to reduce drug side effect and have high efficacy is required. In this study, anti-<i>Leishmania</i> activity of 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQN) and its synergistic effect with amphotericin B (AmB) against <i>L. martiniquensis</i> were evaluated <i>in vitro</i> for the first time. These results showed that 8HQN presented anti-<i>Leishmania</i> activity against <i>L. martiniquensis</i> with IC<sub>50</sub> 1.60 ± 0.28 and 1.56 ± 0.02 µg/mL for promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes, respectively. The selectivity index (SI) value of 8HQN was 79.84 for promastigotes and 82.40 for intracellular amastigotes, which highlight promising results for the use of 8HQN in the treatment of <i>L. martiniquensis</i>-infected host cells. Interestingly, four combinations of 8HQN and AmB provided synergistic effects for intracellular amastigotes and showed no toxic effects to host cells. These results provided information of using a combination therapy in treating this <i>Leishmania</i> species leads to further development of therapy and can be considered as an alternative treatment for leishmaniasis.",2022-01-18
35110393,"A Phase I, First-in-Human, Healthy Volunteer Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of CVN424, a Novel G Protein-Coupled Receptor 6 Inverse Agonist for Parkinson's Disease.","CVN424 is a novel small molecule and first-in-class candidate therapeutic to selectively modulate GPR6, an orphan G-protein coupled receptor. Expression of GPR6 is largely confined to the subset of striatal projection neurons that give rise to the indirect (striatopallidal) pathway, important in the control of movement. CVN424 improves motor function in preclinical animal models of Parkinson's disease. Here, we report results of a phase 1, first-in-human study investigating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CVN424 in healthy volunteers. The study (NCT03657030) was randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled. CVN424 was orally administered in ascending doses to successive cohorts as inpatients in a clinical research unit. Single doses ranged from 1 mg to 225 mg, and repeated (7 day) daily doses were 25, 75, or 150 mg. CVN424 peak plasma concentrations were reached within 2 h post-dose in the fasted state and increased with increasing dose. Dosing after a standardized high-fat meal reduced and delayed the peak plasma concentration, but total plasma exposure was similar. Mean terminal half-life ranged from 30 to 41 h. CVN424 was generally well tolerated: no serious or severe adverse effects were observed, and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters. We conclude that CVN424, a nondopaminergic compound that modulates a novel therapeutic target, was safe and well tolerated. A phase 2 study in patients with Parkinson's disease is underway. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This is the first-in-human clinical study of a first-in-class candidate therapeutic. CVN424 modulates a novel drug target, GPR6, which is selectively expressed in a pathway in the brain that has been implicated in the motor dysfunction of patients with Parkinson's disease.

35099767,Inducible Prostaglandin E Synthase as a Pharmacological Target for Ischemic Stroke.,"As the inducible terminal enzyme for prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) synthesis, microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) contributes to neuroinflammation and secondary brain injury after cerebral ischemia via producing excessive PGE<sub>2</sub>. However, a proof of concept that mPGES-1 is a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke has not been established by a pharmacological strategy mainly due to the lack of drug-like mPGES-1 inhibitors that can be used in relevant rodent models. To this end, we recently developed a series of novel small-molecule compounds that can inhibit both human and rodent mPGES-1. In this study, blockade of mPGES-1 by our several novel compounds abolished the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PGE<sub>2</sub> and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in mouse primary brain microglia. Inhibition of mPGES-1 also decreased PGE<sub>2</sub> produced by neuronal cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stress. Among the five enzymes for PGE<sub>2</sub> biosynthesis, mPGES-1 was the most induced one in cerebral ischemic lesions. Systemic treatment with our lead compound MPO-0063 (5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) improved post-stroke well-being, decreased infarction and edema, suppressed induction of brain cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), alleviated locomotor dysfunction and anxiety-like behavior, and reduced the long-term cognitive impairments. The therapeutic effects of MPO-0063 in this proof-of-concept study provide the first pharmacological evidence that mPGES-1 represents a feasible target for delayed, adjunct treatment - along with reperfusion therapies - for acute brain ischemia.",2022-01-31

The present study describes the in vitro pharmacological characteristics of PHA-022121 and its active metabolite, PHA-022484 (M2-D). In mammalian cell lines, PHA-022121 and PHA-022484 show high affinity for the recombinant human bradykinin B<sub>2</sub> receptor with K<sub>i</sub> values of 0.47 and 0.70 nM, respectively, and potent antagonism of the human bradykinin B<sub>2</sub> receptor with K<sub>b</sub> values of 0.15 and 0.26 nM, respectively (calcium mobilization assay). Antagonist potency at the recombinant cynomolgus monkey bradykinin B<sub>2</sub> receptor is similarly high (K<sub>b</sub> values of 1.42 and 1.12 nM for PHA-022121 and PHA-022484, respectively), however, potency at rat, mouse, rabbit and dog bradykinin B<sub>2</sub> receptors is at least 100-fold lower than the potency at the human receptor for both compounds. In the human umbilical vein contractility assay, both PHA-022121 and PHA-022484 show a potent, surmountable and reversible B<sub>2</sub> antagonist activity with pA<sub>2</sub> values of 0.35 and 0.47 nM, respectively. The in vitro off-target profile of PHA-022121 and PHA-022484 demonstrates a high degree of selectivity over a wide range of molecular targets, including the bradykinin B<sub>1</sub> receptor. It is concluded that PHA-022121 is a novel, low-molecular weight, competitive antagonist of the human bradykinin B<sub>2</sub> receptor with high affinity, high antagonist potency, and high selectivity.

Thus, it is essential to develop antimicrobials. Here we synthesized a novel small-molecule compound, which we termed SYG-180-2-2 (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>16</sub>N<sub>2</sub>OSe), that had antibiofilm activity. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the antibiofilm effect of SYG-180-2-2 against clinical MRSA isolates at a subinhibitory concentration (4 μg/ml). In this study, it was showed that significant suppression in biofilm formation occurred with SYG-180-2-2 treatment, the inhibition ranged between 65.0 and 85.2%. Subsequently, confocal laser scanning microscopy and a bacterial biofilm metabolism activity assay further demonstrated that SYG-180-2-2 could suppress biofilm. Additionally, SYG-180-2-2 reduced bacterial adhesion and polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) production. It was found that the expression of <i>icaA</i> and other biofilm-related genes were downregulated as evaluated by RT-qPCR. At the same time, <i>icaR</i> and <i>codY</i> were upregulated when biofilms were treated with SYG-180-2-2. Based on the above results, we speculate that SYG-180-2-2 inhibits the formation of biofilm by affecting cell adhesion and the expression of genes related to PIA production. Above all, SYG-180-2-2 had no toxic effects on human normal alveolar epithelial cells BEAS-2B. Collectively, the small-molecule compound SYG-180-2-2 is a safe and effective antibacterial agent for inhibiting MRSA biofilm.",2022-01-07

Here, we have identified a novel small molecule that inhibited the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBDs and ACE2 by modulating ACE2 without impairing its enzymatic activity necessary for normal physiological functions. Furthermore, the identified compounds suppressed viral infection in cultured cells by inhibiting the entry of ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2. Our study suggests that targeting ACE2 could be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and prevent the development of COVID-19.",2022-02-01
35025968,EBV+ tumors exploit tumor cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms to produce regulatory T cell-recruiting chemokines CCL17 and CCL22.,"The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is involved in the etiology of multiple hematologic and epithelial human cancers. EBV+ tumors employ multiple immune escape mechanisms, including the recruitment of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg). Here, we show some EBV+ tumor cells express high levels of the chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 both in vitro and in vivo and that this expression mirrors the expression levels of expression of the EBV LMP1 gene in vitro. Patient samples from lymphoblastic (Hodgkin lymphoma) and epithelial (nasopharyngeal carcinoma; NPC) EBV+ tumors revealed CCL17 and CCL22 expression of both tumor cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic origin, depending on tumor type. NPCs grown as mouse xenografts likewise showed both mechanisms of chemokine production. Single cell RNA-sequencing revealed in vivo tumor cell-intrinsic CCL17 and CCL22 expression combined with expression from infiltrating classical resident and migratory dendritic cells in a CT26 colon cancer mouse tumor engineered to express LMP1. These data suggest that EBV-driven tumors employ dual mechanisms for CCL17 and CCL22 production. Importantly, both in vitro and in vivo Treg migration was effectively blocked by a novel, small molecule antagonist of CCR4, CCR4-351. Antagonism of the CCR4 receptor may thus be an effective means of activating the immune response against a wide spectrum of EBV+ tumors.",2022-01-13
35016500,Novel Peptide Motifs Containing Asp-Glu-Gly Target P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> and Thromboxane A2 Receptors to Inhibit Platelet Aggregation and Thrombus Formation.,"Increasing evidence has shown that collagen peptides have multiple biological activities. Our previous study has separated and identified antiplatelet aggregation peptides Asp-Glu-Gly-Pro (DEGP) from <i>Salmo salar</i> skin. This study is to investigate the cellular target of DEGP on platelets and its underlying mechanism. DEGP inhibited platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner induced by 2MeS-ADP and U46619 and significantly attenuated tail thrombosis formation by 30% in mice at the dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Mechanically, DEGP displayed apparent antagonism effects on TP and P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptors by the drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) technique to regulate the phosphorylation of RhoA<sup>S188</sup>, PLCβ3<sup>S537</sup>, as well as VASP<sup>S157</sup>. The molecular docking results revealed a stronger binding energy with the target protein of modified peptides DEGI and DDEGL. Practically, DEGI exhibited the highest inhibition activity against 2MeS-ADP- and U46619-induced platelet aggregation <i>in vitro</i> with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.88 ± 0.10 and 0.85 ± 0.10 mM, respectively, and comparable antithrombosis activity with aspirin at the dose of 25 mg/kg body weight <i>in vivo</i>. These results indicated the possibility that the peptide motifs containing Asp-Glu-Gly could potentially be developed as a novel therapeutic agent in the prevention and treatment of thrombotic diseases.",2022-01-12
35006491,Synthesis and Evaluation of Radioiodine-Labeled pH (Low) Insertion Peptide Variant 7-Like Peptide as a Noninvasive Tumor Microenvironment Imaging Agent in a Mouse MDA-MB-231 Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Model.,"The pH (low) insertion peptide (pHLIP) family can target the tumor microenvironment (TME). If pHLIP can be labeled with radioiodine, the imaging and treatment of tumors can be considered. However, tyrosine and tryptophan can bind with iodine in the insertion region of pHLIP, and radioiodine labeling may affect the formation of α-helix structures in acidic environments; therefore, it is necessary to adjust the structure of pHLIP. This study aims to develop an <sup>125</sup>I-labeled pH (low) insertion peptide variant 7-like peptide (pHLIP (Var7) LP) for imaging the TME in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenograft tumor models.",2022-01-10
34999227,Effect of hydrophobicity on distinct anticancer mechanism of antimicrobial peptide chensinin-1b and its lipoanalog PA-C1b in breast cancer cells.,"Chensinin-1b and its lipoanalogs demonstrate different anticancer activities against selected cancer cells, and the anticancer activity of PA-C1b is improved up to 3-fold compared with that of the parent peptide chensinin-1b. However, detailing the mechanism of action of these peptides is required to better understand the structure-function relationship. In this study, chensinin-1b and PA-C1b were selected as the representative peptides to investigate the mode of action in cancer cells. The results indicated that the boundary of the cell membrane was broken when the cells were treated with chensinin-1b, while that of cells treated with PA-C1b remained intact based on morphological changes. Apoptosis assays indicated that PA-C1b induced MCF-7 cancer cell apoptosis, while chensinin-1b mainly damaged the cell membrane. MCF-7 cancer cells treated with the peptides induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c was released from mitochondria, but PA-C1b enhanced ROS generation. Additionally, PA-C1b uptake occurred via an energy-dependent pathway and was inhibited by selected endocytosis inhibitors. Furthermore, treatment of MCF-7 cells with PA-C1b suppressed Bcl-2 mRNA levels and increased Bax mRNA levels, upregulated the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax and downregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results indicate that the anticancer mechanism of AMPs may be considerably affected by only a slight difference in the hydrophobicity of the two peptides; and such a study may facilitate the design of novel peptide-based anticancer agents.",2022-01-06
34996924,In vitro characterization of a small molecule PD-1 inhibitor that targets the PD-l/PD-L1 interaction.,"Targeting the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represents a crucial breakthrough in anticancer therapy, but mAbs are limited by their poor oral bioavailability, adverse events in multiple organ systems, and primary, adaptive, and acquired resistance, amongst other issues. More recently, the advent of small molecule inhibitors that target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have shown promising cellular inhibitory activity and the potential to counteract the disadvantages of mAbs. In this study, structure-based virtual screening identified small molecule inhibitors that effectively inhibited the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Six of those small molecule inhibitors were applied to cell-based experiments targeting PD-1: CH-1, CH-2, CH-3, CH-4, CH-5, and CH-6. Of all 6, CH-4 displayed the lowest cytotoxicity and strongest inhibitory activity towards the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. The experiments revealed that CH-4 inhibited the interaction of soluble form PD-L1 (sPD-L1) with PD-1 surface protein expressed by KG-1 cells. Investigations into CH-4 analogs revealed that CH-4.7 effectively blocked the PD-1/sPD-L1 interaction, but sustained the secretion of interleukin-2 and interferon-γ by Jurkat cells. Our experiments revealed a novel small molecule inhibitor that blocks the interaction of PD-1/sPD-L1 and potentially offers an alternative PD-1 target for immune checkpoint therapy.",2022-01-07
34990908,Local immune checkpoint blockade therapy by an adenovirus encoding a novel PD-L1 inhibitory peptide inhibits the growth of colon carcinoma in immunocompetent mice.,"A novel peptide that interferes with the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway, termed PD-L1 inhibitory peptide 3 (PD-L1ip3), was computationally designed, experimentally validated for its specific binding to PD-L1, and evaluated for its antitumor effects in cell culture and in a mouse colon carcinoma syngeneic murine model. In several cell culture studies, direct treatment with PD-L1ip3, but not a similar peptide with a scrambled sequence, substantially increased death of CT26 colon carcinoma cells when co-cultured with murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells primed by CT26 cell antigens. In a syngeneic mouse tumor model, the growth of CT26 tumor cells transduced with the PD-L1ip3 gene by an adenovirus vector was significantly slower than that of un-transduced CT26 cells in immunocompetent mice. This tumor growth attenuation was further enhanced by the coadministration of the peptide form of PD-L1ip3 (10 mg/kg/day). The current study suggests that this peptide can stimulate host antitumor immunity via blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby increasing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-induced death of colon carcinoma cells. The tumor site-specific inhibition of PD-L1 by an adenovirus carrying the PD-L1ip3 gene, together with direct peptide treatment, may be used as a local immune checkpoint blockade therapy to inhibit colon carcinoma growth.",2022-01-03
34985769,FPIA: A database for gene fusion profiling and interactive analyses.,"As one of the hallmarks of cancer, gene fusions play an important role in tumorigenesis, and have been established as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Although recent years have witnessed the development of gene fusion databases, a tool with interactive analytic functions remains lacking. Here, we introduce fusion profiling interactive analysis (FPIA), a web server to perform interactive and customizable analysis on fusion genes. With this platform, researchers can easily explore fusion-associated biological and molecular differences including gene expression, tumor purity and ploidy, mutation, copy number variations, protein expression, immune cell infiltration, stemness, telomere length, microsatellite instability, survival and novel peptides based on 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Currently, it contains 31 633 fusion events from 6910 patients. FPIA complements the existing gene fusion annotation databases with its multiomics analytic capacity, integrated analysis features, customized analysis selection and user-friendly design. The comprehensive data analyses by FPIA will greatly facilitate data mining, hypothesis generation and therapeutic target discovery. FPIA is available at http://bioinfo-sysu.com/fpia.",2022-02-05
34981929,Design and Evaluation of a Novel Peptide-Drug Conjugate Covalently Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Papain-like Protease.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a global health threat, was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro) was recognized as a promising drug target because of multiple functions in virus maturation and antiviral immune responses. Inhibitor GRL0617 occupied the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) C-terminus-binding pocket and showed an effective antiviral inhibition. Here, we described a novel peptide-drug conjugate (PDC), in which GRL0617 was linked to a sulfonium-tethered peptide derived from PLpro-specific substrate LRGG. The EM-C and EC-M PDCs showed a promising <i>in vitro</i> IC50 of 7.40 ± 0.37 and 8.63 ± 0.55 μM, respectively. EC-M could covalently label PLpro active site C111 and display anti-ISGylation activities in cellular assays. The results represent the first attempt to design PDCs composed of stabilized peptide inhibitors and GRL0617 to inhibit PLpro. These novel PDCs provide promising opportunities for antiviral drug design.",2022-01-04
34978144,Selective Binding of Small Molecules to Vibrio cholerae DsbA Offers a Starting Point for the Design of Novel Antibacterials.,"DsbA enzymes catalyze oxidative folding of proteins that are secreted into the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, and they are indispensable for the virulence of human pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli. Therefore, targeting DsbA represents an attractive approach to control bacterial virulence. X-ray crystal structures reveal that DsbA enzymes share a similar fold, however, the hydrophobic groove adjacent to the active site, which is implicated in substrate binding, is shorter and flatter in the structure of V. cholerae DsbA (VcDsbA) compared to E. coli DsbA (EcDsbA). The flat and largely featureless nature of this hydrophobic groove is challenging for the development of small molecule inhibitors. Using fragment-based screening approaches, we have identified a novel small molecule, based on the benzimidazole scaffold, that binds to the hydrophobic groove of oxidized VcDsbA with a K<sub>D</sub> of 446±10 μM. The same benzimidazole compound has ∼8-fold selectivity for VcDsbA over EcDsbA and binds to oxidized EcDsbA, with K<sub>D</sub> >3.5 mM. We generated a model of the benzimidazole complex with VcDsbA using NMR data but were unable to determine the structure of the benzimidazole bound EcDsbA using either NMR or X-ray crystallography. Therefore, a structural basis for the observed selectivity is unclear. To better understand ligand binding to these two enzymes we crystallized each of them in complex with a known ligand, the bile salt sodium taurocholate. The crystal structures show that taurocholate adopts different binding poses in complex with VcDsbA and EcDsbA, and reveal the protein-ligand interactions that stabilize the different modes of binding. This work highlights the capacity of fragment-based drug discovery to identify inhibitors of challenging protein targets. In addition, it provides a starting point for development of more potent and specific VcDsbA inhibitors that act through a novel anti-virulence mechanism.",2022-01-27
34978007,Investigation of the structure-activity relationship in a series of new LVV- and VV-hemorphin-7 analogues designed as potential anticonvulsant agents.,"In the present study, a series of new analogues of both LVV- and VV-hemorphin-7 have been synthesized and characterized. They were modified at the N- and C-terminus with varied amino acids (Ile, D-Leu, D-Val, D-Phe) and enantiopure chiral S- and R- α-aminophosphonic acids ((dimethoxyphosphoryl)methyl)-valine and ((dimethoxyphosphoryl) methyl)-leucine) to optimize the physicochemical properties and to enhance their anticonvulsant potency. The novel peptide analogues were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis-Fmoc-strategy. Their structure-property relationship was studied by FT-IR spectroscopy and electrochemical methods. The lipophilicity is also presented. The anticonvulsant activity of peptide analogues, administered intracerebroventricularly, at doses of 1, 2.5, and 5 μg/10 μL, respectively, was explored by 6-Hz psychomotor seizure test, maximal electroshock test (MES) and a timed intravenous pentylenetetrazole (ivPTZ) infusion test in mice. The potential neurological toxicity of the substances was checked by a rotarod test. The H7 was used as a positive control. The H7-1 peptide analogue was the most active molecule against the psychomotor seizures, while H7-6 and H7-7 showed comparable to the positive group H7 potency in the MES test. The H7-5 to H7-8 analogues at the two tested doses of 2.5 and 5 μg/10 μl raised the threshold against ivPTZ-induced myoclonic, clonic, and tonic seizures. None of the hemorphin analogues exhibited neurotoxicity in the rotarod test. In conclusion, our results suggest that modified at N- and C-terminus of certain amino acids in the hemorphin analogues have a crucial role as a basis to design new LVV- and VV-hemorphin-7 analogues for experimental and clinical use.",2022-01-03
34977908,Strategies to gain novel Alzheimer's disease diagnostics and therapeutics using modulators of ABCA transporters.,"Adenosine-triphosphate-(ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transport proteins are ubiquitously present membrane-bound efflux pumps that distribute endo- and xenobiotics across intra- and intercellular barriers. Discovered over 40 years ago, ABC transporters have been identified as key players in various human diseases, such as multidrug-resistant cancer and atherosclerosis, but also neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most prominent and well-studied are ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2, not only due to their contribution to the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in cancer, but also due to their contribution to AD. However, our understanding of other ABC transporters is limited, and most of the 49 human ABC transporters have been largely neglected as potential targets for novel small-molecule drugs. This is especially true for the ABCA subfamily, which contains several members known to play a role in AD initiation and progression. This review provides up-to-date information on the proposed functional background and pathological role of ABCA transporters in AD. We also provide an overview of small-molecules shown to interact with ABCA transporters as well as potential <i>in silico</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in vivo</i> methodologies to gain novel templates for the development of innovative ABC transporter-targeting diagnostics and therapeutics.",2021-12-13
34977208,Tigilanol Tiglate-Mediated Margins: A Comparison With Surgical Margins in Successful Treatment of Canine Mast Cell Tumours.,"Tigilanol tiglate (TT) is a novel small molecule registered as a veterinary pharmaceutical for intratumoural treatment of canine mast cell tumours (MCTs). The drug has a multifactorial mode of action resulting in rapid destruction of the treated tumour by haemorrhagic necrosis and subsequent slough of the necrotic tumour to reveal a tissue deficit that is left to heal by second intention with minimal to no veterinary intervention. Here we introduce the concept of TT-mediated margins, the calculated margin of tissue loss analogous to surgically applied margins to help clinicians conceptualise tissue deficits formed following tumour destruction by TT relative to surgical excision. We used data from 51 dogs that were recurrence-free 12 months after a single administered TT dose into a single target MCT <10 cm<sup>3</sup> in volume in a randomised, controlled clinical trial in the USA. We calculated TT-mediated margins based on length of the longest axis of (i) the tumour prior to treatment and (ii) the maximum tissue deficit formed 7-14 days after TT treatment. We compared these TT-mediated margins for each tumour to two surgical approaches to MCT excision in general practise: modified proportional margins (with 2 cm upper limit) and 3 cm fixed margins. For most dogs, TT-mediated margins were less than half the length of the margins calculated for the two surgical approaches in removing the same tumour. There was a trend for TT-mediated margins to increase with increasing tumour volume. Nonetheless, even for the larger tumours in this study (>2 cm<sup>3</sup> volume), 50% of TT-mediated margins were less than half the length of the two surgical margins. Eighteen cases were lower limb MCTs, sites often surgically challenging in veterinary practise. On these lower limbs, TT-mediated margins were less than half the length of the corresponding proportional margins in 56% of cases and larger than proportional margins in only two cases. This study suggests that, in many cases, smaller and more targeted margins could be expected when treating MCTs <10 cm<sup>3</sup> volume with TT compared with surgical excision. TT-mediated margins are a novel approach to conceptualise tissue deficits after intratumoural TT treatment.",2021-12-15
34977169,The Novel Peptide AEDPPE Alleviates Trophoblast Cell Dysfunction Associated With Preeclampsia by Regulating the NF-κB Signaling Pathway.,"<b>Background:</b> Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious risk to the health of pregnant women and fetuses during pregnancy, and there is no effective treatment for this condition. Although many reports have confirmed the therapeutic effects of peptides in diseases, the role of peptides in PE remains poorly understood. <b>Methods:</b> A differentially expressed peptide in PE (AEDPPE) is derived from heat-shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1), amino acids 100 to 109 (DVNHFAPDEL), which we identified in a previous study. We synthesized AEDPPE and investigated its effect on HTR-8/SVneo cell function using a Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometric assay, and Transwell and wound-healing assays. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and ELISA were used to determine cytokine expression. Pull-down assay, mass spectrometry, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence were used to explore the potential targets and signaling pathways regulated by AEDPPE. Finally, we assessed the effect of AEDPPE in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PE-like rat model. <b>Results:</b> AEDPPE significantly promoted the migration and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells, and it decreased the expression of interleukins 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8). These functions performed by AEDPPE remained evident after injury to HTR-8/SVneo cells with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and AEDPPE reversed the elevated sFlt-1/PlGF ratio induced by TNF-α. AEDPPE may exert these biological effects by binding to heat-shock protein 90β (HSP 90β) and, thus, affect the NF-κB signaling pathway. In an LPS-induced PE-like rat model, AEDPPE significantly improved PE symptoms and fetal rat outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study showed that AEDPPE enhanced trophoblast migration and invasion and reduced inflammatory cytokine expression, and we hypothesized that these actions involved the NF-κB signaling pathway. The use of AEDPPE may thus develop into a novel modality in the treatment of PE.",2021-12-17
34976858,Temperature-Dependent Influence of FliA Overexpression on PHL628 <i>E. coli</i> Biofilm Growth and Composition.,"Biofilm growth and survival pose a problem in both medical and industrial fields. Bacteria in biofilms are more tolerant to antibiotic treatment due to the inability of antibiotics to permeate to the bottom layers of cells in a biofilm and the creation of altered microenvironments of bacteria deep within the biofilm. Despite the abundance of information we have about <i>E. coli </i>biofilm growth and maturation, we are still learning how manipulating different signaling pathways influences the formation and fitness of biofilm. Understanding the impact of signaling pathways on biofilm formation may narrow the search for novel small molecule inhibitors or activators that affect biofilm production and stability. Here, we study the influence of the minor sigma transcription factor FliA (RpoF, sigma-28), which controls late-stage flagellar assembly and chemotaxis, on biofilm production and composition at various temperatures in the <i>E. coli</i> strain PHL628, which abundantly produces the extracellular structural protein curli. We examined FliA's influence on external cellular structures like curli and flagella and the biomolecular composition of the biofilm's extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) using biochemical assays, immunoblotting, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). At 37°C, FliA overexpression results in the dramatic growth of biofilm in polystyrene plates and more modest yet significant biofilm growth on silica slides. We observed no significant differences in curli concentration and carbohydrate concentration in the EPS with FliA overexpression. Still, we did see significant changes in the abundance of EPS protein using CLSM at higher growth temperatures. We also noticed increased flagellin concentration, a major structural protein in flagella, occurred with FliA overexpression, specifically in planktonic cultures. These experiments have aided in narrowing our focus to FliA's role in changing the protein composition of the EPS, which we will examine in future endeavors.",2021-12-17

34975482,Antimicrobial and Anti-inflammatory Effects of a Novel Peptide From the Skin of Frog <i>Microhyla pulchra</i>.,"Brevinins are an important antimicrobial peptide (AMP) family identified in the skin of <i>Ranidae</i> frogs and generally contain a characteristic ranabox structure at their C-terminal sequence. Herein a novel AMP named brevinin-2MP has been identified from the skin of the frog <i>Microhyla pulchra</i> by molecular cloning. Brevinin-2MP (GVITDTLKGVAKTVAAELLRKAHCKLTNSC) with a high amphipathic α-helix in sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions can destroy bacterial cell membrane and kill microbes. Furthermore, brevinin-2MP has been found to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of pro-inflammatory NO, MCP-1, IL-6, and TNF-α <i>via</i> binding unidentified targets on the cell membrane and consequently suppressing the activation of MAPK/NF-κB signaling cascades induced by LPS in RAW 264.7 cells. Consistently, brevinin-2MP significantly alleviates the acute inflammatory response in carrageenan-induced mice paw. In conclusion, brevinin-2MP with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties will be an ideal candidate drug molecule for bacterial inflammation treatment.",2021-12-16
36945694,<i>In silico</i> Immunogenicity Assessment for Sequences Containing Unnatural Amino Acids: A Method Using Existing <i>in silico</i> Algorithm Infrastructure and a Vision for Future Enhancements.,"The <i>in silico</i> prediction of T cell epitopes within any peptide or biologic drug candidate serves as an important first step for assessing immunogenicity. T cell epitopes bind human leukocyte antigen (HLA) by a well-characterized interaction of amino acid side chains and pockets in the HLA molecule binding groove. Immunoinformatics tools, such as the EpiMatrix algorithm, have been developed to screen natural amino acid sequences for peptides that will bind HLA. In addition to commonly occurring in synthetic peptide impurities, unnatural amino acids (UAA) are also often incorporated into novel peptide therapeutics to improve properties of the drug product. To date, the HLA binding properties of peptides containing UAA are not accurately estimated by most algorithms. Both scenarios warrant the need for enhanced predictive tools. The authors developed an <i>in silico</i> method for modeling the impact of a given UAA on a peptide's likelihood of binding to HLA and, by extension, its immunogenic potential. <i>In silico</i> assessment of immunogenic potential allows for risk-based selection of best candidate peptides in further confirmatory <i>in vitro, ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> assays, thereby reducing the overall cost of immunogenicity evaluation. Examples demonstrating <i>in silico</i> immunogenicity prediction for product impurities that are commonly found in formulations of the generic peptides teriparatide and semaglutide are provided. Next, this article discusses how HLA binding studies can be used to estimate the binding potentials of commonly encountered UAA and ""correct"" <i>in silico</i> estimates of binding based on their naturally occurring counterparts. As demonstrated here, these in vitro binding studies are usually performed with known ligands which have been modified to contain UAA in HLA anchor positions. An example using D-amino acids in relative binding position 1 (P1) of the PADRE peptide is presented. As more HLA binding data become available, new predictive models allowing for the direct estimation of HLA binding for peptides containing UAA can be established.",2022-10-10
34951320,Discovery of a novel class of small-molecule antibacterial agents against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.,"<b>Background:</b> With constantly increasing resistance against the known antibiotics, the search for novel antibacterial compounds is a challenge. The number of synthetic antibacterial agents is limited. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We discovered novel small-molecule antibacterial agents that are accessible <i>via</i> a simple two-step procedure. The evaluation against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> showed antibacterial effects depending on the substituent positioning at the residues of the molecular scaffold. Additionally, we investigated the potential of the compounds to increase the antibacterial activity of tetracycline. <b>Results:</b> The most effective antibacterial compounds possessed a 3-methoxy function at an aromatic residue. In combination with tetracycline, we found a strong effect for a few compounds in boosting the antibacterial activity, so the first promising lead compounds with dual activities could be identified.",2021-12-24

34944696,A Novel Peptide-MHC Targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Forms a T Cell-like Immune Synapse.,"Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a promising form of adoptive cell therapy that re-engineers patient-derived T cells to express a hybrid receptor specific to a tumour-specific antigen of choice. Many well-characterised tumour antigens are intracellular and therefore not accessible to antibodies at the cell surface. Therefore, the ability to target peptide-MHC tumour targets with antibodies is key for wider applicability of CAR T cell therapy in cancer. One way to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of ligating tumour target cells is studying the immune synapse. Here we generated a second-generation CAR to targeting the HLA-A*02:01 restricted H3.3K27M epitope, identified as a possible therapeutic target in ~75% of diffuse midline gliomas, used as a model antigen to study the immune synapse. The pMHCI-specific CAR demonstrated specificity, potent activation, cytokine secretion and cytotoxic function. Furthermore, we characterised killing kinetics using live cell imaging as well as CAR synapse confocal imaging. Here we provide evidence of robust CAR targeting of a model peptide-MHC antigen and that, in contrast to protein-specific CARs, these CARs form a TCR-like immune synapse which facilitates TCR-like killing kinetics.",2021-12-10
34939433,Machine learning and deep learning in data-driven decision making of drug discovery and challenges in high-quality data acquisition in the pharmaceutical industry.,"Predicting novel small molecule bioactivities for the target deconvolution, hit-to-lead optimization in drug discovery research, requires molecular representation. Previous reports have demonstrated that machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have substantial implications in virtual screening, peptide synthesis, drug ADMET screening and biomarker discovery. These strategies can increase the positive outcomes in the drug discovery process without false-positive rates and can be achieved in a cost-effective way with a minimum duration of time by high-quality data acquisition. This review substantially discusses the recent updates in AI tools as cheminformatics application in medicinal chemistry for the data-driven decision making of drug discovery and challenges in high-quality data acquisition in the pharmaceutical industry while improving small-molecule bioactivities and properties.",2021-12-23
34931190,A Pan-Respiratory Antiviral Chemotype Targeting a Host Multi-Protein Complex.,"We present a novel small molecule antiviral chemotype that was identified by an unconventional cell-free protein synthesis and assembly-based phenotypic screen for modulation of viral capsid assembly. Activity of PAV-431, a representative compound from the series, has been validated against infectious virus in multiple cell culture models for all six families of viruses causing most respiratory disease in humans. In animals this chemotype has been demonstrated efficacious for Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (a coronavirus) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (a paramyxovirus). PAV-431 is shown to bind to the protein 14-3-3, a known allosteric modulator. However, it only appears to target the small subset of 14-3-3 which is present in a dynamic multi-protein complex whose components include proteins implicated in viral lifecycles and in innate immunity. The composition of this target multi-protein complex appears to be modified upon viral infection and largely restored by PAV-431 treatment. Our findings suggest a new paradigm for understanding, and drugging, the host-virus interface, which leads to a new clinical therapeutic strategy for treatment of respiratory viral disease.",2023-12-12
34929517,"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation studies of novel small molecule ENPP1 inhibitors for cancer immunotherapy.","Ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 (ENPP1 or NPP1), is an attractive therapeutic target for various diseases, primarily cancer and mineralization disorders. The ecto-enzyme is located on the cell surface and has been implicated in the control of extracellular levels of nucleotide, nucleoside and (di) phosphate. Recently, it has emerged as a critical phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cyclic 2'3'- cGAMP, the endogenous ligand for STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes). STING plays an important role in innate immunity by activating type I interferon in response to cytosolic 2'3'-cGAMP. ENPP1 negatively regulates the STING pathway and hence its inhibition makes it an attractive therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we describe the design, optimization and biological evaluation studies of a series of novel non-nucleotidic thioguanine based small molecule inhibitors of ENPP1.

These compounds are a good starting point for the development of potentially effective cancer immunotherapy agents.",2021-12-11
34929154,Selective Targeting of the Novel CK-10 Nanoparticles to the MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells.,"The main objective of this project was to formulate novel decorated amphiphilic PLGA nanoparticles aiming for the selective delivery of the novel peptide (CK-10) to the cancerous/tumor tissue. Novel modified microfluidic techniques were used to formulate the nanoparticles. This technique was modified by using of Nano Assemblr associated with salting out of the organic solvent using K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. This modification is associated with higher peptide loading efficiencies, smaller size and higher uniformity. Size, zeta potential & qualitative determination of the adsorbed targeting ligands were measured by dynamic light scattering and laser anemometry techniques using the zeta sizer. Quantitative estimation of the adsorbed targeting ligands was done by colorimetry and spectrophotometric techniques. Qualitative and quantitative uptakes of the various PLGA nanoparticles were examined by the fluorescence microscope and the flow cytometer while the cytotoxic effect of the nanoparticles was measured by the colorimetric MTT assay. PLGA/poloxamer.FA, PLGA/poloxamer.HA, and PLGA/poloxamer.Tf have breast cancer MDA. MB321 cellular uptakes 83.8, 75.43 & 69.37 % which are higher than those of the PLGA/B cyclodextrin.FA, PLGA/B cyclodextrin.HA and PLGA/B cyclodextrin.Tf 80.87, 74.47 & 64.67 %. Therefore, PLGA/poloxamer.FA and PLGA/poloxamer.HA show higher cytotoxicity than PLGA/ poloxamer.Tf with lower breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell viabilities 30.74, 39.15 & 49.23 %, respectively. The design of novel decorated amphiphilic CK-10 loaded PLGA nanoparticles designed by the novel modified microfluidic technique succeeds in forming innovative anticancer formulations candidates for therapeutic use in aggressive breast cancers.",2021-12-17

This study aimed to develop a TRAIL-based nanotherapy that not only eliminated the extracellular matrix barrier to increase TRAIL delivery into tumours but also blocked antiapoptotic mechanisms to overcome TRAIL resistance in PDAC.",2021-12-17
34909478,MultiPep: a hierarchical deep learning approach for multi-label classification of peptide bioactivities.,"Peptide-based therapeutics are here to stay and will prosper in the future. A key step in identifying novel peptide-drugs is the determination of their bioactivities. Recent advances in peptidomics screening approaches hold promise as a strategy for identifying novel drug targets. However, these screenings typically generate an immense number of peptides and tools for ranking these peptides prior to planning functional studies are warranted. Whereas a couple of tools in the literature predict multiple classes, these are constructed using multiple binary classifiers. We here aimed to use an innovative deep learning approach to generate an improved peptide bioactivity classifier with capacity of distinguishing between multiple classes. We present MultiPep: a deep learning multi-label classifier that assigns peptides to zero or more of 20 bioactivity classes. We train and test MultiPep on data from several publically available databases. The same data are used for a hierarchical clustering, whose dendrogram shapes the architecture of MultiPep. We test a new loss function that combines a customized version of Matthews correlation coefficient with binary cross entropy (BCE), and show that this is better than using class-weighted BCE as loss function. Further, we show that MultiPep surpasses state-of-the-art peptide bioactivity classifiers and that it predicts known and novel bioactivities of FDA-approved therapeutic peptides. In conclusion, we present innovative machine learning techniques used to produce a peptide prediction tool to aid peptide-based therapy development and hypothesis generation.",2021-11-23
34908502,<i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Vivo</i> Studies on the Antibacterial Activity and Safety of a New Antimicrobial Peptide Dermaseptin-AC.,"Antimicrobial resistance has been an increasing public health threat in recent years. Antimicrobial peptides are considered as potential drugs against drug-resistant bacteria because they are mainly broad-spectrum and are unlikely to cause resistance. In this study, a novel peptide was obtained from the skin secretion of Agalychnis callidryas using the ""shotgun"" cloning method. The amino acid sequence, molecular weight, and secondary structure of Dermaseptin-AC were determined. The <i>in vitro</i> antimicrobial activity, hemolysis, and cytotoxicity of Dermaseptin-AC were evaluated. MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of Dermaseptin-AC against seven different bacterial strains ranged between 2 ∼ 4 μM and 2 ∼ 8 μM. The HC<sub>50</sub> (50% maximum hemolysis concentration) of Dermaseptin-AC against horse erythrocytes was 76.55 μM. The <i>in vivo</i> anti-MRSA effect was tested on immune-suppressed MRSA pneumonia in mice. Dermaseptin-AC showed anti-MRSA effects similar to the same dose of vancomycin (10 mg/kg body weight). Short-term (7 days of intraperitoneal injection, 10 mg/kg body weight) <i>in vivo</i> safety evaluation of Dermaseptin-AC was tested on mice. The survival rate during the 7-day injection was 80%. Dermaseptin-AC showed no obvious effect on the liver, heart, spleen, kidney, and blood, but did induce slight pulmonary congestion. The skin safety of Dermaseptin-AC was evaluated on wounds on the back skin of a rat, and no irritation was observed. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> In this study, we discovered a new antimicrobial peptide, Dermaseptin-AC, and studied its <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> antimicrobial activity. These studies provide some data for finding new antimicrobial peptides for overcoming antimicrobial resistance. Dermaseptin-AC showed strong broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and relatively low hemolysis, and was more cytotoxic to cancer cells than to normal cells. Dermaseptin-AC was active <i>in vivo</i>, and its anti-MRSA effect was similar to that of vancomycin when administered by intraperitoneal injection. Safety studies found that continuous injection of Dermaseptin-AC may cause mild pulmonary congestion, while there was no obvious irritation when it was applied to skin wounds. Chronic wounds are often accompanied by high bacterial burdens and, at the same time, antimicrobial resistance is more likely to occur during repeated infections and treatments. Therefore, developing Dermaseptin-AC to treat chronic wound infection may be an attractive choice.",2021-12-15
34906321,From computer-aided drug discovery to computer-driven drug discovery.,"Computational chemistry and structure-based design have traditionally been viewed as a subset of tools that could aid acceleration of the drug discovery process, but were not commonly regarded as a driving force in small molecule drug discovery. In the last decade however, there have been dramatic advances in the field, including (1) development of physics-based computational approaches to accurately predict a broad variety of endpoints from potency to solubility, (2) improvements in artificial intelligence and deep learning methods and (3) dramatic increases in computational power with the advent of GPUs and cloud computing, resulting in the ability to explore and accurately profile vast amounts of drug-like chemical space in silico. There have also been simultaneous advancements in structural biology such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and computational protein-structure prediction, allowing for access to many more high-resolution 3D structures of novel drug-receptor complexes. The convergence of these breakthroughs has positioned structurally-enabled computational methods to be a driving force behind the discovery of novel small molecule therapeutics. This review will give a broad overview of the synergies in recent advances in the fields of computational chemistry, machine learning and structural biology, in particular in the areas of hit identification, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization.",2021-08-30
34900747,Inhibition of SREBP-1 Activation by a Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor Enhances the Sensitivity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Tissue to Radiofrequency Ablation.,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an important strategy for treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the prognostic indicators of RFA therapy are not known, and there are few strategies for RFA sensitization. The transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP)-1 regulates fatty-acid synthesis but also promotes the proliferation or metastasis of HCC cells. Here, the clinical importance of SREBP-1 and potential application of knockdown of SREBP-1 expression in RFA of advanced HCC was elucidated. In patients with advanced HCC receiving RFA, a high level of endogenous SREBP-1 expression correlated to poor survival. Inhibition of SREBP-1 activation using a novel small-molecule inhibitor, SI-1, not only inhibited the aerobic glycolysis of HCC cells, it also enhanced the antitumor effects of RFA on xenograft tumors. Overall, our results: (i) revealed the correlation between SREBP-1 and HCC severity; (ii) indicated that inhibition of SREBP-1 activation could be a promising approach for treatment of advanced HCC.",2021-11-26
34893553,"Post-Stroke Administration of the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor Modulator, LM11A-31, Attenuates Chronic Changes in Brain Metabolism, Increases Neurotransmitter Levels, and Improves Recovery.","The aim of this study was to test whether poststroke oral administration of a small molecule p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) modulator (LM11A-31) can augment neuronal survival and improve recovery in a mouse model of stroke. Mice were administered LM11A-31 for up to 12 weeks, beginning 1 week after stroke. Metabolomic analysis revealed that after 2 weeks of daily treatment, mice that received LM11A-31 were distinct from vehicle-treated mice by principal component analysis and had higher levels of serotonin, acetylcholine, and dopamine in their ipsilateral hemisphere. LM11A-31 treatment also improved redox homeostasis by restoring reduced glutathione. It also offset a stroke-induced reduction in glycolysis by increasing acetyl-CoA. There was no effect on cytokine levels in the infarct. At 13 weeks after stroke, adaptive immune cell infiltration in the infarct was unchanged in LM11A-31-treated mice, indicating that LM11A-31 does not alter the chronic inflammatory response to stroke at the site of the infarct. However, LM11A-31-treated mice had less brain atrophy, neurodegeneration, tau pathology, and microglial activation in other regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere. These findings correlated with improved recovery of motor function on a ladder test, improved sensorimotor and cognitive abilities on a nest construction test, and less impulsivity in an open field test. These data support small molecule modulation of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> for preserving neuronal health and function during stroke recovery. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The findings from this study introduce the p75 neurotrophin receptor as a novel small molecule target for promotion of stroke recovery. Given that LM11A-31 is in clinical trials as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease, it could be considered as a candidate for assessment in stroke or vascular dementia studies.",2021-12-10

In the current study, we report the discovery of a series of 6-sulfonylamide-pyrano [2,3-c]-pyrazole derivatives as novel RalA inhibitors. ELISA-based biochemical assay results indicated that compounds <b>4k</b>-<b>4r</b> suppressed RalA/B binding capacities to their substrates. Cellular proliferation assays indicated that these RalA inhibitors potently inhibited the proliferation of HCC cell lines, including HepG2, SMMC-7721, Hep3B, and Huh-7 cells. Among the evaluated compounds, <b>4p</b> displayed good inhibitory capacities on RalA (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.22 μM) and HepG2 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.28 μM).

34867354,A Novel ELISA-Based Peptide Biosensor Assay for Screening ABL1 Activity <i>in vitro</i>: A Challenge for Precision Therapy in BCR-ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 Like Leukemias.,"The pathogenic role of the overactivated ABL1 tyrosine kinase (TK) pathway is well recognized in some forms of <i>BCR-ABL1</i> like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); TK inhibitors represent a useful therapeutic choice in these patients who respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy. Here we report a novel peptide biosensor (P<sub>ABL</sub>)-ELISA assay to investigate ABL1 activity in four immortalized leukemic cell lines with different genetic background. The P<sub>ABL</sub> sequence comprises an ABL1 tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation site and a targeting sequence that increases the specificity for ABL1; additional peptides (Y-site-mutated (P<sub>ABL</sub>-<sub>F</sub>) and fully-phosphorylated (P<sub>PHOSPHO</sub>-<sub>ABL</sub>) biosensors) were included in the assay. After incubation with whole cell lysates, average P<sub>ABL</sub> phosphorylation was significantly increased (basal vs. P<sub>ABL</sub> phosphorylation: 6.84 ± 1.46% vs. 32.44 ± 3.25%, <i>p</i>-value < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test, percentages relative to P<sub>PHOSPHO</sub>-<sub>ABL</sub> in each cell line). Cell lines expressing ABL1-chimeric proteins (K562, ALL-SIL) presented the higher TK activity on P<sub>ABL</sub>; a lower signal was instead observed for NALM6 and REH (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> < 0.05 vs. K562, respectively). Phosphorylation was ABL1-mediated, as demonstrated by the specific inhibition of imatinib (<i>p</i> < 0.001 for K562, NALM6, ALL-SIL and <i>p</i> < 0.01 for REH) in contrast to ruxolitinib (JAK2-inhibitor), and occurred on the ABL1 Y-site, as demonstrated by P<sub>ABL-F</sub> whose phosphorylation was comparable to basal levels. In order to validate this novel P<sub>ABL</sub>-ELISA assay on leukemic cells isolated from patient's bone marrow aspirates, preliminary analysis on blasts derived from an adult affected by chronic myeloid leukaemia (<i>BCR-ABL1</i> positive) and a child affected by ALL (<i>BCR-ABL1</i> negative) were performed. Phosphorylation of P<sub>ABL</sub> was specifically inhibited after the incubation of <i>BCR-ABL1</i> positive cell lysates with imatinib, but not with ruxolitinib. While requiring further optimization and validation in leukemic blasts to be of clinical interest, the P<sub>ABL</sub>-based ELISA assay provides a novel <i>in vitro</i> tool for screening both the aberrant ABL1 activity in <i>BCR-ABL1</i> like ALL leukemic cells and their potential response to TK inhibitors.",2021-11-19
34854056,Novel peptide-based inhibitor for targeted inhibition of T cell function.,"Novel immunosuppressants are sought to overcome the side effects of currently used drugs. T cells play a central role in the functioning of the immune system; hence, drugs that specifically inhibit T cell function are expected to be better immunosuppressants with fewer side effects than the ones currently used. Peptides that interfere with crucial protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been shown to influence cell physiology and have therapeutic potential. In this study, we designed a peptide, GVITAA, which specifically inhibits the function of lymphocyte-specific protein kinase (LCK), a signaling molecule that is mainly expressed in T cells and is responsible for positively regulating T cell function. Aspartate Histidine -Histidine Cysteine (DHHC21) -LCK is an important PPI present in T cells; DHHC21 interacts with LCK and targets the kinase to membrane rafts by adding a palmitoyl group. GVITAA is a ten amino acid peptide that interferes with the DHHC21-LCK interaction, prevents the membrane localization of LCK, and inhibits LCK-mediated initiation of complex signal transduction pathways required for T cell activation. In this study, we present evidence that the GVITAA peptide when conjugated with a cell-penetrating peptide-human immunodeficiency virus transactivator of transcription (TAT) and incubated with mouse T cells specifically inhibits LCK-mediated T cell receptor signaling, cytokine secretion, and T cell proliferation. This peptide does not affect other non-T cell functions and is non-toxic. A similar strategy was also tested and demonstrated in human peripheral T cells.",2021-12-01
34839997,Discovery of quinazoline derivatives as novel small-molecule inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) interaction.,"Development of small molecule PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as a novel immunotherapy strategy exhibits great promise. Herein, a novel series of quinazoline derivatives were designed, synthesized and their inhibitory activity against the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction was evaluated through a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay. Among them, the compound 39 exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.57 nM. Furthermore, the cellular level assays revealed that 39 could inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and restore T-cell function, and showed low toxicity on the PBMCs. In addition, the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of the novel quinazoline derivatives were explored and the binding mode of 39 with dimeric PD-L1 was analyzed by molecular docking. This work demonstrates that incorporation of pyrimidine group between the 2 and 3-positions of the biphenyl structure is an effective strategy for designing novel and more potent small molecule PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, and 39 can be regarded as a promising lead compound for further investigation.",2021-11-18
34834387,Smart Nanotherapeutics and Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is a significant health problem worldwide. Unfortunately, current therapeutic strategies lack a sufficient level of specificity and can harm adjacent healthy cells. Consequently, to address the clinical need, novel approaches to improve treatment efficiency with minimal side effects are required. Nanotechnology can substantially contribute to the generation of differentiated products and improve patient outcomes. Evidence from previous research suggests that nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems could provide a promising platform for the targeted delivery of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs and novel small molecule therapeutic agents to treat lung cancer cells more effectively. This has also been found to improve the therapeutic index and reduce the required drug dose. Nanodrug delivery systems also provide precise control over drug release, resulting in reduced toxic side effects, controlled biodistribution, and accelerated effects or responses. This review highlights the most advanced and novel nanotechnology-based strategies, including targeted nanodrug delivery systems, stimuli-responsive nanoparticles, and bio-nanocarriers, which have recently been employed in preclinical and clinical investigations to overcome the current challenges in lung cancer treatments.",2021-11-20
34832916,Novel Small Molecule Inhibitors That Prevent the Neuroparalysis of Tetanus Neurotoxin.,"Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) is a protein exotoxin produced by <i>Clostridium tetani</i> that causes the deadly spastic neuroparalysis of tetanus. It consists of a metalloprotease light chain and of a heavy chain linked via a disulphide bond. TeNT binds to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and it is retro-axonally transported into vesicular compartments to the spinal cord, where it is released and taken up by inhibitory interneuron. Therein, the catalytic subunit is translocated into the cytoplasm where it cleaves its target protein VAMP-1/2 with consequent blockage of the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. Vaccination with formaldehyde inactivated TeNT prevents the disease, but tetanus is still present in countries where vaccination coverage is partial. Here, we show that small molecule inhibitors interfering with TeNT trafficking or with the reduction of the interchain disulphide bond block the activity of the toxin in neuronal cultures and attenuate tetanus symptoms in vivo. These findings are relevant for the development of therapeutics against tetanus based on the inhibition of toxin molecules that are being retro-transported to or are already within the spinal cord and are, thus, not accessible to anti-TeNT immunoglobulins.",2021-11-08
34831131,Novel Peptide Therapeutic Approaches for Cancer Treatment.,"Peptides are increasingly being developed for use as therapeutics to treat many ailments, including cancer. Therapeutic peptides have the advantages of target specificity and low toxicity. The anticancer effects of a peptide can be the direct result of the peptide binding its intended target, or the peptide may be conjugated to a chemotherapy drug or radionuclide and used to target the agent to cancer cells. Peptides can be targeted to proteins on the cell surface, where the peptide-protein interaction can initiate internalization of the complex, or the peptide can be designed to directly cross the cell membrane. Peptides can induce cell death by numerous mechanisms including membrane disruption and subsequent necrosis, apoptosis, tumor angiogenesis inhibition, immune regulation, disruption of cell signaling pathways, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair pathways, or cell death pathways. Although using peptides as therapeutics has many advantages, peptides have the disadvantage of being easily degraded by proteases once administered and, depending on the mode of administration, often have difficulty being adsorbed into the blood stream. In this review, we discuss strategies recently developed to overcome these obstacles of peptide delivery and bioavailability. In addition, we present many examples of peptides developed to fight cancer.",2021-10-27
34823004,Modulating CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing activity by small molecules.,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-mediated genome engineering has become a standard procedure for creating genetic and epigenetic changes of DNA molecules in basic biology, biotechnology, and medicine. However, its versatile applications have been hampered by its overall low precise gene modification efficiency and uncontrollable prolonged Cas9 activity. Therefore, overcoming these problems could broaden the therapeutic use of CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies. Here, we review small molecules with the clinical potential to precisely modulate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-editing activity and discuss their mechanisms of action. Based on these data, we suggest that direct-acting small molecules for Cas9 are more suitable for precisely regulating Cas9 activity. These findings provide useful information for the identification of novel small-molecule enhancers and inhibitors of Cas9 and Cas9-associated endonucleases.",2021-11-22

Thymoquinone (TQ) is an important and active component isolated from N. sativa seeds. Inhibition of cancer-associated activating PIK3CA mutations is a new prospective targeted therapy in personalized metastatic breast cancer (MBC). TQ is reported to be an effective inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt1 pathway in MBC. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antitumor effect of TQ in the context of two PIK3CA hotspot mutations, p.

34816323,Chemical screening identifies novel small molecule activators of natural killer cell cytotoxicity against cancer cells.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that play a major role in the innate immune system. NK cells exhibit potent cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and virally infected cells without antigen priming. These unique cytotoxic properties make NK cells a promising therapeutic against cancer. Limitations of NK cell therapy include deficiencies in high clinical efficacy often due to a need for a high NK cell to target cell ratio to achieve effective killing. In order to address the suboptimal efficacy of current adoptive NK cell therapy, a high throughput screen (HTS) was designed and performed to identify drug-like compounds that increase NK cytotoxic activity against tumor cells without affecting the normal cells. This screen was performed in a 384-well plate format utilizing an expanded primary NK cell product and ovarian cancer cells as a target cell (TC) line. Of the 8000 diverse small molecules screened, 16 hits were identified (0.2% hit rate) based on both a robust Z (RZ) score < -3 and a greater than 10% increase in NK cell killing. A validation screen had a confirmation rate of 70%. Select compounds were further validated and characterized by additional cytotoxicity assays including activity against multiple blood cancer and solid tumor cell lines, with no effect on primary human T cells. This work demonstrates that high-throughput screening can be reliably used to identify compounds that increase NK tumoricidal activity in vitro that can be further investigated and translated for potential clinical application. Précis: Our work led to the identification of promising compound that potently increases NK cell-mediated killing of a variety of different cancer cells, but no impact on the killing of normal cells. This compound demonstrates the utility of this assay.",2021-11-23

34793977,Small-molecule drugs for cystic fibrosis: Where are we now?,"The cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is due to the lack/dysfunction of the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel expressed by epithelial cells as the main regulator of ion and fluid homeostasis. More than 2000 genetic variation in the CFTR gene are known, among which those with identified pathomechanism have been divided into six mutation classes. A major advancement in the pharmacotherapy of CF has been the development of small-molecule drugs hitting the root of the disease, i.e. the altered ion and fluid transport through the airway epithelium. These drugs, called CFTR modulators, have been advanced to the clinics to treat nearly 90% of CF patients, including the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor, approved for residual function mutations (Classes III and IV), and combinations of correctors (lumacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor) and ivacaftor for patients bearing at least one the F508del mutation, the most frequent mutation belonging to class II. To cover the 10% of CF patients without etiological therapies, other novel small-molecule CFTR modulators are in evaluation of their effectiveness in all the CFTR mutation classes: read-through agents for Class I, correctors, potentiators and amplifiers from different companies for Class II-V, stabilizers for Class VI. In alternative, other solute carriers, such as SLC26A9 and SLC6A14, are the focus of intensive investigation. Finally, other molecular targets are being evaluated for patients with no approved CFTR modulator therapy or as means of enhancing CFTR modulatory therapy, including small molecules forming ion channels, inhibitors of the ENaC sodium channel and potentiators of the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A. This paper aims to give an up-to-date overview of old and novel CFTR modulators as well as of novel strategies based on small-molecule drugs. Further investigations in in-vivo and cell-based models as well as carrying out large prospective studies will be required to determine if novel CFTR modulators, stabilizers, amplifiers, and the ENaC inhibitors or TMEM16A potentiators will further improve the clinical outcomes in CF management.",2021-11-15
34786070,A novel silicone derivative of natural osalmid (DCZ0858) exerts anti-multiple myeloma activity by promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell cycle and mTOR signaling.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disease characterized by abnormal proliferation of clonal plasma cells. Based on the organic drug osalmid, the novel small molecule compound DCZ0858 was designed and synthesized for treating MM. DCZ0858 inhibited the proliferation and activity of MM cells and reduced colony formation. It also promoted the apoptosis of primary cells from patients with MM and cultured MM cell lines but had little effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in healthy people. Simultaneously, DCZ0858 activated caspase family proteins, blocked MM cells in G0/G1 phase, and reduced the expression of related cyclins CDK4/6 and CyclinD1. Moreover, DCZ0858 overcame the protective effect of the bone marrow microenvironment and effectively inhibited the activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Further, xenograft model experiments in mice showed that DCZ0858 significantly inhibited the proliferation and growth of tumors, with low drug toxicity. These results indicate that DCZ0858 has marked anti-MM activity and little effect on normal cells and tissues, making it a new candidate clinical drug for the treatment of MM.",2021-10-15
34783444,Fully Reduced HMGB1-Containing Peptide-Based Polyurethane Scaffold with Minimal Functional Unit of Skin (MFUS) Enhances Large and Deep Wounded Skin Healing.,"A novel peptide-based polymer is developed by lysine-diisocyanate (LDI), glycerol (Gly), and fully reduced HMGB1 (frHMGB1). This frHMGB1-LDI-Gly polymer either forms sponge-like foam (scaffold) or a hydrogel or a film under different reaction conditions. It degrades into nontoxic lysine, glycerol, and frHMGB1. The hydrogel glues tissues together and the glued tissues have strong mechanical properties. The film and scaffold provide the suitable environment for enhancing cell proliferation by releasing frHMGB1. The scaffold carries 1 mm diameter of full-thickness rat skin-island as a minimal functional unit of skin (MFUS) to treat large full thickness skin wounds, and the hydrogel glues the MFUS and scaffold with skin edges together (MFUS+Scaffold group). The scaffold treated wounds (Scaffold group) heal much faster than the wounds either treated with MFUS (MFUS group) or without treatment (Wound group). The MFUS+Scaffold treated wound regenerates more functional full-thickness skin with more hair follicles and sweat glands, higher CD146 and α-smooth muscle actin levels, more blood vessels and collagen productions, and less scar tissues when compared to the other three groups. The results demonstrate that the combination of frHMGB1-LDI-Gly polymer with MFUS provides a new tissue engineering approach for large full-thickness skin wound healing.",2021-11-16
34771675,Advances in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Treatment.,"Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies among all cancers. Despite curative intent, surgery and the use of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy, PDAC remains treatment-resistant. In recent years, more contemporary treatment modalities such as immunotherapy via checkpoint inhibition have shown some promise in many other malignancies, yet PDAC still eludes an effective curative treatment. In investigating these phenomena, research has suggested that the significant desmoplastic and adaptive tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDAC promote the proliferation of immunosuppressive cells and act as major obstacles to treatment efficacy. In this review, we explore challenges associated with the treatment of PDAC, including its unique immunosuppressive TME. This review examines the role of surgery in PDAC, recent advances in surgical approaches and surgical optimization. We further focus on advances in immunotherapeutic approaches, including checkpoint inhibition, CD40 agonists, and discuss promising immune-based future strategies, such as therapeutic neoantigen cancer vaccines as means of overcoming the resistance mechanisms which underly the dense stroma and immune milieu of PDAC. We also explore unique signaling, TME and stromal targeting via novel small molecule inhibitors, which target KRAS, FAK, CCR2/CCR5, CXCR4, PARP and cancer-associated fibroblasts. This review also explores the most promising strategy for advancement in treatment of pancreatic cancer by reviewing contemporary combinatorial approaches in efforts to overcome the treatment refractory nature of PDAC.",2021-11-03
34770963,Size and Structure of Empty and Filled Nanocontainer Based on Peptide Dendrimer with Histidine Spacers at Different pH.,"Novel peptide dendrimer with Lys-2His repeating units was recently synthesized, studied by NMR (Molecules, 2019, 24, 2481) and tested as a nanocontainer for siRNA delivery (Int. J. Mol. Sci., 2020, 21, 3138). Histidine amino acid residues were inserted in the spacers of this dendrimer. Increase of their charge with a pH decrease turns a surface-charged dendrimer into a volume-charged one and should change all properties. In this paper, the molecular dynamics simulation method was applied to compare the properties of the dendrimer in water with explicit counterions at two different pHs (at normal pH with neutral histidines and at low pH with fully protonated histidines) in a wide interval of temperatures. We obtained that the dendrimer at low pH has essentially larger size and size fluctuations. The electrostatic properties of the dendrimers are different but they are in good agreement with the theoretical soft sphere model and practically do not depend on temperature. We have shown that the effect of pairing of side imidazole groups is much stronger in the dendrimer with neutral histidines than in the dendrimer with protonated histidines. We also demonstrated that the capacity of a nanocontainer based on this dendrimer with protonated histidines is significantly larger than that of a nanocontainer with neutral histidines.",2021-10-29
34765320,"Multiple functions of the DEAD-box RNA helicase, DDX5 (p68), make DDX5 a superior oncogenic biomarker and target for targeted cancer therapy.","DDX5 (p68) is a well-known multifunctional DEAD-box RNA helicase and a transcription cofactor. Since its initial discovery more than three decades ago, DDX5 is gradually recognized as a potential biomarker and target for the treatment of various cancer types. Studies over the years significantly expanded our understanding of the functional diversity of DDX5 in various cancer types and extended our knowledge of its Mechanism of Action (MOA). This provides a rationale for the development of novel cancer therapeutics by using DDX5 as a biomarker and a therapeutic target. However, while most of the published studies have found DDX5 to be an oncogenic target and a cancer treatment-resistant biomarker, a few studies have reported that in certain scenarios, DDX5 may act as a tumor suppressor. After careful review of all the available relevant studies in the literature, we found that the multiple functions of DDX5 make it both a superior independent oncogenic biomarker and target for targeted cancer therapy. In this article, we will summarize the relevant studies on DDX5 in literature with a careful analysis and discussion of any inconsistencies encountered, and then provide our conclusions with respect to understanding the MOA of FL118, a novel small molecule. We hope that such a review will stimulate further discussion on this topic and assist in developing better strategies to treat cancer by using DDX5 as both an oncogenic biomarker and therapeutic target.",2021-10-15
34760374,A novel role for apatinib in enhancing radiosensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer cells by suppressing the AKT and ERK pathways.,Radioresistance is still the major cause of radiotherapy failure and poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Apatinib (AP) is a highly selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Whether and how AP affects radiosensitivity in NSCLC remains unknown. The present study aimed to explore the radiosensitization effect of AP in NSCLC and its underlying mechanism as a radiosensitizer.,2021-10-28
34740232,A functional and self-assembling octyl-phosphonium-tagged esculetin as an effective siRNA delivery agent.,"Herein, we document a self-assembling octyl-TPP tagged esculetin (Mito-Esc) as functionally active and as a novel small molecule siRNA delivery vector. While Mito-Esc itself induces selective breast cancer cell death, the amphiphilic nature of Mito-Esc delivers therapeutic siRNAs intracellularly without the need for any excipient to exacerbate the anti-proliferative effects.",2021-11-19
34737451,Dystrophin and mini-dystrophin quantification by mass spectrometry in skeletal muscle for gene therapy development in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, degenerative muscle disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, leading to severe reduction or absence of the protein dystrophin. Gene therapy strategies that aim to increase expression of a functional dystrophin protein (mini-dystrophin) are under investigation. The ability to accurately quantify dystrophin/mini-dystrophin is essential in assessing the level of gene transduction. We demonstrated the validation and application of a novel peptide immunoaffinity liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (IA-LC-MS/MS) assay. Data showed that dystrophin expression in Becker muscular dystrophy and DMD tissues, normalized against the mean of non-dystrophic control tissues (n = 20), was 4-84.5% (mean 32%, n = 20) and 0.4-24.1% (mean 5%, n = 20), respectively. In a DMD rat model, biceps femoris tissue from dystrophin-deficient rats treated with AAV9.hCK.Hopti-Dys3978.spA, an adeno-associated virus vector containing a mini-dystrophin transgene, showed a dose-dependent increase in mini-dystrophin expression at 6 months post-dose, exceeding wildtype dystrophin levels at high doses. Validation data showed that inter- and intra-assay precision were ≤20% (≤25% at the lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]) and inter- and intra-run relative error was within ±20% (±25% at LLOQ). IA-LC-MS/MS accurately quantifies dystrophin/mini-dystrophin in human and preclinical species with sufficient sensitivity for immediate application in preclinical/clinical trials.",2021-11-05
34734460,Novel small molecule inhibition of IKK/NF-κB activation reduces markers of senescence and improves healthspan in mouse models of aging.,"Constitutive NF-κB activation is associated with cellular senescence and stem cell dysfunction and rare variants in NF-κB family members are enriched in centenarians. We recently identified a novel small molecule (SR12343) that inhibits IKK/NF-κB activation by disrupting the association between IKKβ and NEMO. Here we investigated the therapeutic effects of SR12343 on senescence and aging in three different mouse models. SR12343 reduced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity in oxidative stress-induced senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as in etoposide-induced senescent human IMR90 cells. Chronic administration of SR12343 to the Ercc1<sup>-/</sup><sup>∆</sup> and Zmpste24<sup>-/-</sup> mouse models of accelerated aging reduced markers of cellular senescence and SASP and improved multiple parameters of aging. SR12343 also reduced markers of senescence and increased muscle fiber size in 2-year-old WT mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway represents a promising target for reducing markers of cellular senescence, extending healthspan and treating age-related diseases.",2021-11-03
34731743,Estimation of ZYKR1 in human urine and plasma utilizing LC-MS/MS positive electrospray ionization; a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist.,"ZYKR1, a short chain novel peptide with selective kappa opioid receptor agonist activity used as analgesics for the treatment of pain management. A sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS assay was developed and validated for estimation of ZYKR1 in human urine and plasma. ZY17258, an analogue compound was used as an internal standard. ZYKR1 was quantified using a selective reaction monitoring in electrospray ionization positive mode. The chromatographic separation was performed using mobile phase consisted of 0.05% v/v formic acid in water and methanol in gradient elution by analytical column Kinetex C<sub>8</sub>, 100 A°, 5 µm, 100 × 4.6 mm with 8.0 min analytical run time. Solid Phase extraction technique was used for purification of ZYKR1 and IS from human urine and plasma. The calibration curves were linear over range of 0.300 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL and 0.500 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL for human urine and plasma, respectively. No matrix effect and no significant carryover were observed. The extraction recovery was consistent and ranged from about 85% to 93% in human urine and in plasma respectively. Inter-day and intra-day accuracy (bias, %) and precision (CV, %) was -11.11 to 5.91 % and -2.25 to 6.65 % in human urine and -2.74 to 7.17 % and 2.24 to 15.18 % in plasma respectively were well within the acceptance criteria. Both the assays were devoid of endogenous matrix interference and commonly used concomitant drug interference. The validated assays were used for estimation of ZYKR1 from clinical pharmacokinetic study sample bioanalysis in healthy human subjects.",2021-10-24
34722644,A Novel OGR1 (GPR68) Inhibitor Attenuates Inflammation in Murine Models of Colitis.,"Local extracellular acidification is associated with several conditions, such as ischemia, cancer, metabolic disease, respiratory diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several recent studies reported a link between IBD and a family of pH-sensing G protein-coupled receptors. Our previous studies point to an essential role for OGR1 (GPR68) in the modulation of intestinal inflammation and fibrosis. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of a novel OGR1 inhibitor in murine models of colitis.",2021-07-19
34717237,"Design, synthesis and binding mode of interaction of novel small molecule o-hydroxy benzamides as HDAC3-selective inhibitors with promising antitumor effects in 4T1-Luc breast cancer xenograft model.","Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is one of the most promising targets to develop anticancer therapeutics. In continuation of our quest for selective HDAC3 inhibitors, a series of small molecules having o-hydroxy benzamide as the novel zinc binding group (ZBG) has been introduced for the first time that can be able to produce good HDAC3-selectivity over other HDACs. The most promising HDAC3 inhibitors, 11a and 12b, displayed promising in vitro anticancer activities with less toxicity to normal kidney cells. These compounds significantly upregulate histone acetylation and induce apoptosis with a G2/M phase arrest in B16F10 cells. Compound 11a exhibited potent antitumor efficacy in 4T1-Luc breast cancer xenograft mouse model in female Balb/c mice. It also showed significant tumor growth suppression with no general toxicity and extended survival rates post-tumor resection. It significantly induced higher ROS generation, leading to apoptosis. No considerable toxicity was noticed in major organs isolated from the compound 11a-treated mice. Compound 11a also induced the upregulation of acH3K9, acH4K12, caspase-3 and caspase-7 as analyzed by immunoblotting with treated tumor tissue. Overall, HDAC3 selective inhibitor 11a might be a potential lead for the clinical translation as an emerging drug candidate.",2021-10-22

34689062,Identification of a novel peptide that activates alcohol dehydrogenase from crucian carp swim bladder and how it protects against acute alcohol-induced liver injury in mice.,"Alcoholism is a severe threat to public health, and there are no adequate treatments for alcoholic liver disease. The aim of this study was to identify bioactive peptides derived from natural proteins that prevent acute alcohol-induced liver injury. We identified a peptide with the sequence Gly-Leu-hydroxyproline-Gly-Glu-Arg (GLpGER) from the hydrolysate of crucian carp swim bladder using size-exclusion chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. The in vitro EC<sub>50</sub> value of GLpGER to activate alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was 137.9 ± 9 µM. Molecular docking experiments indicated that the mechanism by which GLpGER activates ADH may be related to the formation of stable complexes with ADH active pockets through hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Oral administration of GLpGER one hour before acute alcohol ingestion significantly increased alcohol metabolism, manifesting as reduced incidence of the loss of righting reflex, increased alcohol tolerance time, shortened sobering time, and decreased blood alcohol concentration level. GLpGER restored liver ADH activity, maintained the typical morphology of hepatocytes, and reduced serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. These findings suggest that GLpGER might reduce acute alcohol-induced liver injury and may have the potential to be developed as an anti-inebriation ingredient.",2021-10-12
34685842,Chemical Constituents of the Leaves of <i>Diospyros kaki</i> (Persimmon).,"<i>Diospyros kaki</i> (persimmon) leaves have long been utilized as traditional medicine for the treatment of ischemic stroke, angina, and hypertension and as a healthy beverage and cosmetic for anti-aging. This study aimed to isolate as many compounds as possible from an ethanol extract of the persimmon leaves to identify the biologically active compounds. The antioxidative effect of the ethyl acetate layer from the ethanol extract of the persimmon leaves was demonstrated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and online high-performance liquid chromatography-2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (HPLC-ABTS) analysis. A new flavonoid, kaempferol-3-<i>O</i>-<i>β</i>-d-2″-coumaroylgalactoside (<b>1</b>), and a new natural compound, kaempferol-3-<i>O</i>-<i>β</i>-d-2″-feruloylglucoside (<b>3</b>) were isolated from the ethyl acetate layer, along with 25 previously known compounds, including fourteen flavonoids, one ionone, two coumarins, seven triterpenoids, and one acetophenone.

All isolated compounds were rapidly evaluated using an online HPLC-ABTS assay, and of these, compounds <b>4</b>-<b>8</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b> clearly showed antioxidative effects. The amount of these compounds was 0.3-0.65% of the extract.",2021-09-28
34678732,A novel GPR119 agonist DA-1241 preserves pancreatic function via the suppression of ER stress and increased PDX1 expression.,"DA-1241 is a novel small molecule G protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119) agonist in early clinical development for type 2 diabetic patients. This study aimed to elucidate the pharmacological characteristics of DA-1241 for its hypoglycemic action. DA-1241 potently and selectively activated GPR119 with enhanced maximum efficacy. DA-1241 increased intracellular cAMP in HIT-T15 insulinoma cells (EC<sub>50</sub>, 14.7 nM) and increased insulin secretion (EC<sub>50</sub>, 22.3 nM) in association with enhanced human insulin promoter activity. Accordingly, postprandial plasma insulin levels were increased in mice after single oral administration of DA-1241. Postprandial glucose excursion was significantly reduced by single oral administration of DA-1241 in wild-type mice but not in GPR119 knockout mice. GLP-1 secretion was increased by DA-1241 treatment in mice. Thus, upon combined sitagliptin and DA-1241 treatment in high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced diabetic mice, plasma active GLP-1 levels were synergistically increased. Accordingly, blood glucose and triglyceride levels were significantly lowered both by DA-1241 and sitagliptin alone and in combination. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that β-cell mass with reduced PDX1 levels in the islets from HFD/STZ diabetic mice was significantly preserved by DA-1241, whereas increased glucagon and BiP levels were significantly suppressed. In HIT-T15 insulinoma cells subjected to ER stress, decreased cell viability was significantly rescued by treatment with DA-1241. Additionally, increased apoptosis was largely attenuated by DA-1241 by inhibiting BiP and CHOP expression through suppression of p38 MAPK. In conclusion, these studies provide evidence that DA-1241 can be a promising antidiabetic drug by potentially preserving pancreatic functions through suppressing ER stress and increasing PDX1 expression.",2021-10-19
34678220,A novel stilbene derivative (GMQ3) suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in lung cancer via the p38-MAPK/SIRT1 pathway.,"Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The anticancer effect of stilbene has been noted in various tumor types. GMQ3, which has a stilbene-mimicking skeleton, is a novel small-molecule compound with promising antitumor activity. Our results revealed that GMQ3 not only suppressed cell proliferation and cell migration of lung cancer cells but also led to G1 phase cell cycle arrest and triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, investigation of the molecular mechanism showed that GMQ3 could inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis via the p38-MAPK/SIRT1 pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Xenograft tumor mouse models showed that GMQ3 significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo without affecting body weight. Our findings indicated that GMQ3 exerts a strong anticancer action by suppressing cell proliferation, inhibiting cell migration and inducing cell apoptosis. Moreover, the efficacy of GMQ3 was enhanced in the presence of CDK4/6 inhibitor Abemaciclib. We conclude that GMQ3 is a promising agent with potential for lung cancer.",2021-10-19
34674294,"Design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel (E)-N'-(3-allyl-2-hydroxy)benzylidene-2-(4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)acetohydrazides as antitumor agents.","In our continuing search for novel small-molecule anticancer agents, we designed and synthesized a series of novel (E)-N'-(3-allyl-2-hydroxy)benzylidene-2-(4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)acetohydrazides (5), focusing on the modification of substitution in the quinazolin-4(3H)-one moiety. The biological evaluation showed that all 13 designed and synthesized compounds displayed significant cytotoxicity against three human cancer cell lines (SW620, colon cancer; PC-3, prostate cancer; NCI-H23, lung cancer). The most potent compound 5l displayed cytotoxicity up to 213-fold more potent than 5-fluorouracil and 87-fold more potent than PAC-1, the first procaspase-activating compound. Structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that substitution of either electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing groups at positions 6 or 7 on the quinazolin-4(3H)-4-one moiety increased the cytotoxicity of the compounds, but substitution at position 6 seemed to be more favorable. In the caspase activation assay, compound 5l was found to activate the caspase activity by 291% in comparison to PAC-1, which was used as a control. Further docking simulation also revealed that this compound may be a potent allosteric inhibitor of procaspase-3 through chelation of the inhibitory zinc ion. Physicochemical and ADMET calculations for 5l provided useful information of its suitable absorption profile and some toxicological effects that need further optimization to be developed as a promising anticancer agent.",2021-10-21
34671742,Small molecule-mediated induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in cancer cells.,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is one of the crucial sub-cellular organelles controlling myriads of functions including protein biosynthesis, folding, misfolding and unfolding. As a result, dysregulation of these pathways in the ER is implicated in cancer development and progression. Subsequently, targeting the ER in cancer cells emerged as an interesting unorthodox strategy in next-generation anticancer therapy. However, development of small molecules to selectively target the ER for cancer therapy remained elusive and unexplored. To address this, herein, we have developed a novel small molecule library of sulfonylhydrazide-hydrazones through a short and concise chemical synthetic strategy. We identified a fluorescent small molecule that localized into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of HeLa cells, induced ER stress followed by triggering autophagy which was subsequently inhibited by chloroquine (autophagy inhibitor) to initiate apoptosis. This small molecule showed remarkable cancer cell killing efficacy in different cancer cells as mono and combination therapy with chloroquine, thus opening a new direction to illuminate ER-biology towards the development of novel anticancer therapeutics.",2021-07-15
34669461,High-Throughput Screening Identifies Inhibitors for Parvovirus B19 Infection of Human Erythroid Progenitors.,"Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection can cause hematological disorders and fetal hydrops during pregnancy. Currently, no antivirals or vaccines are available for the treatment or prevention of B19V infection. To identify novel small-molecule antivirals against B19V replication, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay, which is based on an <i>in vitro</i> nicking assay using recombinant N-terminal amino acids 1 to 176 of the viral large nonstructural protein (NS1N) and a fluorescently labeled DNA probe (<i>OriQ</i>) that spans the nicking site of the viral DNA replication origin. We collectively screened 17,040 compounds and identified 2,178 (12.78%) hits that possess >10% inhibition of the NS1 nicking activity, among which 84 hits were confirmed to inhibit nicking in a dose-dependent manner. Using <i>ex vivo</i>-expanded primary human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) infected by B19V, we validated 24 compounds that demonstrated >50% <i>in vivo</i> inhibition of B19V infection at 10 μM, which can be categorized into 7 structure scaffolds. Based on the therapeutic index (half-maximal cytotoxic concentration [CC<sub>50</sub>]/half-maximal effective concentration [EC<sub>50</sub>] ratio) in EPCs, the top 4 compounds were chosen to examine their inhibitions of B19V infection in EPCs at two times of the 90% maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>90</sub>). A purine derivative (P7) demonstrated an antiviral effect (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.46 μM) without prominent cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> = 71.8 μM) in EPCs and exhibited 92% inhibition of B19V infection in EPCs at 3.32 μM, which can be used as the lead compound in future studies for the treatment of B19V infection-caused hematological disorders. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> B19V encodes a large nonstructural protein, NS1. Its N-terminal domain (NS1N) consisting of amino acids 1 to 176 binds to viral DNA and serves as an endonuclease to nick the viral DNA replication origins, which is a pivotal step in rolling-hairpin-dependent B19V DNA replication. For high-throughput screening (HTS) of anti-B19V antivirals, we miniaturized a fluorescence-based <i>in vitro</i> nicking assay, which employs a fluorophore-labeled probe spanning the terminal resolution site (<i>trs</i>) and the NS1N protein, into a 384-well-plate format. The HTS assay showed high reliability and capability in screening 17,040 compounds. Based on the therapeutic index (half-maximal cytotoxic concentration [CC<sub>50</sub>]/half-maximal effective concentration [EC<sub>50</sub>] ratio) in EPCs, a purine derivative demonstrated an antiviral effect of 92% inhibition of B19V infection in EPCs at 3.32 μM (two times the EC<sub>90</sub>). Our study demonstrated a robust HTS assay for screening antivirals against B19V infection.",2021-10-20
34659885,"Cyy260, a novel small molecule inhibitor, suppresses non-small cell lung cancer cell growth via JAK2/STAT3 pathway.","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a malignant tumor that accounts for the most new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths worldwide, and the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC are the main reasons for treatment failure and patient death. Traditional chemotherapeutic drugs have low selectivity, which can kill cancer cells and cause damage to normal cells at the same time. Therefore, it is particularly important to study therapies that target cancer cells and to find low-toxicity, high-efficiency anticancer drugs. Cyy260 is a novel small molecule inhibitor that we synthesized for the first time. Here, we investigated the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> antitumor activities of Cyy260 and explored the underlying mechanisms in NSCLC. Cyy260 had a concentration- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on NSCLC cells, but it was less toxic to normal cells. Cyy260 regulated apoptosis through intracellular and extracellular apoptotic pathways. In addition, Cyy260 could also induce cell cycle arrest, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. Further analysis of molecular mechanisms showed that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was involved in the antitumor effect mediated by Cyy260. Analysis of subcutaneously transplanted tumors in mice showed that Cyy260 suppressed tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Our results proved that Cyy260 is a novel inhibitor of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway thus may have potential in therapy of NSCLC and other cancers.",2021-09-15
34652916,OAB-14 Effectively Ameliorates the Dysfunction of the Endosomal-Autophagic-Lysosomal Pathway in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), damaged Aβ clearance contributes to elevated levels of Aβ that cause a series of cytotoxic cascade reactions. Thus, targeting Aβ clearance has now been considered a valid therapeutic approach for AD. Cellular uptake and degradation are important mechanisms for Aβ clearance, which are mainly performed by the endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal (EAL) pathway. Our previous study showed that OAB-14, a novel small molecule designed with bexarotene as the lead compound, treatment for 3 months significantly alleviated cognitive disorders and remarkably reduced the deposition of Aβ without affecting its production in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Here, we further revealed that enhancement of the EAL activity is one of the mechanisms that increases Aβ clearance after OAB-14 administration for 3 months. OAB-14 facilitates receptor-mediated endocytosis and restores autophagy flux via the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Meanwhile, OAB-14 enhances the lysosomal activity, and reduced Aβ accumulation in lysosomes was observed in OAB-14-treated AD mice. These results suggest that OAB-14 may promote Aβ clearance in lysosomes by alleviating the EAL dysfunction in AD mice.",2021-10-15
34649152,HDAC/MIF dual inhibitor inhibits NSCLC cell survival and proliferation by blocking the AKT pathway.,"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is one of the most common forms of lung cancer, and a leading cause of cancer death among human beings. There is an urgent demand for novel therapeutics for the treatment of NSCLC to enhance the efficacy of the currently applied Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy and to overcome therapy-resistance. Here, we report a novel small-molecule inhibitor that simultaneously targets histone deacetylase (HDAC) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). The HDAC/MIF dual inhibitor proved to be toxic for EGFR mutated (H1650, TKI-resistant) or knock out (A549 EGFR<sup>-/-</sup>) NSCLC cell lines. Further experiments showed that HDAC inhibition inhibits cell survival and proliferation, while MIF inhibition downregulates pAKT or AKT expression level, which both interfere with cell survival. Furthermore, the combination treatment of TKI and HDAC/MIF dual inhibitor showed that the dual inhibitor enhanced TKI inhibitory efficacy, highlighting the advantages of HDAC/MIF dual inhibitor for more effective treatment of NSCLC.",2021-10-04
34638255,Imaging-Guided Evaluation of the Novel Small-Molecule Benzosuberene Tubulin-Binding Agent KGP265 as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Cancer Treatment.,"The selective disruption of tumor-associated vasculature represents an attractive therapeutic approach. We have undertaken the first in vivo evaluation of KGP265, a water-soluble prodrug of a benzosuberene-based tubulin-binding agent, and found promising vascular-disrupting activity in three distinct tumor types. Dose escalation in orthotopic MDA-MB-231-luc breast tumor xenografts in mice indicated that higher doses produced more effective vascular shutdown, as revealed by dynamic bioluminescence imaging (BLI). In syngeneic orthotopic 4T1-luc breast and RENCA-luc kidney tumors, dynamic BLI and oxygen enhanced multispectral optoacoustic tomography (OE-MSOT) were used to compare vascular shutdown following the administration of KGP265 (7.5 mg/kg). The BLI signal and vascular oxygenation response (ΔsO<sub>2</sub>) to a gas breathing challenge were both significantly reduced within 2 h, indicating vascular disruption, which continued over 24 h. A correlative histology confirmed increased necrosis and hemorrhage. Twice-weekly doses of KGP265 caused significant growth delay in both MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 breast tumors, with no obvious systemic toxicity. A combination with carboplatin produced significantly greater tumor growth delay than carboplatin alone, though significant carboplatin-associated toxicity was observed (whole-body weight loss). KGP265 was found to be effective at low concentrations, generating long-term vascular shutdown and tumor growth delay, thus providing strong rationale for further development, particularly in combination therapies.",2021-09-24

34606990,TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis of the effects of novel antimicrobial peptide AMP-17 against Candida albicans.,"Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. With the emergence of clinical fungal resistance, there is an urgent need to develop novel antifungal agents. AMP-17, a novel antimicrobial peptide from Musca domestica, has an antifungal effect against C. albicans, but its mechanism of antifungal action remains unclear. In the current study, we performed a proteomics analysis in C. albicans using TMT technique under the treatment of AMP-17. A total of 3931 proteins were identified, of which 3600 included quantitative information. With a 1.5-fold change threshold and a t-test p-value < 0.05 as standard, 423 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were up-regulated and 180 DEPs were down-regulated in the AMP-17/control. Notably, GO enrichment revealed that DEPs associated with the cell wall, RNA and oxidative stress were significantly up-regulated, while DEPs involved in ergosterol metabolism and membrane were significantly down-regulated in the AMP-17/control. KEGG pathway enrichment revealed that DEPs involved seven significant metabolic pathways, mainly involved oxidative phosphorylation, RNA degradation, propanoate metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. These results show that AMP-17 induces a complex organism response in C. albicans, indicating that AMP-17 may inhibit growth by affecting multiple targets in C. albicans cells. SIGNIFICANCE: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an important part of the innate immune system of organisms and having broad range of activity against fungi, bacteria and viruses. These AMPs are considered as probable candidate for forthcoming drugs, due to their broad range of activity, lesser toxicity and decreased resistance development by target cells. AMP-17, a novel antimicrobial peptide from M. domestica, has significant antifungal activity against C. albicans. It has been confirmed that AMP-17 can play an antifungal effect by destroying the cell wall and cell membrane of C. albicans in previous studies, but its mechanism of action at the protein level is currently unclear. In the current study, using the TMT-based quantitative proteomics method, 603 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the cells of C. albicans treated with AMP-17 for 12 h, and these DEPs were closely related to cell wall, cell membrane, RNA degradation and oxidative stress. The results provide new insights into the potential mechanism of action of AMP- 17 against C. albicans. Meanwhile, it provides certain technical support and theoretical basis for the research and development of novel peptide drugs.",2021-10-01
34606425,Identification of novel small molecule inhibitors for endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase 1α (ERO1α) enzyme: structure-based molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies.,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a cellular organelle responsible for the folding of proteins. When protein folding demand exceeds the folding capacity, cells trigger ER stress. ER-oxidoreductase 1α (ERO1α) is an ER stress component that controls oxidative folding protein. Upregulation of ERO1α was reported in distinct types of cancer including breast cancer and colon cancer. It was reported that deletion of ERO1 gene compromised cancer progression and cell proliferation in colon cancer. Thereby, ERO1α inhibition might be a clinically promising anti-cancer therapeutic target. In the present study, we conducted a virtual screening of 6,000 natural-product molecules obtained from Zinc database using a multistep docking approach with a crystal structure of human ERO1α. Our analyses from high throughput virtual screening revealed the top-ranked scores of 3000 molecules with glide scores of less than -4.0 kcal/mol. These molecules were further advanced to standard precision (SP) docking. The top 300 molecules of SP docking with glide scores ≤ -7.5 kcal/mol were chosen to undergo extra precision (XP) docking. Around 40 molecules that have conserved interactions with the binding site of ERO1α were ranked by the XP docking. Based on visual inspection, seven-candidate molecules that have high binding affinity scores and more molecular interactions were shortlisted. The dynamic stability of binding between the candidate molecules and ERO1α was characterized using 100 nanoseconds molecular dynamics simulation method. Two candidates exhibited strong and stable binding complexes with ERO1α. Collectively, these findings suggest that the identified molecules may serve as potential anti-cancer lead molecules subjected to further experimental validation. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",2021-10-04
34605595,Systematic Evaluation of Fluorination as Modification for Peptide-Based Fusion Inhibitors against HIV-1 Infection.,"With the emergence of novel viruses, the development of new antivirals is more urgent than ever. A key step in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is six-helix bundle formation within the envelope protein subunit gp41. Selective disruption of bundle formation by peptides has been shown to be effective; however, these drugs, exemplified by T20, are prone to rapid clearance from the patient. The incorporation of non-natural amino acids is known to improve these pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we evaluate a peptide inhibitor in which a critical Ile residue is replaced by fluorinated analogues. We characterized the influence of the fluorinated analogues on the biophysical properties of the peptide. Furthermore, we show that the fluorinated peptides can block HIV-1 infection of target cells at nanomolar levels. These findings demonstrate that fluorinated amino acids are appropriate tools for the development of novel peptide therapeutics.",2021-10-22
34585514,Prospects and Challenges of Developing Plant-Derived Snake Antivenin Natural Products: A Focus on West Africa.,"Snakebite envenomation (SBE) is an important public health issue that is now receiving renewed attention following its reclassification as a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD). Most incidences occur in rural areas of resource-limited countries, as such, timely and appropriate medical care for SBE is often inaccessible. The administration of anti-snake venom serum (ASV) is the only effective definitive treatment of SBE, but treatment failure to available ASVs is not uncommon. Emerging evidence highlights the potential of small-molecule compounds as inhibitors against toxins of snake venom. This presents an encouraging prospect to develop an alternative therapeutic option for the treatment SBE, that may be amenable for use at the point of care in resource-constraint settings. In view of the pivotal role of natural products in modern drug discovery programmes, there is considerable interest in ethno-pharmacological mining of medicinal plants and plant-derived medicinal compounds toward developing novel snake venom-neutralising therapeutics. In this review, we compile a collection of medicinal plants used in the treatment of SBE in West Africa and highlight their promise as potential botanical drugs or as sources of novel small-molecule compounds for the treatment of SBE. The challenges that must be surmounted to bring this to fruition including the need for (sub) regional collaboration have been discussed.",2021-10-19
34583982,"Discovery and Pharmacological Characterization of JNJ-64619178, a Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor of PRMT5 with Potent Antitumor Activity.","The protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) methylates a variety of proteins involved in splicing, multiple signal transduction pathways, epigenetic control of gene expression, and mechanisms leading to protein expression required for cellular proliferation. Dysregulation of PRMT5 is associated with clinical features of several cancers, including lymphomas, lung cancer, and breast cancer. Here, we describe the characterization of JNJ-64619178, a novel, selective, and potent PRMT5 inhibitor, currently in clinical trials for patients with advanced solid tumors, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. JNJ-64619178 demonstrated a prolonged inhibition of PRMT5 and potent antiproliferative activity in subsets of cancer cell lines derived from various histologies, including lung, breast, pancreatic, and hematological malignancies. In primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples, the presence of splicing factor mutations correlated with a higher <i>ex vivo</i> sensitivity to JNJ-64619178. Furthermore, the potent and unique mechanism of inhibition of JNJ-64619178, combined with highly optimized pharmacological properties, led to efficient tumor growth inhibition and regression in several xenograft models <i>in vivo</i>, with once-daily or intermittent oral-dosing schedules. An increase in splicing burden was observed upon JNJ-64619178 treatment. Overall, these observations support the continued clinical evaluation of JNJ-64619178 in patients with aberrant PRMT5 activity-driven tumors.",2021-09-28
34576691,Structure-Activity Relationship Studies on Novel Antiviral Agents for Norovirus Infections.,"Human norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, affecting every year 685 million people. Norovirus outbreaks are associated with very significant economic losses, with an estimated societal cost of 60 billion USD per year. Despite this, no therapeutic options or vaccines are currently available to treat or prevent this infection. An antiviral therapy that can be used as treatment and as a prophylactic measure in the case of outbreaks is urgently needed. We previously described the computer-aided design and synthesis of novel small-molecule agents able to inhibit the replication of human norovirus in cell-based systems. These compounds are non-nucleoside inhibitors of the viral polymerase and are characterized by a terminal <i>para</i>-substituted phenyl group connected to a central phenyl ring by an amide-thioamide linker, and a terminal thiophene ring. Here we describe new modifications of these scaffolds focused on exploring the role of the substituent at the <i>para</i> position of the terminal phenyl ring and on removing the thioamide portion of the amide-thioamide linker, to further explore structure-activity relationships (SARs) and improve antiviral properties. According to three to four-step synthetic routes, we prepared thirty novel compounds, which were then evaluated against the replication of both murine (MNV) and human (HuNoV) norovirus in cells. Derivatives in which the terminal phenyl group has been replaced by an unsubstituted benzoxazole or indole, and the thioamide component of the amide-thioamide linker has been removed, showed promising results in inhibiting HuNoV replication at low micromolar concentrations. Particularly, compound 28 was found to have an EC<sub>50</sub> against HuNoV of 0.9 µM. Although the most active novel derivatives were also associated with an increased cytotoxicity in the human cell line, these compounds represent a very promising starting point for the development of new analogues with reduced cytotoxicity and improved selectivity indexes. In addition, the experimental biological data have been used to create an initial 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship model, which could be used to guide the future design of novel potential anti-norovirus agents.",2021-08-24
34574082,AGL9: A Novel Hepatoprotective Peptide from the Larvae of Edible Insects Alleviates Obesity-Induced Hepatic Inflammation by Regulating AMPK/Nrf2 Signaling.,"In this study, we investigated the anti-obesity properties of the novel peptide Ala-Gly-Leu-Gln-Phe-Pro-Val-Gly-Arg (AGL9), isolated from the enzymatic hydrolysate of <i>Allomyrina</i><i>dichotoma</i> larvae. To investigate the preventive effects of AGL9 against hepatic steatosis and its possible mechanisms of action, we established an nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model by feeding C57BL/6 mice a high-fat diet. NAFLD mice were administered 100 mg/kg AGL9 and 60 mg/kg orlistat via gavage (10 mL/kg) for 5 weeks, followed by the collection of blood and liver tissues. We found that AGL9 normalized the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein (LDL)/LDL, adiponectin, and leptin in these mice. Additionally, AGL9 activated the protein-level expression of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation and the transcript-level expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glucocorticoid receptor, nuclear respiratory factor 2, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in hepatocytes. These results showed that AGL9 exhibited hepatoprotective effects by attenuating lipid deposition, oxidative stress, and inflammation via inhibition of AMPK/Nrf2 signaling, thereby reducing the production of hepatic proinflammatory mediators and indicating AGL9 as a potential therapeutic strategy for NAFLD.",2021-08-24
34573065,The Gasotransmitter Hydrogen Sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) Prevents Pathologic Calcification (PC) in Cartilage.,"Pathologic calcification (PC) is a painful and disabling condition whereby calcium-containing crystals deposit in tissues that do not physiologically calcify: cartilage, tendons, muscle, vessels and skin. In cartilage, compression and inflammation triggered by PC leads to cartilage degradation typical of osteoarthritis (OA). The PC process is poorly understood and treatments able to target the underlying mechanisms of the disease are lacking. Here we show a crucial role of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and, in particular, of the H<sub>2</sub>S-producing enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), in regulating PC in cartilage. Cse deficiency (Cse KO mice) exacerbated calcification in both surgically-induced (menisectomy) and spontaneous (aging) murine models of cartilage PC, and augmented PC was closely associated with cartilage degradation (OA). On the contrary, Cse overexpression (Cse tg mice) protected from these features. In vitro, Cse KO chondrocytes showed increased calcification, potentially via enhanced alkaline phosphatase (Alpl) expression and activity and increased IL-6 production. The opposite results were obtained in Cse tg chondrocytes. In cartilage samples from patients with OA, CSE expression inversely correlated with the degree of tissue calcification and disease severity. Increased cartilage degradation in murine and human tissues lacking or expressing low CSE levels may be accounted for by dysregulated catabolism. We found higher levels of matrix-degrading metalloproteases <i>Mmp-3</i> and <i>-13</i> in Cse KO chondrocytes, whereas the opposite results were obtained in Cse tg cells. Finally, by high-throughput screening, we identified a novel small molecule CSE positive allosteric modulator (PAM), and demonstrated that it was able to increase cellular H<sub>2</sub>S production, and decrease murine and human chondrocyte calcification and IL-6 secretion. Together, these data implicate impaired CSE-dependent H<sub>2</sub>S production by chondrocytes in the etiology of cartilage PC and worsening of secondary outcomes (OA). In this context, enhancing CSE expression and/or activity in chondrocytes could represent a potential strategy to inhibit PC.",2021-09-08
34572040,A Preclinical Investigation of GBM-N019 as a Potential Inhibitor of Glioblastoma via Exosomal mTOR/CDK6/STAT3 Signaling.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive brain malignancies with high incidences of developing treatment resistance, resulting in poor prognoses. Glioma stem cell (GSC)-derived exosomes are important players that contribute to GBM tumorigenesis and aggressive properties. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory roles of GBM-N019, a novel small molecule on the transfer of aggressive and invasive properties through the delivery of oncogene-loaded exosomes from GSCs to naïve and non-GSCs. Our results indicated that GBM-N019 significantly downregulated the expressions of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) signaling networks with concomitant inhibitory activities against viability, clonogenicity, and migratory abilities of U251 and U87MG cells. Treatments with GBM-N019 halted the exosomal transfer of protein kinase B (Akt), mTOR, p-mTOR, and Ras-related protein RAB27A to the naïve U251 and U87MG cells, and rescued the cells from invasive and stemness properties that were associated with activation of these oncogenes. GBM-N019 also synergized with and enhanced the anti-GBM activities of palbociclib in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our results suggested that GBM-N019 possesses good translational relevance as a potential anti-glioblastoma drug candidate worthy of consideration for clinical trials against recurrent glioblastomas.",2021-09-11
34566991,Nasal Immunization With Small Molecule Mast Cell Activators Enhance Immunity to Co-Administered Subunit Immunogens.,"Mast cell activators are a novel class of mucosal vaccine adjuvants. The polymeric compound, Compound 48/80 (C48/80), and cationic peptide, Mastoparan 7 (M7) are mast cell activators that provide adjuvant activity when administered by the nasal route. However, small molecule mast cell activators may be a more cost-efficient adjuvant alternative that is easily synthesized with high purity compared to M7 or C48/80. To identify novel mast cell activating compounds that could be evaluated for mucosal vaccine adjuvant activity, we employed high-throughput screening to assess over 55,000 small molecules for mast cell degranulation activity. Fifteen mast cell activating compounds were down-selected to five compounds based on <i>in vitro</i> immune activation activities including cytokine production and cellular cytotoxicity, synthesis feasibility, and selection for functional diversity. These small molecule mast cell activators were evaluated for <i>in vivo</i> adjuvant activity and induction of protective immunity against West Nile Virus infection in BALB/c mice when combined with West Nile Virus envelope domain III (EDIII) protein in a nasal vaccine. We found that three of the five mast cell activators, ST101036, ST048871, and R529877, evoked high levels of EDIII-specific antibody and conferred comparable levels of protection against WNV challenge. The level of protection provided by these small molecule mast cell activators was comparable to the protection evoked by M7 (67%) but markedly higher than the levels seen with mice immunized with EDIII alone (no adjuvant 33%). Thus, novel small molecule mast cell activators identified by high throughput screening are as efficacious as previously described mast cell activators when used as nasal vaccine adjuvants and represent next-generation mast cell activators for evaluation in mucosal vaccine studies.",2021-09-10
34564615,"Modification Strategy of D-leucine Residue Addition on a Novel Peptide from <i>Odorrana schmackeri</i>, with Enhanced Bioactivity and In Vivo Efficacy.","Brevinins are a well-characterised, frog-skin-derived, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) family, but their applications are limited by high cytotoxicity. In this study, a wild-type des-Leu2 brevinin peptide, named brevinin-1OS (B1OS), was identified from <i>Odorrana schmackeri</i>. To explore the significant role of the leucine residue at the second position, two variants, B1OS-L and B1OS-D-L, were designed by adding L-leucine and D-leucine residues at this site, respectively. The antibacterial and anticancer activities of B1OS-L and B1OS-D-L were around ten times stronger than the parent peptide. The activity of B1OS against the growth of Gram-positive bacteria was markedly enhanced after modification. Moreover, the leucine-modified products exerted in vivo therapeutic potential in an methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA)-infected waxworm model. Notably, the single substitution of D-leucine significantly increased the killing speed on lung cancer cells, where no viable H838 cells survived after 2 h of treatment with B1OS-D-L at 10 μM with low cytotoxicity on normal cells. Overall, our study suggested that the conserved leucine residue at the second position from the N-terminus is vital for optimising the dual antibacterial and anticancer activities of B1OS and proposed B1OS-D-L as an appealing therapeutic candidate for development.",2021-08-31
34564614,"BmK86-P1, a New Degradation Peptide with Desirable Thermostability and Kv1.2 Channel-Specific Activity from Traditional Chinese Scorpion Medicinal Material.","Thermally processed <i>Buthus martensii</i> Karsch scorpions are a traditional Chinese medical material for treating various diseases. However, their pharmacological foundation remains unclear. Here, a new degraded peptide of scorpion toxin was identified in Chinese scorpion medicinal material by proteomics. It was named BmK86-P1 and has six conserved cysteine residues. Homology modeling and circular dichroism spectra experiments revealed that BmK86-P1 not only contained representative disulfide bond-stabilized α-helical and β-sheet motifs but also showed remarkable stability at test temperatures from 20-95 °C. Electrophysiology experiments indicated that BmK86-P1 was a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the hKv1.2 channel with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 28.5 ± 6.3 nM. Structural and functional dissection revealed that two residues of BmK86-P1 (i.e., Lys<sup>19</sup> and Ile<sup>21</sup>) were the key residues that interacted with the hKv1.2 channel. In addition, channel chimeras and mutagenesis experiments revealed that three amino acids (i.e., Gln<sup>357</sup>, Val<sup>381</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup>) of the hKv1.2 channel were responsible for BmK86-P1 selectivity. This research uncovered a new bioactive peptide from traditional Chinese scorpion medicinal material that has desirable thermostability and Kv1.2 channel-specific activity, which strongly suggests that thermally processed scorpions are novel peptide resources for new drug discovery for the Kv1.2 channel-related ataxia and epilepsy diseases.",2021-08-30
34554500,"The Kv1.3 K<sup>+</sup> channel in the immune system and its ""precision pharmacology"" using peptide toxins.","Since the discovery of the Kv1.3 voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel in human T cells in 1984, ion channels are considered crucial elements of the signal transduction machinery in the immune system. Our knowledge about Kv1.3 and its inhibitors is outstanding, motivated by their potential application in autoimmune diseases mediated by Kv1.3 overexpressing effector memory T cells (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis). High affinity Kv1.3 inhibitors are either small organic molecules (e.g., Pap-1) or peptides isolated from venomous animals. To date, the highest affinity Kv1.3 inhibitors with the best Kv1.3 selectivity are the engineered analogues of the sea anemone peptide ShK (e.g., ShK-186), the engineered scorpion toxin HsTx1[R14A] and the natural scorpion toxin Vm24. These peptides inhibit Kv1.3 in picomolar concentrations and are several thousand-fold selective for Kv1.3 over other biologically critical ion channels. Despite the significant progress in the field of Kv1.3 molecular pharmacology several progressive questions remain to be elucidated and discussed here. These include the conjugation of the peptides to carriers to increase the residency time of the peptides in the circulation (e.g., PEGylation and engineering the peptides into antibodies), use of rational drug design to create novel peptide inhibitors and understanding the potential off-target effects of Kv1.3 inhibition.",2021-02-06
34553597,Discovery of Novel Small Molecule Inhibitors Disrupting the PCSK9-LDLR Interaction.,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) has been identified as a reliable therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery heart diseases since the monoclonal antibodies of PCSK9 have launched. Disrupting the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between PCSK9 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) has been considered as a promising approach for developing PCSK9 inhibitors. However, PPIs have been traditionally considered difficult to target by small molecules since the PPI surface is usually large, flat, featureless, and without a ""pocket"" or ""groove"" for ligand binding. The PCSK9-LDLR PPI interface is such a typical case. In this study, a potential binding pocket was generated on the PCSK9-LDLR PPI surface of PCSK9 through induced-fit docking. On the basis of this induced binding pocket, virtual screening, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and biological evaluations have been applied for the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors of PCSK9-LDLR PPI. Among the selected compounds, compound <b>13</b> exhibited certain PCSK9-LDLR PPI inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub>: 7.57 ± 1.40 μM). The direct binding affinity between <b>13</b> and PCSK9 was determined with a <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> value of 2.50 ± 0.73 μM. The LDLR uptake function could be also restored to a certain extent by <b>13</b> in HepG2 cells. This well-characterized hit compound will facilitate the further development of novel small molecule inhibitors of PCSK9-LDLR PPI.",2021-09-23
34522208,Smart magnetic resonance imaging-based theranostics for cancer.,"Smart theranostics are dynamic platforms that integrate multiple functions, including at least imaging, therapy, and responsiveness, in a single agent. This review showcases a variety of responsive theranostic agents developed specifically for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), due to the privileged position this non-invasive, non-ionising imaging modality continues to hold within the clinical imaging field. Different MRI smart theranostic designs have been devised in the search for more efficient cancer therapy, and improved diagnostic efficiency, through the increase of the local concentration of therapeutic effectors and MRI signal intensity in pathological tissues. This review explores novel small-molecule and nanosized MRI theranostic agents for cancer that exhibit responsiveness to endogenous (change in pH, redox environment, or enzymes) or exogenous (temperature, ultrasound, or light) stimuli.

34516580,Effective inhibition of Clostridioides difficile by the novel peptide CM-A.,"Clostridioides difficile infection is the most common cause of nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. C. difficile treatment is increasingly likely to fail, and the recurrence rate is high. Antimicrobial peptides are considered an alternative treatment for many infectious diseases, including those caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. In the present study, we identified a CM peptide, a hybrid of cecropin A and melittin, and its derivative which possesses potent antimicrobial activity against C. difficile strain 630. CM peptide exhibited antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration of 3.906 μg/ml (2.21 μM). A modified derivative of CM, CM-A, exhibited even greater activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.953 μg/ml (1.06 μM) and a minimum bactericidal concentration of 7.8125 μg/ml (4.24 μM), which indicates that CM-A peptide is more efficient than its parent peptide. A fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that the membrane of C. difficile 630 could be an important target for CM-A. This peptide induced high levels of cell depolarization and cell permeability on C. difficile cell membrane. Moreover, electron microscopy imaging showed that CM-A interferes with the C. difficile cell membrane. Hence, the antimicrobial peptide CM-A may represent a promising novel approach for the treatment of C. difficile infections.",2021-09-13
34512368,Targeting Autophagy with Natural Compounds in Cancer: A Renewed Perspective from Molecular Mechanisms to Targeted Therapy.,"Natural products are well-characterized to have pharmacological or biological activities that can be of therapeutic benefits for cancer therapy, which also provide an important source of inspiration for discovery of potential novel small-molecule drugs. In the past three decades, accumulating evidence has revealed that natural products can modulate a series of key autophagic signaling pathways and display therapeutic effects in different types of human cancers. In this review, we focus on summarizing some representative natural active compounds, mainly including curcumin, resveratrol, paclitaxel, Bufalin, and Ursolic acid that may ultimately trigger cancer cell death through the regulation of some key autophagic signaling pathways, such as RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, AMPK, ULK1, Beclin-1, Atg5 and p53. Taken together, these inspiring findings would shed light on exploiting more natural compounds as candidate small-molecule drugs, by targeting the crucial pathways of autophagy for the future cancer therapy.",2021-08-26
34509608,A novel glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor attenuates alpha synuclein pathology and lysosomal dysfunction in preclinical models of synucleinopathy.,"Mutations in the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase, GBA1 gene) are the most common genetic risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease (PD). GCase metabolizes the glycosphingolipids glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph). Mutations in GBA1 reduce enzyme activity and the resulting accumulation of glycosphingolipids may contribute to the underlying pathology of PD, possibly via altering lysosomal function. While reduction of GCase activity exacerbates α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation, it has not been determined that this effect is the result of altered glycosphingolipid levels and lysosome function or some other effect of altering GCase. The glycosphingolipid GlcCer is synthesized by a single enzyme, glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), and small molecule inhibitors (GCSi) reduce cellular glycosphingolipid levels. In the present studies, we utilize a preformed fibril (PFF) rodent primary neuron in vitro model of α-syn pathology to investigate the relationship between glycosphingolipid levels, α-syn pathology, and lysosomal function. In primary cultures, pharmacological inhibition of GCase and D409V GBA1 mutation enhanced accumulation of glycosphingolipids and insoluble phosphorylated α-syn. Administration of a novel small molecule GCSi, benzoxazole 1 (BZ1), significantly decreased glycosphingolipid concentrations in rodent primary neurons and reduced α-syn pathology. BZ1 rescued lysosomal deficits associated with the D409V GBA1 mutation and α-syn PFF administration, and attenuated α-syn induced neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons. In vivo studies revealed BZ1 had pharmacological activity and reduced glycosphingolipids in the mouse brain to a similar extent observed in neuronal cultures. These data support the hypothesis that reduction of glycosphingolipids through GCS inhibition may impact progression of synucleinopathy and BZ1 is useful tool to further examine this important biology.",2021-09-09
34504668,Protein-gene Expression Nexus: Comprehensive characterization of human cancer cell lines with proteogenomic analysis.,"Researchers have gained new therapeutic insights using multi-omics platform approaches to study DNA, RNA, and proteins of comprehensively characterized human cancer cell lines. To improve our understanding of the molecular features associated with oncogenic modulation in cancer, we proposed a proteogenomic database for human cancer cell lines, called Protein-gene Expression Nexus (PEN). We have expanded the characterization of cancer cell lines to include genetic, mRNA, and protein data of 145 cancer cell lines from various public studies. PEN contains proteomic and phosphoproteomic data on 4,129,728 peptides, 13,862 proteins, 7,138 phosphorylation site-associated genomic variations, 117 studies, and 12 cancer. We analyzed functional characterizations along with the integrated datasets, such as cis/trans association for copy number alteration (CNA), single amino acid variation for coding genes, post-translation modification site variation for Single Amino Acid Variation, and novel peptide expression for noncoding regions and fusion genes. PEN provides a user-friendly interface for searching, browsing, and downloading data and also supports the visualization of genome-wide association between CNA and expression, novel peptide landscape, mRNA-protein abundance, and functional annotation. Together, this dataset and PEN data portal provide a resource to accelerate cancer research using model cancer cell lines. PEN is freely accessible at http://combio.snu.ac.kr/pen.",2021-08-17
34494384,Direct AMPK Activation Corrects NASH in Rodents Through Metabolic Effects and Direct Action on Inflammation and Fibrogenesis.,"No approved therapies are available for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central regulator of cell metabolism; its activation has been suggested as a therapeutic approach to NASH. Here we aimed to fully characterize the potential for direct AMPK activation in preclinical models and to determine mechanisms that could contribute to efficacy for this disease. A novel small-molecule direct AMPK activator, PXL770, was used. Enzyme activity was measured with recombinant complexes. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) was quantitated in vivo and in mouse and human primary hepatocytes. Metabolic efficacy was assessed in ob/ob and high-fat diet-fed mice. Liver histology, biochemical measures, and immune cell profiling were assessed in diet-induced NASH mice. Direct effects on inflammation and fibrogenesis were assessed using primary mouse and human hepatic stellate cells, mouse adipose tissue explants, and human immune cells. PXL770 directly activated AMPK in vitro and reduced DNL in primary hepatocytes. In rodent models with metabolic syndrome, PXL770 improved glycemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. In mice with NASH, PXL770 reduced hepatic steatosis, ballooning, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. PXL770 exhibited direct inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine production and activation of primary hepatic stellate cells. Conclusion: In rodent models, direct activation of AMPK is sufficient to produce improvements in all core components of NASH and to ameliorate related hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation. Novel properties of direct AMPK activation were also unveiled: improved insulin resistance and direct suppression of inflammation and fibrogenesis. Given effects also documented in human cells (reduced DNL, suppression of inflammation and stellate cell activation), these studies support the potential for direct AMPK activation to effectively treat patients with NASH.",2021-09-07
34481973,A novel small-molecule antagonist enhances the sensitivity of osteosarcoma to cabozantinib in vitro and in vivo by targeting DNMT-1 correlated with disease severity in human patients.,"Advanced osteosarcoma (OSA) is highly aggressive and can lead to distant metastasis or recurrence. Here, a novel small-molecule inhibitor/antagonist of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT-1) named DI-1 (inhibitor of DNMT-1) was explored to enhance the antitumor effect of a molecular-targeted agent, cabozantinib, on OSA cell lines. In patients with OSA, expression of DNMT-1 was negatively related with that of microRNA (miR)-34a and associated with a poor prognosis. In OSA cell lines (OSA cell line U2OS and an OSA cell line U2OS<sup>R</sup> resistance to cabozantinib), DI-1 treatment enhanced miR-34a expression by inhibiting hypermethylation of the promoter region of miR-34a mediated by DNMT-1. DI-1 enhanced the sensitivity of OSA cells (U2OS, 143B and MG63) to cabozantinib and other molecular-targeted agents by enhancing miR-34a expression and repressing activation of the Notch pathway. Mechanistically, DI-1 repressed recruitment of DNMT-1 to the promoter region of miR-34a and, in turn, decreased the methylation rate in the promoter region of miR-34a in OSA cells. These results suggest that repressing DNMT-1 activation by DI-1 enhances miR-34a expression in OSA cells and could be a promising therapeutic strategy for OSA.",2021-09-03
34468186,Novel Small Molecule Growth Inhibitor Affecting Bacterial Outer Membrane Reduces Extraintestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) Infection in Avian Model.,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), a subgroup of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), causes colibacillosis in chickens and is reportedly implicated in urinary tract infections and meningitis in humans. A major limitation for the current ExPEC antibiotic therapy is the development of resistance, and antibacterial drugs that can circumvent this problem are critically needed. Here, we evaluated eight novel membrane-affecting anti-APEC small molecule growth inhibitors (GIs), identified in our previous study, against APEC infection in chickens. Among the GIs tested, GI-7 (the most effective), when administered orally (1 mg/kg of body weight), reduced the mortality (41.7%), severity of lesions (62.9%), and APEC load (2.6 log) in chickens. Furthermore, GI-7 administration at an optimized dose (60 mg/liter) in drinking water also reduced the mortality (14.7%), severity of lesions (29.5%), and APEC load (2.2 log) in chickens. The abundances of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and oleate were increased in the cecum and serum, respectively, of GI-7-treated chickens. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that GI-7 was readily absorbed with minimal accumulation in the tissues. Earlier, we showed that GI-7 induced membrane blebbing and increased membrane permeability in APEC, suggesting an effect on the APEC membrane. Consistent with this finding, the expression of genes essential for maintaining outer membrane (OM) integrity was downregulated in GI-7-treated APEC. Furthermore, decreased levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transport (Lpt) proteins and LPS were observed in GI-7-treated APEC. However, the mechanism of action of GI-7 currently remains unknown and needs further investigation. Our studies suggest that GI-7 represents a promising novel lead compound that can be developed to treat APEC infection in chickens and related human ExPEC infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> APEC is a subgroup of ExPEC, and genetic similarities of APEC with human ExPECs, including uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and neonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC), have been reported. Our study identified a novel small molecule growth inhibitor, GI-7, effective in reducing APEC infection in chickens with an efficacy similar to that of the currently used antibiotic sulfadimethoxine, notably with an 8-times-lower dose. GI-7 affects the OM integrity and decreases the Lpt protein and LPS levels in APEC, an antibacterial mechanism that can overcome the antibiotic resistance problem. Overall, GI-7 represents a promising lead molecule/scaffold for the development of novel antibacterial therapies that could have profound implications for treating APEC infections in chickens, as well as human infections caused by ExPECs and other related Gram-negative bacteria. Further elucidation of the mechanism of action of GI-7 and identification of its target(s) in APEC will benefit future novel antibacterial development efforts.",2021-09-01
34458757,Harnessing cyclotides to design and develop novel peptide GPCR ligands.,"Cyclotides are plant-derived cyclic, disulfide-rich peptides with a unique cyclic cystine knot topology that confers them with remarkable structural stability and resistance to proteolytic degradation. Recently, cyclotides have emerged as promising scaffold molecules for designing peptide-based therapeutics. Here, we provide examples of how engineering cyclotides using molecular grafting may lead to the development of novel peptide ligands of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), today's most exploited drug targets. Integrating bioactive epitopes into stable cyclotide scaffolds can lead to improved pharmacokinetics and oral activity as well as selectivity and high enzymatic stability. We also discuss and highlight the importance of engineered cyclotides as novel tools to study GPCR signaling.",2020-07-22
34450253,circ-EIF6 encodes EIF6-224aa to promote TNBC progression via stabilizing MYH9 and activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.,"The protein-coding ability of circular RNAs (circRNAs) has recently been a hot topic, but the expression and roles of protein-coding circRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain uncertain. By intersecting circRNA sequencing data from clinical samples and cell lines, we identified a circRNA, termed circ-EIF6, which predicted a poorer prognosis and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics in a cohort of TNBC patients. Functionally, we showed that circ-EIF6 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that circ-EIF6 contains a 675-nucleotide (nt) open reading frame (ORF) and that the -150-bp sequence from ATG functioned as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which is required for translation initiation in 5' cap-independent coding RNAs. circ-EIF6 encodes a novel peptide, termed EIF6-224 amino acid (aa), which is responsible for the oncogenic effects of circ-EIF6. The endogenous expression of EIF6-224aa was further examined in TNBC cells and tissues by specific antibody. Moreover, EIF6-224aa directly interacted with MYH9, an oncogene in breast cancer, and decreased MYH9 degradation by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and subsequently activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Our study provided novel insights into the roles of protein-coding circRNAs and supported circ-EIF6/EIF6-224aa as a novel promising prognostic and therapeutic target for tailored therapy in TNBC patients.",2021-08-25
34443195,Development and Characterization of High Efficacy Cell-Penetrating Peptide via Modulation of the Histidine and Arginine Ratio for Gene Therapy.,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), as non-viral gene delivery vectors, are considered with lower immunogenic response, and safer and higher gene capacity than viral systems. In our previous study, a CPP peptide called RALA (arginine rich) presented desirable transfection efficacy and owns a potential clinic use. It is believed that histidine could enhance the endosome escaping ability of CPPs, yet RALA peptide contains only one histidine in each chain. In order to develop novel superior CPPs, by using RALA as a model, we designed a series of peptides named HALA (increased histidine ratio). Both plasmid DNA (pDNA) and siRNA transfection results on three cell lines revealed that the transfection efficacy is better when histidine replacements were on the C-terminal instead of on the N-terminal, and two histidine replacements are superior to three. By investigating the mechanism of endocytosis of the pDNA nanocomplexes, we discovered that there were multiple pathways that led to the process and caveolae played the main role. During the screening, we discovered a novel peptide-HALA2 of high cellular transfection efficacy, which may act as an exciting gene delivery vector for gene therapy. Our findings also bring new insights on the development of novel robust CPPs.",2021-08-19
34440739,Comprehensive Omics Analysis of a Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor of Chemoresistant Oncogenic Signatures in Colorectal Cancer Cell with Antitumor Effects.,"Tumor recurrence from cancer stem cells (CSCs) and metastasis often occur post-treatment in colorectal cancer (CRC), leading to chemoresistance and resistance to targeted therapy. <i>MYC</i> is a transcription factor in the nuclei that modulates cell growth and development, and regulates immune response in an antitumor direction by mediating programmed death ligand 1 (<i>PD-L1</i>) and promoting CRC tumor recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the molecular mechanism through which <i>c-MYC</i> maintains stemness and confers treatment resistance still remains elusive in CRC. In addition, recent reports demonstrated that CRC solid colon tumors expresses C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (<i>CXCL8</i>). Expression of <i>CXCL8</i> in CRC was reported to activate the expression of PD-L1 immune checkpoint through c-MYC, this ultimately induces chemoresistance in CRC. Accumulating studies have also demonstrated increased expression of <i>CXCL8</i>, matrix metalloproteinase 7 (<i>MMP7</i>), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (<i>TIMP1</i>), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (<i>EMT</i>) components, in CRC tumors suggesting their potential collaboration to promote <i>EMT</i> and CSCs. <i>TIMP1</i> is <i>MMP</i>-independent and regulates cell development and apoptosis in various cancer cell types, including CRC. Recent studies showed that <i>TIMP1</i> cleaves <i>CXCL8</i> on its chemoattractant, thereby influencing its mechanistic response to therapy. This therefore suggests crosstalk among the <i>c-MYC</i>/<i>CXCL8</i>/<i>TIMP1</i> oncogenic signatures. In this study, we explored computer simulations through bioinformatics to identify and validate that the <i>MYC</i>/<i>CXCL8</i>/<i>TIMP1</i> oncogenic signatures are overexpressed in CRC, Moreover, our docking results exhibited putative binding affinities of the above-mentioned oncogenes, with our novel small molecule, RV59, Finally, we demonstrated the anticancer activities of RV59 against NCI human CRC cancer cell lines both as single-dose and dose-dependent treatments, and also demonstrated the <i>MYC</i>/<i>CXCL8</i>/<i>TIMP1</i> signaling pathway as a potential RV59 drug target.",2021-08-03
34440055,Development and Characterization of a Novel Peptide-Drug Conjugate with DM1 for Treatment of FGFR2-Positive Tumors.,"A maytansin derivative, DM1, is a promising therapeutic compound for treating tumors, but is also a highly poisonous substance with various side effects. For clinical expansion, we tried to develop novel peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) with DM1. In the study, a one-bead one-compound (OBOC) platform was used to screen and identify a novel, highly stable, non-natural amino acid peptide targeting the tyrosine receptor FGFR2. Then, the identified peptide, named LLC2B, was conjugated with the cytotoxin DM1. Our results show that LLC2B has high affinity for the FGFR2 protein according to an isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) test. LLC2B-Cy5.5 binding to FGFR2-positive cancer cells was confirmed by fluorescent microscopic imaging and flow cytometry in vitro. Using xenografted nude mouse models established with breast cancer MCF-7 cells and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma KYSE180 cells, respectively, LLC2B-Cy5.5 was observed to specifically target tumor tissues 24 h after tail vein injection. Incubation assays, both in aqueous solution at room temperature and in human plasma at 37 °C, suggested that LLC2B has high stability and strong anti-proteolytic ability. Then, we used two different linkers, one of molecular disulfide bonds and another of a maleimide group, to couple LLC2B to the toxin DM1. The novel peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) inhibited tumor growth and significantly increased the maximum tolerated dose of DM1 in xenografted mice. In brief, our results suggest that LLC2B-DM1 can be developed into a potential PDC for tumor treatment in the future.",2021-07-21
34428447,"PCC-0105002, a novel small molecule inhibitor of PSD95-nNOS protein-protein interactions, attenuates neuropathic pain and corrects motor disorder associated with neuropathic pain model.","In view of postsynaptic density 95kDA (PSD95) tethers neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), the PSD95-nNOS complex represents a therapeutic target of neuropathic pain. This study therefore sought to explore the ability of PCC-0105002, a novel PSD95-nNOS small molecule inhibitor, to alter pain sensitivity in rodent neuropathic pain models. Firstly, the IC<sub>50</sub> of PCC-0105002 for PSD95 and NOS1 binding activity was determined using an Alpha Screen assay kit. Then, we examined the effects of PCC-0105002 in the mouse formalin test and in the rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model, and explored the ability of PCC-0105002 to mediate analgesia and to effect motor coordination in a rota-rod test. Moreover, the mechanisms whereby PCC-0105002 mediates analgesia was explored via western blotting, Golgi staining, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in dorsal horn. The outcomes indicated that PCC-0105002 exhibited dose-dependent attenuation of phase II pain-associated behaviors in the formalin test. The result indicated that PCC-0105002 disrupted the PSD95-nNOS interaction with IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.408 μM. In the SNL model, PCC-0105002 suppressed mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and abnormal dorsal horn wide dynamic range neuron discharge. PCC-0105002 mediated an analgesic effect comparable to that of MK-801, while it was better able to enhance motor coordination as compared with MK-801. Moreover, PCC-0105002 altered signaling downstream of NMDAR and thus functionally and structurally attenuating synaptic plasticity through respective regulation of the NR2B/GluR1/CaMKIIα and Rac1/RhoA pathways. These findings suggest that the novel PSD95-nNOS inhibitor PCC-0105002 is an effective agent for alleviating neuropathic pain, and that it produces fewer motor coordination-associated side effects than do NMDAR antagonists.",2021-08-21
34427763,Novel peptide (RATH) mediated delivery of peptide nucleic acids for antiviral interventions.,"The peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a chimeric molecule with the nucleobases connected by peptide bonds. This chimeric nature gives the PNA certain therapeutic advantages over natural antisense nucleic acid molecules. The PNA probes are known for its better and stronger complementation with target nucleic acids. However, cellular delivery of PNA is a major hurdle due to the charge-neutral nature of the PNA. For cellular delivery of PNA, peptide-PNA conjugates are used. This approach may face some practical limitation in terms of PNA antisense activity. In this study, we propose a novel RATH-2 peptide-based non-covalent PNA delivery mechanism. We observed RATH-2 shows a favorable molecular interaction with PNA at 16:1 (peptide:PNA) molar ratio resulting in co-centric nanoparticle formation. With this combination, we could achieve as high as 93% cellular delivery of the PNA. The proposed non-covalent RATH:PNA delivery model showed endocytic entrapment free delivery of PNA. The study further demonstrated the therapeutic application of PNA with in vitro antiviral intervention model. Using RATH-2 non-covalent PNA delivery system, we could inhibit 69.5% viral load. The present study demonstrates a cell-penetrating peptide:PNA interaction can lead to nanoparticle formations that facilitated cellular delivery of PNA.Key points• A novel cell-penetrating peptide (RATH-2) was identified for non-covalent delivery of PNA.• RATH-2 and PNA formed co-centric nanoparticles at appropriate molar combination.• PNA delivered through the RATH-2 inhibited the viral gene expression and reduced the viral load.",2021-08-24

BC-N102 treatment exhibits dose-dependent cytotoxic effects against ER+ breast cancer cell lines. BC-N102 exhibited time course- and dose-dependent cell cycle arrest via downregulation of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated (p)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-Akt, CDK2, and CDK4 while increasing p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling in breast cancer cell line. In addition, we found that BC-N102 suppressed breast cancer tumorigenesis in vivo and prolonged the survival of animals. Our results suggest that the proper application of BC-N102 may be a beneficial chemotherapeutic strategy for ER+ breast cancer patients.",2021-07-25
34411602,Inhibiting miR-129-5p alleviates inflammation and modulates autophagy by targeting ATG14 in fungal keratitis.,"To investigate the role of miR-129-5p in inflammation and autophagy in fungal keratitis, we established a keratitis mouse model infected with Fusarium solani (F. solani) and conducted experiments on corneal stromal cells infected with F. solani. The expression of miR-129-5p was detected via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The miR-129-5p antagomir was used to transfect cells and mice to study the regulatory role of miR-129-5p in autophagy and inflammation after fungal infection. The expression of Beclin1 and LC3B and colocalization of LC3B with lysosomes were detected via Western blotting and immunofluorescence. CCK-8 was used to determine the viability of corneal stromal cells. The expression of IL-1β were detected by ELISA. Bioinformatics software was used to predict the potential targets of miR-129-5p, which were verified by a luciferase reporter gene assay. RT-PCR showed that miR-129-5p expression in mouse corneas was significantly increased after infection with F. solani. Subconjunctival injection of the miR-129-5p antagomir significantly enhanced the proteins Beclin-1 and LC3B. At the same time, inhibiting miR-129-5p expression could reduce the inflammatory response in FK and significantly increase the viability of corneal stromal cells infected with F. solan. Moreover, the dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that Atg14 was a direct target of miR-129-5p. Our study shows that miR-129-5p is a novel small molecule that regulates autophagy by targeting Atg14, indicating that it may be a proinflammatory and therapeutic target for fungal keratitis.",2021-08-17
34403259,Discovery of Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease as Potential Leads for COVID-19 Treatment.,"The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 virus, M<sup>pro</sup>, is an essential element for viral replication, and inhibitors targeting M<sup>pro</sup> are currently being investigated in many drug development programs as a possible treatment for COVID-19. An <i>in vitro</i> pilot screen of a highly focused collection of compounds was initiated to identify new lead scaffolds for M<sup>pro</sup>. These efforts identified a number of hits. The most effective of these was compound SIMR-2418 having an inhibitory IC<sub>50</sub> value of 20.7 μM. Molecular modeling studies were performed to understand the binding characteristics of the identified compounds.

34389740,Potent antitumor activity of a glutamyltransferase-derived peptide via an activation of oncosis pathway.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still presents poor prognosis with high mortality rate, despite of the improvement in the management. The challenge for precision treatment was due to the fact that little targeted therapeutics are available for HCC. Recent studies show that metabolic and circulating peptides serve as endogenous switches for correcting aberrant cellular plasticity. Here we explored the antitumor activity of low molecular components in human umbilical serum and identified a high abundance peptide VI-13 by peptidome analysis, which was recognized as the part of glutamyltransferase signal peptide. We modified VI-13 by inserting four arginines and obtained an analog peptide VI-17 to improve its solubility. Our analyses showed that the peptide VI-17 induced rapid context-dependent cell death, and exhibited a higher sensitivity on hepatoma cells, which is attenuated by polyethylene glycol but not necrotic inhibitors such as z-VAD-fmk or necrostatin-1. Morphologically, VI-17 induced cell swelling, blebbing and membrane rupture with release of cellular ATP and LDH into extracellular media, which is hallmark of oncotic process. Mechanistically, VI-17 induced cell membrane pore formation, degradation of α-tubulin via influx of calcium ion. These results indicated that the novel peptide VI-17 induced oncosis in HCC cells, which could serve as a promising lead for development of therapeutic intervention of HCC.",2021-08-13
34381031,The enzymatic activity of inositol hexakisphosphate kinase controls circulating phosphate in mammals.,"Circulating phosphate levels are tightly controlled within a narrow range in mammals. By using a novel small-molecule inhibitor, we show that the enzymatic activity of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6K) is essential for phosphate regulation in vivo. IP6K inhibition suppressed XPR1, a phosphate exporter, thereby decreasing cellular phosphate export, which resulted in increased intracellular ATP levels. The in vivo inhibition of IP6K decreased plasma phosphate levels without inhibiting gut intake or kidney reuptake of phosphate, demonstrating a pivotal role of IP6K-regulated cellular phosphate export on circulating phosphate levels. IP6K inhibition-induced decrease in intracellular inositol pyrophosphate, an enzymatic product of IP6K, was correlated with phosphate changes. Chronic IP6K inhibition alleviated hyperphosphataemia, increased kidney ATP, and improved kidney functions in chronic kidney disease rats. Our results demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of IP6K regulates circulating phosphate and intracellular ATP and suggest that IP6K inhibition is a potential novel treatment strategy against hyperphosphataemia.",2021-08-11
34373735,Small-molecule inhibitor of AF9/ENL-DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 interactions suppresses malignant gene expression and tumor growth.,"Chromosome translocations involving mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene cause acute leukemia with a poor prognosis. MLL is frequently fused with transcription cofactors AF4 (~35%), AF9 (25%) or its paralog ENL (10%). The AHD domain of AF9/ENL binds to AF4, its paralog AFF4, or histone-H3 lysine-79 (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L. Formation of AF9/ENL/AF4/AFF4-containing super elongation complexes (SEC) and the catalytic activity of DOT1L are essential for MLL-rearranged leukemia. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) between AF9/ENL and DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 are therefore a potential drug target. <b>Methods</b>: Compound screening followed by medicinal chemistry was used to find inhibitors of such PPIs, which were examined for their biological activities against MLL-rearranged leukemia and other cancer cells. <b>Results</b>: Compound-<b>1</b> was identified to be a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the AF9/ENL-DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 interaction with IC50s of 0.9-3.5 µM. Pharmacological inhibition of the PPIs significantly reduced SEC and DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in the leukemia cells. Gene profiling shows compound-<b>1</b> significantly suppressed the gene signatures related to onco-MLL, DOT1L, HoxA9 and Myc. It selectively inhibited proliferation of onco-MLL- or Myc-driven cancer cells and induced cell differentiation and apoptosis. Compound-<b>1</b> exhibited strong antitumor activity in a mouse model of MLL-rearranged leukemia. <b>Conclusions:</b> The AF9/ENL-DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 interactions are validated to be an anticancer target and compound-<b>1</b> is a useful in vivo probe for biological studies as well as a pharmacological lead for further drug development.",2021-07-13

This study deals with the design and synthesis of new glycyrrhetinic acid (GA)-amino acid peptides and peptide ester derivatives. The structures of the new derivatives were established through various spectral and microanalytical data. The novel compounds were screened for their in vitro cytotoxic activity. The evaluation results showed that the new peptides produced promising cytotoxic activity against the human breast MCF-7 cancer cell line while comparing to doxorubicin. On the other hand, only compounds <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b> produced potent activity against human colon HCT-116 cancer cell line.

34361008,A Novel Peptide Derived from the Transmembrane Domain of Romo1 Is a Promising Candidate for Sepsis Treatment and Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria.,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria through the abuse and long-term use of antibiotics is a serious health problem worldwide. Therefore, novel antimicrobial agents that can cure an infection from MDR bacteria, especially gram-negative bacteria, are urgently needed. Antimicrobial peptides, part of the innate immunity system, have been studied to find bactericidal agents potent against MDR bacteria. However, they have many problems, such as restrained systemic activity and cytotoxicity. In a previous study, we suggested that the K58-R78 domain of Romo1, a mitochondrial protein encoded by the nucleus, was a promising treatment candidate for sepsis caused by MDR bacteria. Here, we performed sequence optimization to enhance the antimicrobial activity of this peptide and named it as AMPR-22 (antimicrobial peptide derived from Romo1). It showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against 17 sepsis-causing bacteria, including MDR strains, by inducing membrane permeabilization. Moreover, treatment with AMPR-22 enabled a remarkable survival rate in mice injected with MDR bacteria in a murine model of sepsis. Based on these results, we suggest that AMPR-22 could be prescribed as a first-line therapy (prior to bacterial identification) for patients diagnosed with sepsis.",2021-07-31
34360998,Selective Antifungal Activity and Fungal Biofilm Inhibition of Tryptophan Center Symmetrical Short Peptide.,"<i>Candida albicans</i>, an opportunistic fungus, causes dental caries and contributes to mucosal bacterial dysbiosis leading to a second infection. Furthermore, <i>C.</i><i>albicans</i> forms biofilms that are resistant to medicinal treatment. To make matters worse, antifungal resistance has spread (albeit slowly) in this species. Thus, it has been imperative to develop novel, antifungal drug compounds. Herein, a peptide was engineered with the sequence of RRFSFWFSFRR-NH2; this was named P19. This novel peptide has been observed to exert disruptive effects on fungal cell membrane physiology. Our results showed that P19 displayed high binding affinity to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and the plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), cardiolipin, and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), further indicating that the molecular mechanism of P19 was not associated with the receptor recognition, but rather related to competitive interaction with the plasma membrane. In addition, compared with fluconazole and amphotericin B, P19 has been shown to have a lower potential for resistance selection than established antifungal agents.",2021-07-30
34354046,"Gemcitabine and APG-1252, a novel small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2/BCL-XL, display a synergistic antitumor effect in nasopharyngeal carcinoma through the JAK-2/STAT3/MCL-1 signaling pathway.","Advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a poor prognosis, with an unfavorable response to palliative chemotherapy. Unfortunately, there are few effective therapeutic regimens. Therefore, we require novel treatment strategies with enhanced efficacy. The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor efficacy of APG-1252-M1, a dual inhibitor of BCL-2/BCL-XL, as a single agent and combined with gemcitabine. We applied various apoptotic assays and used subcutaneous transplanted NPC model to assess the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. Moreover, phospho-tyrosine kinase array was used to investigate the combined therapy's potential synergistic mechanism. In addition, further validation was performed using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. In vitro, we observed that APG-1252-M1 had moderate antitumor activity toward NPC cells; however, it markedly improved gemcitabine's ability to promote NPC cell apoptosis and suppress invasion, migration, and proliferation. Specifically, APG-1252 plus gemcitabine exhibited even remarkable antitumor activity in vivo. Mechanistically, the drug combination synergistically suppressed NPC by activating caspase-dependent pathways, blocking the phospho (p)-JAK-2/STAT3/MCL-1 signaling pathway, and inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, the results indicated that the combination of APG-1252 and gemcitabine has synergistic anticancer activities against NPC, providing a promising treatment modality for patients with NPC.",2021-08-05
34325312,LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of the anti-cancer agent infigratinib: Application for estimation of metabolic stability in human liver microsomes.,"Infigratinib (INF) is a novel small molecule, administered orally, which acts as a human fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) inhibitor. FGFRs are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) reported to be upregulated in various tumor cell types. In 1 December 2020, BridgeBio Pharma Inc. announced FDA approval of INF as a New Drug Application, granting it Priority Review for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Thus, the current study aimed to establish a validated LC-MS/MS method to estimate the INF concentration in the HLM matrix. In silico prediction of INF metabolism was done using the StarDrop® WhichP450™ module to verify its metabolic stability. An accurate and efficient LC-MS/MS analytical method was developed for INF metabolic stability evaluation. INF and duvelisib (DVB) (internal standard; IS) were eluted using an isocratic mobile phase with a C<sub>18</sub> column as a stationary reversed phase. The established LC-MS/MS method showed a linear range over 5-500 ng/mL (r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.9998) in human liver microsomes (HLMs). The sensitivity of the method was confirmed at its limit of quantification (4.71 ng/mL), and reproducibility was indicated by inter- and intra-day accuracy and precision (within 7.3%). The evaluation of INF metabolic stability was assessed, which reflected an intrinsic clearance of 23.6 µL/min/mg and in vitro half-life of 29.4 min. The developed approach in the current study is the first LC-MS/MS method for INF metabolic stability assessment. Application of the developed method in HLM in vitro studies suggests that INF has a moderate extraction ratio, indicating relatively good predicted oral bioavailability.",2021-07-02
34319169,A Novel Small Molecule Inhibits Hepatitis C Virus Propagation in Cell Culture.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause acute and chronic infection that is associated with considerable liver-related morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there has been a shift in the treatment paradigm with the discovery and approval of agents that target specific proteins vital for viral replication. We employed a cell culture-adapted strain of HCV and human hepatoma-derived cells lines to test the effects of our novel small-molecule compound (AO13) on HCV. Virus inhibition was tested by analyzing RNA replication, protein expression, and virus production in virus-infected cells treated with AO13. Treatment with AO13 inhibited virus spread in cell culture and showed a 100-fold reduction in the levels of infectious virus production. AO13 significantly reduced the level of viral RNA contained within cell culture fluids and reduced the cellular levels of HCV core protein, suggesting that the compound might act on a late step in the viral life cycle. Finally, we observed that AO13 did not affect the release of infectious virus from infected cells. Docking studies and molecular dynamics analyses suggested that AO13 might target the NS5B RNA polymerase, however, real-time RT-PCR analyses of cellular levels of HCV RNA showed only an ∼2-fold reduction in viral RNA levels in the presence of AO13. Taken together, this study revealed that AO13 showed consistent, but low-level antiviral effect against HCV, although the mechanism of action remains unclear. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The discovery of curative antiviral drugs for a chronic disease such as HCV infection has encouraged drug discovery in the context of other viruses for which no curative drugs currently exist. Since we currently face a novel virus that has caused a pandemic, the need for new antiviral agents is more apparent than ever. We describe here a novel compound that shows a modest antiviral effect against HCV that could serve as a lead compound for future drug development against other important viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.",2021-07-28
34315764,"Preclinical and Early Clinical Development of PTC596, a Novel Small-Molecule Tubulin-Binding Agent.","PTC596 is an investigational small-molecule tubulin-binding agent. Unlike other tubulin-binding agents, PTC596 is orally bioavailable and is not a P-glycoprotein substrate. So as to characterize PTC596 to position the molecule for optimal clinical development, the interactions of PTC596 with tubulin using crystallography, its spectrum of preclinical <i>in vitro</i> anticancer activity, and its pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship were investigated for efficacy in multiple preclinical mouse models of leiomyosarcomas and glioblastoma. Using X-ray crystallography, it was determined that PTC596 binds to the colchicine site of tubulin with unique key interactions. PTC596 exhibited broad-spectrum anticancer activity. PTC596 showed efficacy as monotherapy and additive or synergistic efficacy in combinations in mouse models of leiomyosarcomas and glioblastoma. PTC596 demonstrated efficacy in an orthotopic model of glioblastoma under conditions where temozolomide was inactive. In a first-in-human phase I clinical trial in patients with cancer, PTC596 monotherapy drug exposures were compared with those predicted to be efficacious based on mouse models. PTC596 is currently being tested in combination with dacarbazine in a clinical trial in adults with leiomyosarcoma and in combination with radiation in a clinical trial in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.",2021-07-26
34314086,"NV14 from serine O-acetyltransferase of cyanobacteria influences the antioxidant enzymes in vitro cells, gene expression against H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and other responses in vivo zebrafish larval model.","In this study, we have identified a novel peptide NV14 with antioxidative functions from serine O-acetyltransferase (SAT) of Artrospira platensis (Ap). The full sequence of ApSAT and its derived NV14 peptide ""NVRIGAGSVVLRDV"" (141-154) was characterized using bioinformatics tools. To address the transcriptional activity of ApSAT in response to induce generic oxidative stress, the spirulina culture was exposed to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> (10 mM). The ApSAT expression was studied using RT-PCR across various time points and it was found that the expression of the ApSAT was significantly upregulated on Day 15. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay against NV14 was performed in human dermal fibroblast cells and human blood leukocytes. Results showed that NV14 treatment was non-cytotoxic to the cells. Besides, in vivo treatment of NV14 in zebrafish larvae did not exhibit the signs of developmental toxicity. Further, the in vitro antioxidant assays enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and CAT, due to NV14 treatment; and also significantly reduced the MDA levels, while increasing the superoxide radical and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> scavenging activity. The expression of antioxidant enzyme genes glutathione peroxidase, γ-glutamyl cysteine synthase, and glutathione S-transferase were found to be upregulated in the NV14 peptide pretreated zebrafish larvae when induced with generic oxidative stress, H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> . Overall, the study showed that NV14 peptide possessed potent antioxidant properties, which were demonstrated over both in vitro and in vivo assays. NV14 enhanced the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes at the molecular level, thereby modulating and reversing the cellular antioxidant balance disrupted due to the H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -induced oxidative stress.",2021-08-15
34311097,Octopromycin: Antibacterial and antibiofilm functions of a novel peptide derived from Octopus minor against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.,"The emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has increased the risk of nosocomial infections, which pose a huge health threat. There is an urgent need to develop alternative therapies, including broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides. In this study, we designed, characterized, and studied the antibacterial, antibiofilm effects and possible mode of actions of a novel synthetic peptide Octopromycin, derived from the proline-rich protein 5 of Octopus minor. Octopromycin consists of 38 amino acids, (+5) net positive charge, high hydrophobic residue ratio (36%), and two α-helix secondary structures. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration against A. baumannii were 50 and 200 μg/mL, respectively. Time-kill kinetics and bacterial viability assays confirmed the concentration-dependent antibacterial activity of Octopromycin. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images clearly showed ultrastructural alterations in Octopromycin-treated A. baumannii cells. Propidium iodide penetrated into Octopromycin-treated A. baumannii cells, demonstrating the loss of cell membrane integrity. Octopromycin treatment increased the production of reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner, and it inhibited the biofilm formation and showed biofilm eradication activity against A. baumannii. In vitro and in vivo safety evaluation revealed that Octopromycin was nontoxic to HEK293T and Raw 264.7 cells (<400 μg/mL), as well as mice red blood cells (<300 μg/mL), and zebrafish embryos (<4 μg/mL). An in vivo study results revealed that the A. baumannii-infected fish treated with Octopromycin exhibited a significantly higher relative percent survival (37.5%) than the infected mock-treated fish with PBS (16.6%). Furthermore, a decreased bacterial load and fewer alterations in histological analysis confirmed the successful control of A. baumannii by Octopromycin in vivo. Collectively, the results indicate that the antibacterial peptide Octopromycin may achieve rapid control of A. baumannii through multi-target interactions; it presents a desirable therapeutic option for the prevention and control of the infections.",2021-07-23
34303079,Discovery and characterization of novel peptide inhibitors of the NRF2/MAFG/DNA ternary complex for the treatment of cancer.,"Pathway activating mutations of the transcription factor NRF2 and its negative regulator KEAP1 are strongly correlative with poor clinical outcome with pemetrexed/carbo(cis)platin/pembrolizumab (PCP) chemo-immunotherapy in lung cancer. Despite the strong genetic support and therapeutic potential for a NRF2 transcriptional inhibitor, currently there are no known direct inhibitors of the NRF2 protein or its complexes with MAF and/or DNA. Herein we describe the design of a novel and high-confidence homology model to guide a medicinal chemistry effort that resulted in the discovery of a series of peptides that demonstrate high affinity, selective binding to the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) DNA and thereby displace NRF2-MAFG from its promoter, which is an inhibitory mechanism that to our knowledge has not been previously described. In addition to their activity in electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and TR-FRET-based assays, we show significant dose-dependent ternary complex disruption of NRF2-MAFG binding to DNA by SPR, as well as cellular target engagement by thermal destabilization of HiBiT-tagged NRF2 in the NCI-H1944 NSCLC cell line upon digitonin permeabilization, and SAR studies leading to improved cellular stability. We report the characterization and unique profile of lead peptide 18, which we believe to be a useful in vitro tool to probe NRF2 biology in cancer cell lines and models, while also serving as an excellent starting point for additional in vivo optimization toward inhibition of NRF2-driven transcription to address a significant unmet medical need in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",2021-07-07
34297567,Discovery of Cyclic Peptidomimetic Ligands Targeting the Extracellular Domain of EGFR.,"It is very promising to target the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for developing novel and selective anticancer therapies. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel small molecule, <b>M-2-5</b>, from a one-bead-two-compound (OBTC) cyclic γ-AApeptide library. The molecule was found to bind tightly to the extracellular domain of EGFR. Intriguingly, this molecule could also effectively antagonize EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation and downstream signal transduction. Furthermore, together with its remarkable resistance to proteolytic degradation, <b>M-2-5</b> was shown to effectively inhibit cell proliferation and migration in vitro and suppresses the growth of tumor in the A549 xenograft model in vivo, highlighting its potential therapeutic application for cancer treatment.",2021-07-23
34297234,Physicochemical Characterization and Biopharmaceutical Evaluation of ZWF: A Novel Anticancer Drug for the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,"The orally available novel small molecule drug ZWF is under preclinical development for an anticancer purpose. The present study aimed to assess the viability of developing ZWF as a form of oral formulation for clinical application based on the principles of biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics. The crucial physicochemical properties of ZWF were determined by in vitro assays. The in situ gastrointestinal absorption characteristics and in vivo pharmacokinetic behaviors of ZWF in rats were characterized. The solubility of ZWF showed a highly pH-dependent profile, decreasing from 25,392.89 to 20.48 μg/mL as the solution pH increased from 1.0 to 5.8. In PBS with a pH of 1.0 to 5.8, the LogP value of ZWF ranged from -2.35 to 2.20 and was gradually increased as the pH value increased. ZWF was partially absorbed in the stomach, and the favorable absorption sites were the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the AUC<sub>(0-t)</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> values of ZWF after its oral administration as a suspension prepared with 0.5% CMC-Na were increased by 18.97% and 40% than that with normal saline, providing a model oral formulation of ZWF with ideal bioavailability and system exposure in rats. From the perspective of oral absorption, ZWF possessed appealing qualities as a drug candidate and could be prepared as an oral preparation for clinical application. The present study has established a fundamental foundation for the development and quality evaluation of the ZWF oral formulations.",2021-07-23
34283806,Systemic inhibition of PTPN22 augments anticancer immunity.,"Both epidemiologic and cellular studies in the context of autoimmune diseases have established that protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is a key regulator of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. However, its mechanism of action in tumors and its translatability as a target for cancer immunotherapy have not been established. Here we show that a germline variant of PTPN22, rs2476601, portended a lower likelihood of cancer in patients. PTPN22 expression was also associated with markers of immune regulation in multiple cancer types. In mice, lack of PTPN22 augmented antitumor activity with greater infiltration and activation of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and T cells. Notably, we generated a novel small molecule inhibitor of PTPN22, named L-1, that phenocopied the antitumor effects seen in genotypic PTPN22 knockout. PTPN22 inhibition promoted activation of CD8+ T cells and macrophage subpopulations toward MHC-II expressing M1-like phenotypes, both of which were necessary for successful antitumor efficacy. Increased PD1-PDL1 axis in the setting of PTPN22 inhibition could be further leveraged with PD1 inhibition to augment antitumor effects. Similarly, cancer patients with the rs2476601 variant responded significantly better to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Our findings suggest that PTPN22 is a druggable systemic target for cancer immunotherapy.",2021-07-20
34280398,A phycocyanin derived eicosapeptide attenuates lung fibrosis development.,"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a progressive respiratory disease. Phycocyanin derived eicosapeptide (PP20) is a novel peptide derived from active protein C-phycocyanin in Cyanobacteria. The aim of our study was to explore the anti-fibrotic activity of the PP20 and its underlying mechanism. Characteristic features of pulmonary fibrosis in oleic acid (OA)-induced mice and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TGF-β1-exposed A549 and HFL-1 cells with or without PP20 and the change of TGF-β/Smad and MAPK signaling pathways were examined. Smad and MAPK agonists were used to explore the role of TGF-β/Smad and MAPK signaling in TGF-β1- induced collagen I expression in A549 cells and α-SMA expression in HFL-1 cells when treated with PP20. Our results showed that PP20 significantly alleviated the inflammatory response and tissue destruction, inhibited EMT, restored the imbalance of TIMP-1/MMP-9 and reduced collagen fiber deposition. Moreover, PP20 inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT and collagen I expression in A549 cells. PP20 could also inhibit the proliferation, and decrease TGF-β1-induced the expression of collagen I and transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in HFL-1 cells. Additionally, animal experiments and cell experiments combined with pathway agonists have shown that PP20 can negatively regulate TGF-β/Smad and MAPK pathways and show anti-fibrotic properties. PP20 may be a promising drug candidate for protection against pulmonary fibrosis.",2021-07-16
34274316,"GSK137, a potent small-molecule BCL6 inhibitor with in vivo activity, suppresses antibody responses in mice.","B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor possessing a BTB-POZ (BR-C, ttk, and bab for BTB; pox virus and zinc finger for POZ) domain, which is required for homodimerization and association with corepressors. BCL6 has multiple roles in normal immunity, autoimmunity, and some types of lymphoma. Mice bearing disrupted BCL6 loci demonstrate suppressed high-affinity antibody responses to T-dependent antigens. The corepressor binding groove in the BTB-POZ domain is a potential target for small compound-mediated therapy. Several inhibitors targeting this binding groove have been described, but these compounds have limited or absent in vivo activity. Biophysical studies of a novel compound, GSK137, showed an in vitro pIC<sub>50</sub> of 8 and a cellular pIC<sub>50</sub> of 7.3 for blocking binding of a peptide derived from the corepressor silencing mediator for retinoid or thyroid hormone receptors to the BCL6 BTB-POZ domain. The compound has good solubility (128 μg/ml) and permeability (86 nM/s). GSK137 caused little change in cell viability or proliferation in four BCL6-expressing B-cell lymphoma lines, although there was modest dose-dependent accumulation of G1 phase cells. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice showed a profile compatible with achieving good levels of target engagement. GSK137, administered orally, suppressed immunoglobulin G responses and reduced numbers of germinal centers and germinal center B cells following immunization of mice with the hapten trinitrophenol. Overall, we report a novel small-molecule BCL6 inhibitor with in vivo activity that inhibits the T-dependent antigen immune response.",2021-07-15
34256351,Time to 'Mind the Gap' in novel small molecule drug discovery for direct-acting antivirals for SARS-CoV-2.,"A pipeline of effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) remains a critical gap in addressing the current pandemic given vaccination hesitancy, the emergence of viral variants of concern, susceptible populations for which vaccination is ineffective or unavailable, and the possibility that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is here to stay. Since the start of the pandemic, global efforts in small molecule drug discovery have focused largely on testing of FDA-approved drugs to accelerate evaluation in clinical trials in hospitalized patients. With 80% of the population who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 having asymptomatic to mild COVID-19, early stage, DAAs would be of enormous benefit to reduce spread, duration of symptoms and quarantine length. We highlight a few of the most promising DAAs in clinical trials and discuss considerations in how to navigate the challenges and pitfalls of novel small molecule discovery and thereby accelerate the advancement of new, safe, and oral DAAs.",2021-06-29

34249447,Monepantel antitumor activity is mediated through inhibition of major cell cycle and tumor growth signaling pathways.,"In women, epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynaecological malignancy-related deaths. Development of resistance to standard platinum and taxane based chemotherapy and recurrence of the disease necessitate development of novel drugs to halt disease progression. An established concept is to target molecular and signaling pathways that substantially contribute to development of drug resistance and disease progression. We have previously shown that, monepantel (MPL) a novel small molecule acetonitrile derivative is highly effective in suppressing growth, proliferation and colony formation of ovarian cancer cells. These effects are achieved through inhibition of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway in cancer cells. The present study was conducted to find in vivo corroboration and explore the effect of MPL om other growth stimulating putative signaling pathways. Here, female nude mice with subcutaneous OVCAR-3 xenografts were treated with 25 and 50 mg/kg doses of MPL administered (IP) three times weekly for 2 weeks. At the doses employed, MPL was modestly effective at suppressing tumor growth, but highly effective in inhibiting, mTOR, P70S6K and 4EBP1. There were also modest reductions in tumor cyclin D1 and retinoblastoma protein expression. Furthermore, it was found that MPL treatment causes down-regulation of IGF-1R, and c-MYC thus unveiling new dimensions to the growing antitumor actions of this potential anticancer drug. MPL treatment led to reduced tumor volume and weights without causing any detectable side effects. Coupled with the recent human safety data published on this molecule, expanded future trials are highly anticipated.",2021-06-15
34246853,Discovery and biological evaluation of phthalazines as novel non-kinase TGFβ pathway inhibitors.,"TGFβ is crucial for the homeostasis of epithelial and neural tissues, wound repair, and regulating immune responses. Its dysregulation is associated with a vast number of diseases, of which modifying the tumor microenvironment is one of vital clinical interest. Despite various attempts, there is still no FDA-approved therapy to inhibit the TGFβ pathway. Major mainstream approaches involve impairment of the TGFβ pathway via inhibition of the TGFβRI kinase. With the purpose to identify non-receptor kinase-based inhibitors to impair TGFβ signaling, an in-house chemical library was enriched, through a computational study, to eliminate TGFβRI kinase activity. Selected compounds were screened against a cell line engineered with a firefly luciferase gene under TGFβ-Smad-dependent transcriptional control. Results indicated moderate potency for a molecule with phthalazine core against TGFβ-Smad signaling. A series of phthalazine compounds were synthesized and evaluated for potency. The most promising compound (10p) exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.11 ± 0.02 μM and was confirmed to be non-cytotoxic up to 12 μM, with a selectivity index of approximately 112-fold. Simultaneously, 10p was confirmed to reduce the Smad phosphorylation using Western blot without exhibiting inhibition on the TGFβRI enzyme. This study identified a novel small-molecule scaffold that targets the TGFβ pathway via a non-receptor-kinase mechanism.",2021-06-19
34245947,Lead optimization to improve the antiviral potency of 2-aminobenzamide derivatives targeting HIV-1 Vif-A3G axis.,"The viral infectivity factor (Vif)-apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) axis has been recognized as a valid target for developing novel small-molecule therapies for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or for enhancing innate immunity against viruses. Our previous work reported the novel Vif antagonist 2-amino-N-(2-methoxyphenyl)-6-((4-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl)benzamide (2) with strong antiviral activity. In this work, through optimizations of ring C of 2, we discovered the more potent compound 6m with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.07 μM in non-permissive H9 cells, reflecting an approximately 5-fold enhancement of antiviral activity compared to that of 2. Western blotting indicated that 6m more strongly suppressed the defensive protein Vif than 2 at the same concentration. Furthermore, 6m suppressed the replication of various clinical drug-resistant HIV strains (FI, NRTI, NNRTI, IN and PI) with relatively high efficacy. These results suggested that compound 6m is a more potent candidate for treating AIDS.",2021-07-01
34242628,"Enhanced skin retention and permeation of a novel peptide via structural modification, chemical enhancement, and microneedles.","Hyperpigmentation is a common skin condition with serious psychosocial consequences. Decapeptide-12, a novel peptide, has been found to be safer than hydroquinone in reducing melanin content, with efficacy up to more than 50% upon 16 weeks of twice-daily treatment. However, the peptide suffers from limited transcutaneous penetration due to its hydrophilicity and high molecular weight. Therefore, decapeptide-12 was modified by adding a palmitate chain in an attempt to overcome this limitation. Molecular docking results showed that the two peptides exhibited similar biological activity towards tyrosinase. We also tested the effect of chemical penetration enhancers and microneedles to deliver the two peptides into and through skin, using an in vitro human skin permeation method. It was shown that the palm-peptide achieved the best skin retention owing to the increased lipophilicity. In addition, skin permeation of the palm-peptides was enhanced by the chemical skin penetration enhancers, namely, oleic acid and menthol. Skin permeation of the native peptide was enhanced by the microneedle patch but not the chemical skin penetration enhancers. Cutaneous absorption of the palm-peptides was estimated to have achieved its therapeutic concentration within skin. The combinatory approach of using molecular modification, chemical penetration enhancement, and microneedle patch proves to be useful to enhanceskin permeation of the peptides.",2021-07-06

34223158,Recent advances in the development of AHR antagonists in immuno-oncology.,"The arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand activated transcription factor that controls the expression of a number of immunosuppressive signaling molecules, including the immune checkpoint proteins PD-1/L1 and cytokine IL-10. AHR activation also stimulates the formation and recruitment of tolerogenic dendritic cells, tumor associated macrophages, and regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment, which restrains antitumoral immune response. Overexpression of AHR has been observed in a number of different types of cancer and suggested to contribute to immune dysfunction and cancer progression. One prominent endogenous ligand of AHR is the oncometabolite kynurenine, a product of tryptophan metabolism catalyzed by the dioxygenases IDO1 and TDO that are often aberrantly activated in cancer. AHR has gained significant interest as a drug target for the development of novel small molecule cancer immunotherapies, as evidenced by the advancement of two clinical candidates into phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer.

34208230,Interaction of Temporin-L Analogues with the <i>E. coli</i> FtsZ Protein.,"The research of new therapeutic agents to fight bacterial infections has recently focused on the investigation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), the most common weapon that all organisms produce to prevent invasion by external pathogens. Among AMPs, the amphibian Temporins constitute a well-known family with high antibacterial properties against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, Temporin-L was shown to affect bacterial cell division by inhibiting FtsZ, a tubulin-like protein involved in the crucial step of Z-ring formation at the beginning of the division process. As FtsZ represents a leading target for new antibacterial compounds, in this paper we investigated in detail the interaction of Temporin L with <i>Escherichia coli</i> FtsZ and designed two TL analogues in an attempt to increase peptide-protein interactions and to better understand the structural determinants leading to FtsZ inhibition. The results demonstrated that the TL analogues improved their binding to FtsZ, originating stable protein-peptide complexes. Functional studies showed that both peptides were endowed with a high capability of inhibiting both the enzymatic and polymerization activities of the protein. Moreover, the TL analogues were able to inhibit bacterial growth at low micromolar concentrations. These observations may open up the way to the development of novel peptide or peptidomimetic drugs tailored to bind FtsZ, hampering a crucial process of bacterial life that might be proposed for future pharmaceutical applications.",2021-06-11
34206125,Development of Peptide-Based Nanoparticles for Mitochondrial Plasmid DNA Delivery.,"A mitochondrion is a cellular organelle able to produce cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). As in the nucleus, mitochondria contain their own genome: the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This genome is particularly susceptible to mutations that are at the basis of a multitude of disorders, especially those affecting the heart, the central nervous system and muscles. Conventional clinical practice applied to mitochondrial diseases is very limited and ineffective; a clear need for innovative therapies is demonstrated. Gene therapy seems to be a promising approach. The use of mitochondrial DNA as a therapeutic, optimized by peptide-based complexes with mitochondrial targeting, can be seen as a powerful tool in the reestablishment of normal mitochondrial function. In line with this requirement, in this work and for the first time, a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (MTS) has been incorporated into previously researched peptides, to confer on them a targeting ability. These peptides were then considered to complex a plasmid DNA (pDNA) which contains the mitochondrial gene ND1 (mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1 protein), aiming at the formation of peptide-based nanoparticles. Currently, the ND1 plasmid is one of the most advanced bioengineered vectors for conducting research on mitochondrial gene expression. The formed complexes were characterized in terms of pDNA complexation capacity, morphology, size, surface charge and cytotoxic profile. These data revealed that the developed carriers possess suitable properties for pDNA delivery. Furthermore, in vitro studies illustrated the mitochondrial targeting ability of the novel peptide/pDNA complexes. A comparison between the different complexes revealed the most promising ones that complex pDNA and target mitochondria. This may contribute to the optimization of peptide-based non-viral systems to target mitochondria, instigating progress in mitochondrial gene therapy.",2021-06-01
34199417,Discovery of Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 Interaction via Structural Simplification Strategy.,"Blockade of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) interaction is currently the focus in the field of cancer immunotherapy, and so far, several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have achieved encouraging outcomes in cancer treatment. Despite this achievement, mAbs-based therapies are struggling with limitations including poor tissue and tumor penetration, long half-life time, poor oral bioavailability, and expensive production costs, which prompted a shift towards the development of the small-molecule inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 pathways. Even though many small-molecule inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have been reported, their development lags behind the corresponding mAb, partly due to the challenges of developing drug-like small molecules. Herein, we report the discovery of a series of novel inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 interaction via structural simplification strategy by using BMS-1058 as a starting point. Among them, compound <b>A9</b> stands out as the most promising candidate with excellent PD-L1 inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.93 nM, LE = 0.43) and high binding affinity to hPD-L1 (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub> = 3.64 nM, LE = 0.40). Furthermore, <b>A9</b> can significantly promote the production of IFN-γ in a dose-dependent manner by rescuing PD-L1 mediated T-cell inhibition in Hep3B/OS-8/hPD-L1 and CD3-positive T cells co-culture assay. Taken together, these results suggest that <b>A9</b> is a promising inhibitor of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and is worthy for further study.",2021-06-02

34191515,Optimization of CAR-T Cell-Based Therapies Using Small-Molecule-Based Safety Switches.,"Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy has demonstrated antileukemia efficacy. However, this therapeutic approach is hampered by severe cytokine release syndrome, which is a major impediment to its widespread application in the clinic. The safety of this approach can be improved by engineering a rapid and reversible ""off"" or ""on"" safety switch for CAR-T cells. Cutting-edge investigations combining the advantages of genetic engineering and chemical technology have led to the invention of small-molecule-based safety switches for CAR-T cells. Small molecules such as FITC, folate, rimiducid, rapamycin, proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) compounds, and dasatinib are being investigated to design such safety switches. Optimized CAR-T cells may have enhanced therapeutic efficiency with fewer adverse effects. Herein we summarize and classify current novel small-molecule-based safety switches for CAR-T cells that aim to provide pharmacological control over the activities and toxicities associated with CAR-T cell-based cancer immunotherapies.",2021-06-30
34174477,Comprehensive proteomic analysis reveals distinct functional modules associated with skull base and supratentorial meningiomas and perturbations in collagen pathway components.,"Meningiomas are brain tumors that originate from the meninges and has been primarily classified into three grades by the current WHO guidelines. Although widely prevalent and can be managed by surgery there are instances when the tumors are located in difficult regions. This results in considerable challenges for complete surgical resection and further clinical management. While the genetic signature of the skull base tumors is now known to be different from the non-skull base tumors, there is a lack of information at the functional aspects of these tumors at the proteomic level. Thus, the current study thereby aims to obtain mechanistic insights between the two radiologically distinct groups of meningiomas, namely the skull base & supratentorial (non-skull base-NSB) regions. We have employed a comprehensive mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomic analysis in Skull base and supratentorial meningiomas. Further, we have used an Artificial Neural Networking employing a sparse Multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture to predict protein concordance. A patient-derived spectral library has been employed for a novel peptide-level validation of proteins that are specific to the radiological regions using the SRM assay based targeted proteomics approach. The comprehensive proteomics enabled the identification of nearly 4000 proteins with high confidence (1%FDR ≥ 2 unique peptides) among which 170 proteins were differentially abundant in Skull base vs Supratentorial tumors (p-value ≤0.05). In silico analysis enabled mapping of the major alterations and hinted towards an overall perturbation of extracellular matrix and collagen biosynthesis components in the non-skull base meningiomas and a prominent perturbation of molecular trafficking in the skull base meningiomas. Therefore, this study has yielded novel insights into the functional association of the proteins that are differentially abundant in the two radiological subgroups. SIGNIFICANCE: In the current study, we have performed label-free proteomic analysis on fresh frozen tissue of 14 Supratentorial (NSB) and 7 Skull base meningiomas to assess perturbations in the global proteome, we have further employed an in-depth in silico analysis to map the pathways that have enabled functional mapping of the differentially abundant proteins in the Skull base and Supratentorial tumors. The findings from the above were also subjected to a machine learning-based neural networking to find out the proteins that have the most concordance of occurrence to determine the most influential proteins of the network. We further validated the differential abundance of identified protein markers in a larger patient cohort of Skull base and Supratentorial employing targeted proteomics approach to validate key protein candidates emerging from ours and other recent studies. The previous studies that have explored the skull base and convexity meningiomas have been able to reveal alterations in the genetic mutations in these tumor types. However, there are not many studies that have explored the functional aspects of these tumors, especially at the proteome level. We have attempted for the first time to map the functional modules associated with altered proteins in these tumors and have been able to identify that there is a possibility that the Skull base meningiomas to be considerably different from the Non-skull base (NSB) tumors in terms of the perturbed pathways. Our study employed global as well as targeted proteomics to examine the proteomic alterations in these two tumor groups. The study indicates that proteins that were more abundant in Skull base tumors were part of molecular transport components, non-skull base proteins majorly mapped to the components of extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. In conclusion, this study substantiates the distinction in the proteomic signatures in the skull base and supratentorial meningiomas paving way for further investigation of the identified markers for determining if some of these proteins can be used for therapeutic interventions for cases that pose considerable challenges for complete resection.",2021-06-24
34170848,Computational study on new natural compound agonists of dopamine receptor.,"Dopamine receptor, a polypeptide chain composed of 7 hydrophobic transmembrane regions, is a new and vital drug target, especially Dopamine receptor 2(D2). Targeting dopamine receptors, Dopamine receptor agonists are a class of drugs similar in function and structure to dopamine and can directly act on dopamine receptors and activate it. Clinically, Dopamine receptor agonist drugs have achieved significant therapeutic effects on prolactinoma and Parkinson's Disease. In the study, we virtually screened a series of potential effective agonists of Dopamine receptor by computer techniques. Firstly, we used the Molecular Docking (LibDock) step to screen out some molecules that can dock well with the protein. Then, analysis of toxicity prediction and ADME (adsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) were carried out. More precise molecular docking (CDOCKER) and 3-Dimensional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Modeling Study(3D-QSAR) pharmacophore generation were implemented to research and explore these compounds' binding mechanism with Dopamine receptor. Last but not least, to assess compound's binding stabilities, we carried out a molecular dynamic analysis. As the results show, two compounds (ZINC000008860530 and ZINC000004096987) from the small molecule database (ZINC database) were potential effective agonists of Dopamine receptor. These two compounds can combine with Dopamine receptor with higher affinity and proved to be no toxic. The cell experiment showed that two compounds could inhibit the proliferation and PRL secretion of MMQ cells (pituitary tumor cells). Thus, this study provided valuable information about Dopamine receptor agonist-based drug discovery. So, this study will benefit patients with prolactinoma and Parkinson's disease a lot.",2021-06-25
34158350,A Novel Nrf2 Pathway Inhibitor Sensitizes Keap1-Mutant Lung Cancer Cells to Chemotherapy.,"The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-Keap1-ARE pathway, a master regulator of oxidative stress, has emerged as a promising target for cancer therapy. Mutations in <i>NFE2L2, KEAP1</i>, and related genes have been found in many human cancers, especially lung cancer. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the Nrf2 pathway, which promotes proliferation of cancer cells and their resistance to chemotherapies. Small molecules that inhibit the Nrf2 pathway are needed to arrest tumor growth and overcome chemoresistance in Nrf2-addicted cancers. Here, we identified a novel small molecule, MSU38225, which can suppress Nrf2 pathway activity. MSU38225 downregulates Nrf2 transcriptional activity and decreases the expression of Nrf2 downstream targets, including NQO1, GCLC, GCLM, AKR1C2, and UGT1A6. MSU38225 strikingly decreases the protein level of Nrf2, which can be blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Ubiquitination of Nrf2 is enhanced following treatment with MSU38225. By inhibiting production of antioxidants, MSU38225 increases the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when cells are stimulated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP). MSU38225 also inhibits the growth of human lung cancer cells in both two-dimensional cell culture and soft agar. Cancer cells addicted to Nrf2 are more susceptible to MSU38225 for suppression of cell proliferation. MSU38225 also sensitizes human lung cancer cells to chemotherapies both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> Our results suggest that MSU38225 is a novel Nrf2 pathway inhibitor that could potentially serve as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the response to chemotherapies in patients with lung cancer.",2021-06-22
34153665,Inhibition of neuroinflammation by MIF inhibitor 3-({[4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-methyl-2-pyrimidinyl]thio}1methyl)benzoic acid (Z-312).,"Microglial overactivation-mediated neuroinflammation contributes greatly to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in the pathophysiology of various inflammatory diseases by inducing various proinflammatory cytokines. Compound 3-({[4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-methyl-2-pyrimidinyl]thio}methyl)benzoic acid (Z-312) is a novel small -molecule inhibitor of MIF tautomeric activity. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Z-312 on liposaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that Z-312 significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated microglial cells. Mechanistically, nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα, NF-κB transcriptional activity and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and JNK were markedly attenuated by pretreatment with Z-312 in BV-2 microglial cells. In addition, Z-312 suppressed the neurotoxic effects of cell culture medium of LPS-activated BV-2 microglia on cocultured mouse HT22 neuroblastoma cells. An in vivo study demonstrated that Z-312 markedly ameliorated microglial activation and subsequent DA neuron loss in an LPS-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model. These results suggest that MIF inhibitor Z-312 may be a promising neuroprotective agent for the treatment of neuroinflammation-mediated neurological diseases.",2021-06-19
34152872,GSK3 Inhibitor-Induced Dentinogenesis Using a Hydrogel.,"Small-molecule drugs targeting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as inhibitors of the protein kinase activity are able to stimulate reparative dentine formation. To develop this approach into a viable clinical treatment for exposed pulp lesions, we synthesized a novel, small-molecule noncompetitive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drug that can be incorporated into a biodegradable hydrogel for placement by syringe into the tooth. This new drug, named NP928, belongs to the thiadiazolidinone (TDZD) family and has equivalent activity to similar drugs of this family such as tideglusib. However, NP928 is more water soluble than other TDZD drugs, making it more suitable for direct delivery into pulp lesions. We have previously reported that biodegradable marine collagen sponges can successfully deliver TDZD drugs to pulp lesions, but this involves in-theater preparation of the material, which is not ideal in a clinical context. To improve surgical handling and delivery, here we incorporated NP928 into a specifically tailored hydrogel that can be placed by syringe into a damaged tooth. This hydrogel is based on biodegradable hyaluronic acid and can be gelled in situ upon dental blue light exposure, similarly to other common dental materials. NP928 released from hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels upregulated Wnt/β-catenin activity in pulp stem cells and fostered reparative dentine formation compared to marine collagen sponges delivering equivalent concentrations of NP928. This drug-hydrogel combination has the potential to be rapidly developed into a therapeutic procedure that is amenable to general dental practice.",2021-06-21
34151714,"Toci or not toci: innovations in the diagnosis, prevention, and early management of cytokine release syndrome.","Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remains a significant toxicity of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy for hematologic malignancies. While established guidelines exist for the management of Grade 2+ CRS with immunosuppressive agents such as tocilizumab or corticosteroids, the management of early-grade CRS (i.e. Grade 1 CRS with isolated fevers) has no such consensus beyond supportive care. In this review, we discuss early-grade CRS with an emphasis on its diagnosis, management, and prevention. Strategies to target early-grade CRS include immunosuppression preemptively (once CRS develops) or prophylactically (before CRS develops) as well as novel small-molecule inhibitors or fractionated CAR-T dosing. In the near future, next-generation CAR-T therapies may be able to target CRS precisely or obviate CRS entirely. If shown to prevent CRS-associated morbidity while maintaining therapeutic anti-neoplastic efficacy, these innovative strategies will enhance the safety of CAR-T therapy while also improving its operationalization and accessibility in the real-world setting.",2021-06-21

34142718,Acute morphine blocks spinal respiratory motor plasticity via long-latency mechanisms that require toll-like receptor 4 signalling.,"While respiratory complications following opioid use are mainly mediated via activation of mu opioid receptors, long-latency off-target signalling via innate immune toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may impair other essential elements of breathing control such as respiratory motor plasticity. In adult rats, pre-treatment with a single dose of morphine blocked long-term facilitation (LTF) of phrenic motor output via a long-latency TLR4-dependent mechanism. In the phrenic motor nucleus, morphine triggered TLR4-dependent activation of microglial p38 MAPK - a key enzyme that orchestrates inflammatory signalling and is known to undermine phrenic LTF. Morphine-induced LTF loss may destabilize breathing, potentially contributing to respiratory side effects. Therefore, we suggest minimizing TLR-4 signalling may improve breathing stability during opioid therapy.",2021-07-06
34136753,Novel Peptide-drug Conjugate Melflufen Efficiently Eradicates Bortezomib-resistant Multiple Myeloma Cells Including Tumor-initiating Myeloma Progenitor Cells.,"Introduction of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has dramatically improved clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma. However, most patients become refractory to bortezomib-based therapies. On the molecular level, development of resistance to bortezomib in myeloma cells is accompanied by complex metabolic changes resulting in increased protein folding capacity, and less dependency on the proteasome. In this study, we show that aminopeptidase B, encoded by the <i>RNPEP</i> gene, is upregulated in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cell lines, and in a murine in vivo model. Moreover, increased <i>RNPEP</i> expression is associated with shorter survival in multiple myeloma patients previously treated with bortezomib-containing regimens. Additionally, expression is increased in plasma cell precursors, a B-lymphoid compartment previously associated with myeloma stem cells. We hypothesized that increased aminopeptidase B expression in aggressive myeloma clones may be used therapeutically toward elimination of the cells via the use of a novel peptide-drug conjugate, melphalan flufenamide (melflufen). Melflufen, a substrate of aminopeptidase B, efficiently eliminates bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo, and completely suppresses clonogenic myeloma growth in vitro at subphysiological concentrations. Thus, melflufen represents a novel treatment option that is able to eradicate drug-resistant myeloma clones characterized by elevated aminopeptidase B expression.",2021-06-12
34133900,TLR1/2 Agonist Enhances Reversal of HIV-1 Latency and Promotes NK Cell-Induced Suppression of HIV-1-Infected Autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells.,"The complete eradication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is blocked by latent reservoirs in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and myeloid lineage cells. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can induce the reversal of HIV-1 latency and trigger the innate immune response. To the best of our knowledge, there is little evidence showing the ""killing"" effect of TLR1/2 agonists but only a small ""shock"" potential. To identify a new approach for eradicating the HIV latent reservoir, we evaluated the effectiveness of SMU-Z1, a novel small-molecule TLR1/2 agonist, in the ""shock-and-kill"" strategy. The results showed that SMU-Z1 could enhance latent HIV-1 transcription not only <i>ex vivo</i> in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from aviremic HIV-1-infected donors receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but also <i>in vitro</i> in cells of myeloid-monocytic origin targeting the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Interestingly, the activation marker CD69 was significantly upregulated in natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and monocytes 48 h after SMU-Z1 treatment. Furthermore, SMU-Z1 was able to activate T cells without global T cell activation, as well as increasing NK cell degranulation and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production, which further block HIV-1-infected CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes. In summary, the present study found that SMU-Z1 can both enhance HIV-1 transcription and promote NK cell-mediated inhibition of HIV-1-infected autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. These findings indicate that the novel TLR1/2 agonist SMU-Z1 is a promising latency-reversing agent (LRA) for eradication of HIV-1 reservoirs. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Multiple <i>in vivo</i> studies showed that many LRAs used in the shock-and-kill approach could activate viral transcription but could not induce killing effectively. Therefore, a dual-function LRA is needed for elimination of HIV-1 reservoirs. We previously developed a small-molecule TLR1/2 agonist, SMU-Z1, and demonstrated that it could upregulate NK cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with immune adjuvant and antitumor properties <i>in vivo</i>. In the present study, SMU-Z1 could activate innate immune cells without global T cell activation, induce production of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines, and enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. We showed that SMU-Z1 displayed dual potential <i>ex vivo</i> in the shock of exposure of latently HIV-1-infected cells and in the kill of clearance of infected cells, which is critical for effective use in combination with therapeutic vaccines or broadly neutralizing antibody treatments aimed at curing AIDS.",2021-08-10
34116264,"Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of 1-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine derivatives as novel small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.","Blockade of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) signalling pathway is a promising tumour immunotherapeutic approach, and small molecule drugs have more advantages than monoclonal antibody macromolecules in clinical applications. Therefore, a series of 1-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine derivatives as PD-1/PD-L1 interaction novel small-molecule inhibitors were designed employing a ring fusion strategy. The inhibitory activity of compounds was evaluated by the HTRF assay, among which D38 was identified as the most potent PD-1/PD-L1 interaction inhibitor with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 9.6 nM. Furthermore, D38 exhibited prominent inhibitory activity against the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.61 μM in a coculture model of PD-L1/TCR activator-expressing CHO cells and PD-1-expressing Jurkat cells. In addition, the preliminary structure-activity relationships (SARs) of compounds were elucidated, and the binding mode of D38 with the PD-L1 dimer was analysed by molecular docking. Overall, D38 could be employed as a prospective lead compound of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction inhibitors for further development.",2021-05-30
34116044,Novel small molecule inhibitors of the transcription factor ETS-1 and their antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma.,"The transcription factor ETS-1 (E26 transformation specific sequence 1) is the key regulator for malignant tumor cell proliferation and invasion by mediating the transcription of the invasion/migration related factors, e.g. MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases). This work aims to identify the novel small molecule inhibitors of ETS-1 using a small molecule compound library and to study the inhibitors' antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The luciferase reporter is used to examine the inhibition and activation of ETS-1's transcription factor activity in HCC cells, including a highly invasive HCC cell line, MHCC97-H, and five lines of patient-derived cells. The inhibition of the proliferation of HCC cells is examined using the MTT assay, while the invasion of HCC cells is examined using the transwell assay. The anti-tumor activity of the selected compound on HCC cells is also examined in a subcutaneous tumor model or intrahepatic tumor model in nude mice. The results show that for the first time, four compounds, EI1~EI-4, can inhibit the transcription factor activation of ETS-1 and the proliferation or invasion of HCC cells. Among the four compounds, EI-4 has the best activation. The results from this paper contribute to expanding our understanding of ETS-1 and provide alternative, the safer and more effective, HCC molecular therapy strategies.",2021-06-08
34103689,Inhibition of Nav1.7 channel by a novel blocker QLS-81 for alleviation of neuropathic pain.,"Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 robustly expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons has been considered as a therapeutic target for chronic pain, but there is no selective Nav1.7 inhibitor available for therapy of chronic pain. Ralfinamide has shown anti-nociceptive activity in animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain and is currently under phase III clinical trial for neuropathic pain. Based on ralfinamide, a novel small molecule (S)-2-((3-(4-((2-fluorobenzyl) oxy) phenyl) propyl) amino) propanamide (QLS-81) was synthesized. Here, we report the electrophysiological and pharmacodynamic characterization of QLS-81 as a Nav1.7 channel inhibitor with promising anti-nociceptive activity. In whole-cell recordings of HEK293 cells stably expressing Nav1.7, QLS-81 (IC<sub>50</sub> at 3.5 ± 1.5 μM) was ten-fold more potent than its parent compound ralfinamide (37.1 ± 2.9 μM) in inhibiting Nav1.7 current. QLS-81 inhibition on Nav1.7 current was use-dependent. Application of QLS-81 (10 μM) caused a hyperpolarizing shift of the fast and slow inactivation of Nav1.7 channel about 7.9 mV and 26.6 mV, respectively, and also slowed down the channel fast and slow inactivation recovery. In dissociated mouse DRG neurons, QLS-81 (10 μM) inhibited native Nav current and suppressed depolarizing current pulse-elicited neuronal firing. Administration of QLS-81 (2, 5, 10 mg· kg<sup>-1</sup>· d<sup>-1</sup>, i.p.) in mice for 10 days dose-dependently alleviated spinal nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain and formalin-induced inflammatory pain. In addition, QLS-81 (10 μM) did not significantly affect ECG in guinea pig heart ex vivo; and administration of QLS-81 (10, 20 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice had no significant effect on spontaneous locomotor activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that QLS-81, as a novel Nav1.7 inhibitor, is efficacious on chronic pain in mice, and it may hold developmental potential for pain therapy.",2021-06-08
34093983,A novel bioengineered fragment peptide of Vasostatin-1 exerts smooth muscle pharmacological activities and anti-angiogenic effects via blocking VEGFR signalling pathway.,"Chromogranin A (CgA) is a hydrophilic glycoprotein released by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons. CgA consists of a single peptide chain containing numerous paired basic residues, which are typical cleavage sites in prohormones to generate bioactive peptides. It is recognized as a diagnostic and prognostic serum marker for neuroendocrine tumours. Vasostatin-1 is one of the most conserved regions of CgA and has diverse inhibitory biological activities. In this study, a novel peptide fragment that contains three typical functional structures of Vasostatin-1 was synthesized. This unique bioengineered Vasostatin-1 Derived Peptide (named V1DP) includes a highly conserved domain between vertebrate species in its N-terminal region, comprising a disulphide bridge formed by two cysteine residues at amino acid positions 17 and 38, respectively. Besides, V1DP contains two significant tripeptide recognition sequences: the amino acid triplets, RGD and KGD. Our data demonstrated that V1DP could induce a dose-dependent relaxation of rat arterial smooth muscle and also increase the contraction activity of rat uterus smooth muscle. More importantly, we found that V1DP inhibits cancer cell proliferation, modulate the HUVEC cell migration, and exhibit anti-angiogenesis effect both in <i>vitro</i> and in <i>vivo.</i> We further investigated the actual mechanism of V1DP, and our results confirmed that V1DP involves inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) signalling. We docked V1DP to the apo structures of VEGFR2 and examined the stability of the peptide in the protein pockets. Our simulation and free energy calculations results indicated that V1DP can bind to the catalytic domain and regulatory domain pockets, depending on whether the conformational state of the protein is JM-in or JM-out. Taken together, our data suggested that V1DP plays a role as the regulator of endothelial cell function and smooth muscle pharmacological homeostasis. V1DP is a water-soluble and biologically stable peptide and could further develop as an anti-angiogenic drug for cancer treatment.",2021-05-03
34080276,The pleiotropic roles of circular and long noncoding RNAs in cutaneous melanoma.,"Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a very aggressive disease, often characterized by unresponsiveness to conventional therapies and high mortality rates worldwide. The identification of the activating BRAF<sup>V600</sup> mutations in approximately 50% of CM patients has recently fueled the development of novel small-molecule inhibitors that specifically target BRAF<sup>V600</sup> -mutant CM. In addition, a major progress in CM treatment has been made by monoclonal antibodies that regulate the immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, although target-based therapies and immunotherapeutic strategies have yielded promising results, CM treatment remains a major challenge. In the last decade, accumulating evidence points to the aberrant expression of different types of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in CM. While studies on microRNAs have grown exponentially leading to significant insights on CM biology, the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this tumor is less understood, and much remains to be discovered. Here, we summarize and critically review the available evidence on the molecular functions of circRNAs and lncRNAs in BRAF<sup>V600</sup> -mutant CM and CM immunogenicity, providing recent updates on their functional role in targeted therapy and immunotherapy resistance. In addition, we also include an evaluation of several algorithms and databases for prediction and validation of circRNA and lncRNA functional interactions.",2021-06-18
34075191,"Analysis of the metabolomic profile in serum of irradiated nonhuman primates treated with Ex-Rad, a radiation countermeasure.","To date, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four drugs to mitigate hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome and all four are repurposed radiomitigators. There are several additional drug candidates currently under evaluation that may also be helpful for use during a widespread emergency. One possible candidate is Ex-Rad, also known as ON01210, a chlorobenzyl sulfone derivative (organosulfur compound), which is a novel, small-molecule kinase inhibitor with demonstrated efficacy in the murine model. In this study, we have evaluated the metabolomic and lipidomic profiles in serum samples of nonhuman primates (NHPs) treated with Ex-Rad after exposure to ionizing radiation. Two different dose administration schedules (Ex-Rad I administered 24 and 36 h post-irradiation, and Ex-Rad II administered 48 and 60 h post-irradiation), were used and evaluated using a global molecular profiling approach. We observed alterations in biochemical pathways relating to inflammation and oxidative stress after radiation exposure that were alleviated in animals that received Ex-Rad I or Ex-Rad II. The results from this study lend credence to the possible radiomitigative effects of this drug possibly via a dampening of metabolism-based tissue injury, thus aiding in recovery of vital, radiation-injured organ systems.",2021-06-01
34072728,"In-Silico Evaluation of Genetic Alterations in Ovarian Carcinoma and Therapeutic Efficacy of NSC777201, as a Novel Multi-Target Agent for TTK, NEK2, and CDK1.","Ovarian cancer is often detected at the advanced stages at the time of initial diagnosis. Early-stage diagnosis is difficult due to its asymptomatic nature, where less than 30% of 5-year survival has been noticed. The underlying molecular events associated with the disease's pathogenesis have yet to be fully elucidated. Thus, the identification of prognostic biomarkers as well as developing novel therapeutic agents for targeting these markers become relevant. Herein, we identified 264 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common in four ovarian cancer datasets (GSE14407, GSE18520, GSE26712, GSE54388), respectively. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) interaction network with the overexpressed genes (72 genes) and performed gene enrichment analysis. In the PPI networks, three proteins; TTK Protein Kinase (TTK), NIMA Related Kinase 2 (NEK2), and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1) with higher node degrees were further evaluated as therapeutic targets for our novel multi-target small molecule NSC777201. We found that the upregulated DEGs were enriched in KEGG and gene ontologies associated with ovarian cancer progression, female gamete association, otic vesicle development, regulation of chromosome segregation, and therapeutic failure. In addition to the PPI network, ingenuity pathway analysis also implicate TTK, NEK2, and CDK1 in the elevated salvage pyrimidine and pyridoxal pathways in ovarian cancer. The TTK, NEK2, and CDK1 are over-expressed, demonstrating a high frequency of genetic alterations, and are associated with poor prognosis of ovarian cancer cohorts. Interestingly, NSC777201 demonstrated anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activities (GI<sub>50</sub> = 1.6 µM~1.82 µM and TGI<sub>50</sub> = 3.5 µM~3.63 µM) against the NCI panels of ovarian cancer cell lines and exhibited a robust interaction with stronger affinities for TTK, NEK2, and CDK1, than do the standard drug, paclitaxel. NSC777201 displayed desirable properties of a drug-like candidate and thus could be considered as a novel small molecule for treating ovarian carcinoma.",2021-05-31
34065201,Simultaneous Inhibition of Three Major Cytokines and Its Therapeutic Effects: A Peptide-Based Novel Therapy against Endotoxemia in Mice.,"Three major cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6, mediate endotoxemia-induced liver injury. With the similar structures to the binding domains of the three cytokines to their cognate receptors, the novel peptide KCF18 can simultaneously inhibit TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. We elucidated whether KCF18 can alleviate injury of liver in endotoxemic mice. Adult male mice (BALB/cJ) were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 15 mg/kg; LPS group) or LPS with KCF18 (LKCF group). Mice in the LKCF group received KCF18 (i.p.) at 2 h (0.6 mg/kg), 4 h (0.3 mg/kg), 6 h (0.3 mg/kg), and 8 h (0.3mg/kg) after LPS administration. Mice were sacrificed after receiving LPS for 24 h. Our results indicated that the binding levels of the three cytokines to their cognate receptors in liver tissues in the LKCF group were significantly lower than those in the LPS group (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). The liver injury level, as measured by performing functional and histological analyses and by determining the tissue water content and vascular permeability (all <i>p</i> < 0.05), was significantly lower in the LKCF group than in the LPS group. Similarly, the levels of inflammation (macrophage activation, cytokine upregulation, and leukocyte infiltration), oxidation, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and apoptosis (all <i>p</i> < 0.05) in liver tissues in the LKCF group were significantly lower than those in the LPS group. In conclusion, the KCF18 peptide-based simultaneous inhibition of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 can alleviate liver injury in mice with endotoxemia.",2021-05-20
34058071,"Translational and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic application for the clinical development of GDC-0334, a novel TRPA1 inhibitor.","GDC-0334 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of transient receptor potential cation channel member A1 (TRPA1), a promising therapeutic target for many nervous system and respiratory diseases. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of GDC-0334 were evaluated in this first-in-human (FIH) study. A starting single dose of 25 mg was selected based on integrated preclinical PK, PD, and toxicology data following oral administration of GDC-0334 in guinea pigs, rats, dogs, and monkeys. Human PK and PK-PD of GDC-0334 were characterized after single and multiple oral dosing using a population modeling approach. The ability of GDC-0334 to inhibit dermal blood flow (DBF) induced by topical administration of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) was evaluated as a target-engagement biomarker. Quantitative models were developed iteratively to refine the parameter estimates of the dose-concentration-effect relationships through stepwise estimation and extrapolation. Human PK analyses revealed that bioavailability, absorption rate constant, and lag time increase when GDC-0334 was administered with food. The inhibitory effect of GDC-0334 on the AITC-induced DBF biomarker exhibited a clear sigmoid-Emax relationship with GDC-0334 plasma concentrations in humans. This study leveraged emerging preclinical and clinical data to enable iterative refinement of GDC-0334 mathematical models throughout the FIH study for dose selection in subsequent cohorts throughout the study.

GDC-0334 is a novel, small molecule TRPA1 inhibitor and a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling strategy could be implemented in a systematic and step-wise manner to build and learn from emerging data for early clinical development. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? Can noncompartmental and population-based analyses be used to describe the PK and PD characteristics of GDC-0334 in preclinical and clinical studies? WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? GDC-0334 exposure generally increased with dose in rats, dogs, and monkeys. The starting dose (25 mg) in the clinical study was determined based on the preclinical data. GDC-0334 exhibited linear PK in humans and the bioavailability was increased with food. The inhibitory effect of GDC-0334 on dermal blood flow induced by the TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate in humans indicates a clear PK-PD relationship. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? The models developed based on TRPA1 agonist-induced dermal blood flow inhibition data can be used to predict PK-PD relationships in future preclinical and clinical studies evaluating new drug entities that target TRPA1.",2021-05-31
34057732,"DNA damage repair in glioblastoma: current perspectives on its role in tumour progression, treatment resistance and PIKKing potential therapeutic targets.","The aggressive, invasive and treatment resistant nature of glioblastoma makes it one of the most lethal cancers in humans. Total surgical resection is difficult, and a combination of radiation and chemotherapy is used to treat the remaining invasive cells beyond the tumour border by inducing DNA damage and activating cell death pathways in glioblastoma cells. Unfortunately, recurrence is common and a major hurdle in treatment, often met with a more aggressive and treatment resistant tumour. A mechanism of resistance is the response of DNA repair pathways upon treatment-induced DNA damage, which enact cell-cycle arrest and repair of DNA damage that would otherwise cause cell death in tumour cells.",2021-05-31
34032024,The RagA and RagB proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis.,"RagA and RagB proteins are major components of the outer membrane of the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and, while recently suggested to represent a novel peptide uptake system, their full function is still under investigation. Herein, we (a) discuss the evidence that the rag locus contributes to P. gingivalis virulence; (b) provide insight to Rag protein potential biological function in macromolecular transport and other aspects of bacterial physiology; (c) address the host response to Rag proteins which are immunodominant and immunomodulatory; and (d) review the potential of Rag-focused therapeutic strategies for the control of periodontal diseases.",2021-06-08
34021735,Bifunctional Therapeutic Peptide Assembled Nanoparticles Exerting Improved Activities of Tumor Vessel Normalization and Immune Checkpoint Inhibition.,"The effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy is impaired by the dysfunctional vasculature of tumors. Created hypoxia zones and limited delivery of cytotoxic immune cells help to have immune resistance in tumor tissue. Structural and functional normalization of abnormal tumor vasculature provide vessels for more perfusion efficiency and drug delivery that result in alleviating the hypoxia in the tumor site and increasing infiltration of antitumor T cells. Taking advantage of peptide amphiphiles, herein, a novel peptide amphiphile nanoparticle composed of an antiangiogenic peptide (FSEC) and an immune checkpoint blocking peptide (<sup>D</sup> PPA) is designed and characterized. FSEC peptide is known to be involved in vessel normalization of tumors in vivo. <sup>D</sup> PPA is an inhibitory peptide of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway. The peptide amphiphile nanoparticle sets out to test whether simultaneous modulation of tumor vasculature and immune systems in the tumor microenvironment has a synergistic effect on tumor suppression. Increased intratumoral infiltration of immune cells following vascular normalization, and simultaneously blocking the immune checkpoint function of PD-L1 reactivates effective immune responses to the tumors. In summary, the current study provides a new perspective on the regulation of tumor vessel normalization and immunotherapy based on functional peptide nanoparticles as nanomedicine for improved therapeutic purposes.",2021-05-22
34019908,Novel small molecule inhibitor of Kpnβ1 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells.,"Karyopherin beta 1 (Kpnβ1) is a major nuclear import receptor that mediates the import of cellular cargoes into the nucleus. Recently it has been shown that Kpnβ1 is highly expressed in several cancers, and its inhibition by siRNA induces apoptotic cancer cell death, while having little effect on non-cancer cells. This study investigated the effect of a novel small molecule, Inhibitor of Nuclear Import-60 (INI-60), on cancer cell biology, as well as nuclear import activities associated with Kpnβ1, and cancer progression in vivo using cervical and oesophageal cancer cell lines. INI-60 treatment resulted in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and induced a G1/S cell cycle arrest, followed by cancer cell death via apoptosis. Non-cancer cells were minimally affected by INI-60 at concentrations that inhibited cancer cells. INI-60 treatment altered the localisation of Kpnβ1 and its cargoes, NFκB/p65, NFAT and AP-1, and the overexpression of Kpnβ1 reduced INI-60 cytotoxicity. INI-60 also inhibited KYSE 30 oesophageal cancer cell line growth in vivo. Taken together, these results show that INI-60 inhibits the nuclear import of Kpnβ1 cargoes and interferes with cancer cell biology. INI-60 presents as a potential therapeutic approach for cancers of different tissue origins and warrants further investigation as a novel anti-cancer agent.",2021-05-18
34017051,Using molecular dynamics simulations to prioritize and understand AI-generated cell penetrating peptides.,"Cell-penetrating peptides have important therapeutic applications in drug delivery, but the variety of known cell-penetrating peptides is still limited. With a promise to accelerate peptide development, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including deep generative models are currently in spotlight. Scientists, however, are often overwhelmed by an excessive number of unannotated sequences generated by AI and find it difficult to obtain insights to prioritize them for experimental validation. To avoid this pitfall, we leverage molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain mechanistic information to prioritize and understand AI-generated peptides. A mechanistic score of permeability is computed from five steered MD simulations starting from different initial structures predicted by homology modelling. To compensate for variability of predicted structures, the score is computed with sample variance penalization so that a peptide with consistent behaviour is highly evaluated. Our computational pipeline involving deep learning, homology modelling, MD simulations and synthesizability assessment generated 24 novel peptide sequences. The top-scoring peptide showed a consistent pattern of conformational change in all simulations regardless of initial structures. As a result of wet-lab-experiments, our peptide showed better permeability and weaker toxicity in comparison to a clinically used peptide, TAT. Our result demonstrates how MD simulations can support de novo peptide design by providing mechanistic information supplementing statistical inference.",2021-05-20
34013260,Retro Drug Design: From Target Properties to Molecular Structures.,"To generate drug molecules of desired properties with computational methods is the holy grail in pharmaceutical research. Here we describe an AI strategy, retro drug design, or RDD, to generate novel small molecule drugs from scratch to meet predefined requirements, including but not limited to biological activity against a drug target, and optimal range of physicochemical and ADMET properties. Traditional predictive models were first trained over experimental data for the target properties, using an atom typing based molecular descriptor system, ATP. Monte Carlo sampling algorithm was then utilized to find the solutions in the ATP space defined by the target properties, and the deep learning model of Seq2Seq was employed to decode molecular structures from the solutions. To test feasibility of the algorithm, we challenged RDD to generate novel drugs that can activate μ opioid receptor (MOR) and penetrate blood brain barrier (BBB). Starting from vectors of random numbers, RDD generated 180,000 chemical structures, of which 78% were chemically valid. About 42,000 (31%) of the valid structures fell into the property space defined by MOR activity and BBB permeability. Out of the 42,000 structures, only 267 chemicals were commercially available, indicating a high extent of novelty of the AI-generated compounds. We purchased and assayed 96 compounds, and 25 of which were found to be MOR agonists. These compounds also have excellent BBB scores. The results presented in this paper illustrate that RDD has potential to revolutionize the current drug discovery process and create novel structures with multiple desired properties, including biological functions and ADMET properties. Availability of an AI-enabled fast track in drug discovery is essential to cope with emergent public health threat, such as pandemic of COVID-19.",2021-05-12

34011533,"Pharmacokinetics, Disposition, and Biotransformation of [<sup>14</sup>C]Omecamtiv Mecarbil in Healthy Male Subjects after a Single Intravenous or Oral Dose.","Omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) is a novel cardiac myosin activator that is currently in clinical development for the treatment of heart failure. The absorption and disposition of [<sup>14</sup>C]OM (60 µCi) were studied after a single intravenous infusion (35 mg over 1 hour) or oral solution dose (35 mg) in 14 healthy male subjects. Mean recovery of the administered [<sup>14</sup>C]OM dose was 85.1% and 86.5% over 336 hours for the intravenous and oral routes, respectively. After intravenous dosing, 47.8% and 37.3% of the dose was recovered in urine and feces, respectively; after oral dosing, 48.6% and 38.0% was recovered in urine and feces, respectively. Unchanged OM accounted for a minor percentage of radioactivity in urine (mean 7.7% of dose) and feces (mean 4.1% of dose) across all subjects. The major metabolites recovered in urine and feces were M3 (decarbamoylation product) and sequential metabolite M4 (lactam of M3), which accounted for means of 26.5% and 11.6% of the administered dose, respectively. The CYP4 family of enzymes was primarily responsible for the formation of M3 based on in vitro studies. Other metabolic pathways accounted for 14.9% of the administered dose. In pooled plasma, OM, M3, and M4 accounted for 83.8%, 6.0%, and 3.3% of the total [<sup>14</sup>C]OM-related materials. No other plasma metabolites constituted more than 3% of the administered dose. The bioavailability for OM solution was 93.5% after rapid and extensive absorption. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study characterized the absorption and disposition of OM, a novel small molecule being developed for the treatment of heart failure. OM was primarily cleared through metabolism by the CYP4 family through oxidative cleavage of a terminal carbamate moiety that resembles hydrolysis.",2021-05-19
34011224,Robust classification-based molecular modelling of diverse chemical entities as potential SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors: theoretical justification in light of experimental evidences.,"COVID-19 is the most unanticipated incidence of 2020 affecting the human population worldwide. Currently, it is utmost important to produce novel small molecule anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs urgently that can save human lives globally. Based on the earlier SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection along with the general characters of coronaviral replication, a number of drug molecules have been proposed. However, one of the major limitations is the lack of experimental observations with different drug molecules. In this article, 70 diverse chemicals having experimental SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup>inhibitory activity were accounted for robust classification-based QSAR analysis statistically validated with 4 different methodologies to recognize the crucial structural features responsible for imparting the activity. Results obtained from all these methodologies supported and validated each other. Important observations obtained from these analyses were also justified with the ligand-bound crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup> enzyme. Our results suggest that molecules should contain a 2-oxopyrrolidine scaffold as well as a methylene (hydroxy) sulphonic acid warhead in proper orientation to achieve higher inhibitory potency against SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup>. Outcomes of our study may be able to design and discover highly effective SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors as potential anticoronaviral therapy to crusade against COVID-19.",2021-05-20
33998175,uPA-PAI-1 heteromerization promotes breast cancer progression by attracting tumorigenic neutrophils.,"High intratumoral levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) heteromers predict impaired survival and treatment response in early breast cancer. The pathogenetic role of this protein complex remains obscure. Here, we demonstrate that heteromerization of uPA and PAI-1 multiplies the potential of the single proteins to attract pro-tumorigenic neutrophils. To this end, tumor-released uPA-PAI-1 utilizes very low-density lipoprotein receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinases to initiate a pro-inflammatory program in perivascular macrophages. This enforces neutrophil trafficking to cancerous lesions and skews these immune cells toward a pro-tumorigenic phenotype, thus supporting tumor growth and metastasis. Blockade of uPA-PAI-1 heteromerization by a novel small-molecule inhibitor interfered with these events and effectively prevented tumor progression. Our findings identify a therapeutically targetable, hitherto unknown interplay between hemostasis and innate immunity that drives breast cancer progression. As a personalized immunotherapeutic strategy, blockade of uPA-PAI-1 heteromerization might be particularly beneficial for patients with highly aggressive uPA-PAI-1<sup>high</sup> tumors.",2021-05-16
33997269,Targeting glioblastoma using a novel peptide specific to a deglycosylated isoform of brevican.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadliest form of brain tumor and remains amongst the most difficult cancers to treat. Brevican (Bcan), a central nervous system (CNS)-specific extracellular matrix protein, is upregulated in high-grade glioma cells, including GBM. A Bcan isoform lacking most glycosylation, dg-Bcan, is found only in GBM tissues. Here, dg-Bcan is explored as a molecular target for GBM. In this study, we screened a d-peptide library to identify a small 8-amino acid dg-<b>B</b>can-<b>T</b>argeting <b>P</b>eptide (BTP) candidate, called BTP-7 that binds dg-Bcan with high affinity and specificity. BTP-7 is preferentially internalized by dg-Bcan-expressing patient-derived GBM cells. To demonstrate GBM targeting, we radiolabeled BTP-7 with <sup>18</sup>F, a radioisotope of fluorine, and found increased radiotracer accumulation in intracranial GBM established in mice using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. dg-Bcan is an attractive molecular target for GBM, and BTP-7 represents a promising lead candidate for further development into novel imaging agents and targeted therapeutics.",2021-01-20
33995091,Novel Small Molecule Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist S6 Stimulates Insulin Secretion From Rat Islets.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist-based therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus have attracted worldwide attention. However, there are challenges in the development of small molecule GLP-1R agonists owing to the complexity of ligand recognition and signal induction mechanisms. Here, we attained S6 using virtual screening and fluorescent imaging plate reader (FLIPR)-based calcium assays. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize S6, a novel small molecule GLP-1R agonist. Data from cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) indicated that S6 could bind potently with GLP-1R. Radioimmunoassay data showed that S6 potentiated insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and the insulinotropic effect was mediated by GLP-1R. Calcium imaging techniques suggested that S6 elevated the intracellular calcium concentration [(Ca<sup>2+</sup>)<sub>i</sub>] by activating GLP-1R. In patch-clamp experiments, we demonstrated that S6 inhibited voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channels in a GLP-1R-dependent fashion. Besides, S6 significantly prolonged action potential duration but had no effect on voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. In summary, these findings indicate that S6 stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion mainly by acting on GLP-1R, inhibiting Kv channels, increasing (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)<sub>i</sub>. This study will provide direction for the screening and development of novel small-molecule agents targeting GLP-1R in the future.",2021-04-29

33967793,The Tetramethylpyrazine Derivative Statmp-151: A Novel Small Molecule Stat3 Inhibitor With Promising Activity Against Breast Cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is overexpressed and hyperactivated in a variety of human tumours, including breast cancer, thus representing a promising target for breast cancer treatment. In the present study, we evaluated the activities of a novel Stat3 inhibitor named Statmp-151 in the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and the murine mammary carcinoma cell line 4T1. The <i>in vitro</i> results showed that Statmp-151 inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner and suppressed the phosphorylation of Stat3 in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry (FCM) assays revealed that Statmp-151 affected mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, Statmp-151 inhibited cell migration, as shown by analysis of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9. Finally, in a 4T1 tumour-bearing mouse model, intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg/day Statmp-151 significantly suppressed the growth of tumours without obvious toxicity. These results indicated that Statmp-151 might be a potential candidate for the treatment of breast cancer.",2021-04-15
33963664,"Discovery of novel SecA inhibitors against ""Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus"" through virtual screening and biological evaluation.","""Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus"" (Ca. L. asiaticus) is the causal agent of Huanglongbing disease of citrus and current study focuses on the discovery of novel small-molecule inhibitors against SecA protein of Ca. L. asiaticus. In this study, homologous modeling was used to construct the three-dimensional structure of SecA. Then, molecular docking-based virtual screening and two rounds of in vitro bacteriostatic experiments were utilized to identify novel small-molecule inhibitors of SecA. Encouragingly, 93 compounds were obtained and two of them (P684-2850, P684-3808) showed strong antimicrobial activities against Liberibacter crescens BT-1 in bacteriostatic experiments. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to explore the binding modes of the receptor-ligand complexes. Results in MD simulations showed that compound P684-3808 was relatively stable during simulation, while compound P684-2850 left the binding pocket. Compound P684-3808 might be suitable as a lead compound for further development of antimicrobial compounds against SecA of Ca. L. asiaticus.",2021-06-12
33960189,Microenvironment pH-Induced Selective Cell Death for Potential Cancer Therapy Using Nanofibrous Self-Assembly of a Peptide Amphiphile.,"Self-assembly of synthetic molecules has been drawing broad attention as a novel emerging approach in drug discovery. Here, we report selective cell death induced by a novel peptide amphiphile that self-assembles to form entangled nanofibers (hydrogel) based on intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>). We found that a palmitoylated hexapeptide (C<sub>16</sub>-VVAEEE) formed a hydrogel below pH 7. The formation of the nanofibrous self-assembly was responsive to a small pH change around pH 7. The cytotoxicity of C<sub>16</sub>-VVAEEE was correlated with pH<sub>i</sub> of cells. Microscope observation demonstrated the self-assembly of C<sub>16</sub>-VVAEEE inside HEK293 cells. <i>In vivo</i> experiments revealed that the transcutaneous administration of C<sub>16</sub>-VVAEEE showed remarkable anti-tumor activity. This study proposes that distinct microenvironment inside living cells can be used as a trigger for the intracellular self-assembly of a peptide amphiphile, which provide a new clue to drug discovery.",2021-05-07
33949282,Classical MD and metadynamics simulations on back-pocket binders of CDK2 and VEGFR2: a guidepost to design novel small-molecule dual inhibitors.,"Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) and Vascular-Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) are promising targets for the design of novel inhibitors in anticancer therapeutics. In a recent work, our group designed a set of potential dual inhibitors predicted to occupy an allosteric back pocket near the active site of both enzymes, but their dynamic and unbinding behavior was unclear. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) and metadynamics (meta-D) simulations to study two of these virtual candidates (herein called IQ2 and IQ3). Their binding mode was predicted to be similar to that observed in LQ5 and BAX, well-known back-pocket binders of CDK2 and VEGFR2, respectively, including H-bonding with critical residues such as Leu83/Cys113 and Asp145/Asp190 (but excepting H-bonding with Glu51/Glu111) in CDK2/VEGFR2, correspondingly. Likewise, while LQ5 and BAX unbound through the allosteric channel as expected for type-IIA inhibitors, IQ2 and IQ3 unbound via the ATP channel (except for CDK2-IQ2) as expected for type-I½A inhibitors. Interestingly, a C-C single/double bond difference between IQ2/IQ3, respectively, resulted associated with differences in the AS/T loop flexibility observed for CDK2. These insights will help developing scaffold modifications during an optimization stage, serving as a starting point to develop dual kinase inhibitors in challenging biological targets with a promising anticancer potential.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",2021-05-05
33921332,Identification of Vinyl Sulfone Derivatives as EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor: In Vitro and In Silico Studies.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), overexpressed in many types of cancer, has been proved as a high potential target for targeted cancer therapy due to its role in regulating proliferation and survival of cancer cells. In the present study, a series of designed vinyl sulfone derivatives was screened against EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) using in silico and in vitro studies. The molecular docking results suggested that, among 78 vinyl sulfones, there were eight compounds that could interact well with the EGFR-TK at the ATP-binding site. Afterwards, these screened compounds were tested for the inhibitory activity towards EGFR-TK using ADP-Glo™ kinase assay, and we found that only VF16 compound exhibited promising inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 7.85 ± 0.88 nM. In addition, VF16 showed a high cytotoxicity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 33.52 ± 2.57, 54.63 ± 0.09, and 30.38 ± 1.37 µM against the A431, A549, and H1975 cancer cell lines, respectively. From 500-ns MD simulation, the structural stability of VF16 in complex with EGFR-TK was quite stable, suggesting that this compound could be a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting EGFR-TK.",2021-04-12
33918370,Emerging Therapeutic Strategies to Overcome Drug Resistance in Multiple Myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell neoplasm that remains incurable and is ultimately fatal when patients acquire multi-drug resistance. Thus, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind drug resistance in multi-relapsed patients is critical for developing better strategies to extend their lifespan. Here, we review the understanding of resistance to the three key drug classes approved for multiple myeloma treatment: immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. We consider how the complex, heterogenous biology of multiple myeloma may influence the acquisition of drug resistance and reflect on the gaps in knowledge where additional research is needed to improve our treatment approaches. Fortunately, many agents are currently being evaluated preclinically and in clinical trials that have the potential to overcome or delay drug resistance, including next-generation immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors, novel small molecule drugs, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, antibody-drug conjugates, and bispecific antibodies. For each class, we discuss the potential of these strategies to overcome resistance through modifying agents within each class or new classes without cross-resistance to currently available drugs.",2021-04-02
33914520,Triaging of DNA-Encoded Library Selection Results by High-Throughput Resynthesis of DNA-Conjugate and Affinity Selection Mass Spectrometry.,"DNA encoded library (DEL) technology allows for rapid identification of novel small-molecule ligands and thus enables early-stage drug discovery. DEL technology is well-established, numerous cases of discovered hit molecules have been published, and the technology is widely employed throughout the pharmaceutical industry. Nonetheless, DEL selection results can be difficult to interpret, as library member enrichment may derive from not only desired products, but also DNA-conjugated byproducts and starting materials. Note that DELs are generally produced using split-and-pool combinatorial chemistry, and DNA-conjugated byproducts and starting materials cannot be removed from the library mixture. Herein, we describe a method for high-throughput parallel resynthesis of DNA-conjugated molecules such that byproducts, starting materials, and desired products are produced in a single pot, using the same chemical reactions and reagents as during library production. The low-complexity mixtures of DNA-conjugate are then assessed for protein binding by affinity selection mass spectrometry and the molecular weights of the binding ligands ascertained. This workflow is demonstrated to be a practical tool to triage and validate potential hits from DEL selection data.",2021-04-29
33909625,A novel small molecule LLL12B inhibits STAT3 signaling and sensitizes ovarian cancer cell to paclitaxel and cisplatin.,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths among American women. Platinum and taxane combination chemotherapy represents the first-line approach for ovarian cancer, but treatment success is often limited by chemoresistance. Therefore, it is necessary to find new drugs to sensitize ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy. Persistent activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling plays an important role in oncogenesis. Using a novel approach called advanced multiple ligand simultaneous docking (AMLSD), we developed a novel nonpeptide small molecule, LLL12B, which targets the STAT3 pathway. In this study, LLL12B inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation (tyrosine 705) and the expression of its downstream targets, which are associated with cancer cell proliferation and survival. We showed that LLL12B also inhibits cell viability, migration, and proliferation in human ovarian cancer cells. LLL12B combined with either paclitaxel or with cisplatin demonstrated synergistic inhibitory effects relative to monotherapy in inhibiting cell viability and LLL12B-paclitaxel or LLL12B-cisplatin combination exhibited greater inhibitory effects than cisplatin-paclitaxel combination in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, LLL12B-paclitaxel or LLL12B-cisplatin combination showed more significant in inhibiting cell migration and growth than monotherapy in ovarian cancer cells. In summary, our results support the novel small molecule LLL12B as a potent STAT3 inhibitor in human ovarian cancer cells and suggest that LLL12B in combination with the current front-line chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel may represent a promising approach for ovarian cancer therapy.",2021-04-28

Herein, we describe the medicinal chemistry optimization of a screening hit to yield novel small-molecule inhibitors of the β-catenin/BCL9 interaction. The best compound <b>30</b> can disrupt the β-catenin/BCL9 interaction with a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> of 3.6 μM in AlphaScreen competitive inhibition assays. Cell-based experiments revealed that <b>30</b> selectively disrupted the β-catenin/BCL9 PPI, while leaving the β-catenin/E-cadherin PPI unaffected, dose-dependently suppressed Wnt signaling transactivation, downregulated oncogenic Wnt target gene expression, and on-target selectively inhibited the growth of cancer cells harboring aberrant Wnt signaling. This compound with a new chemotype can serve as a lead compound for further optimization of inhibitors for β-catenin/BCL9 PPI.",2021-04-26
33902285,Discovery of Novel Small-Molecule Antiangiogenesis Agents to Treat Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness which is associated with excessive angiogenesis. Using the structure of wondonin marine natural products, we previously created a scaffold to develop a novel type of antiangiogenesis agent that possesses minimized cytotoxicity. To overcome its poor pharmaceutical properties, we further modified the structure. A new scaffold was derived in which the stereogenic carbon was changed to nitrogen and the 1,2,3-triazole ring was replaced by an alkyl chain. By comparing the bioactivity versus cytotoxicity, compound <b>31</b> was selected, which has improved aqueous solubility and an enhanced selectivity index. Mechanistically, <b>31</b> suppressed angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) expression induced by high glucose in retinal cells and exhibited <i>in vivo</i> antiangiogenic activity in choroidal neovascularization and oxygen-induced retinopathy mouse models. These results suggest the potential of <b>31</b> as a lead to develop antiangiogenic small-molecule drugs to treat diabetic retinopathy and as a chemical tool to elucidate new mechanisms of angiogenesis.",2021-04-26
33901805,A novel small-molecule fatty acid synthase inhibitor with antitumor activity by cell cycle arrest and cell division inhibition.,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN), the key enzyme in de novo lipogenesis, is an attractive therapeutic target for diseases characterized by excessive lipid accumulation. Many FASN inhibitors have failed in the clinical trial phase, largely because of poor solubility and safety. In this study, we generated a novel small-molecule FASN inhibitor by structure-based virtual screening. PFI09, the lead compound, is easy to synthesize, and inhibits the lipid synthesis in OP9 mammalian cell line and Caenorhabditis elegans as well as the proliferation of several cancer cell lines via the blockade of FASN. Mechanistic investigations show that PFI09 induces S-phase arrest, cell division reduction and apoptosis. We also develop a chemically stable analog of PFI09, MFI03, which reduces the proliferation of PC3 tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, without toxicity to mice. In summary, our data suggest that MFI03 is an effective FASN inhibitor and a promising antineoplastic drug candidate.",2021-04-20

33886255,Strategies to Combat Multi-Drug Resistance in Tuberculosis.,"""<i>Drug resistance is an unavoidable consequence of the use of drugs; however, the emergence of multi-drug resistance can be managed by accurate diagnosis and tailor-made regimens.</i>""Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), is one of the most paramount health perils that has emerged in the 21st century. The global increase in drug-resistant strains of various bacterial pathogens prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop a priority list of AMR pathogens. <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>), an acid-fast bacillus that causes tuberculosis (TB), merits being one of the highest priority pathogens on this list since drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) accounts for ∼29% of deaths attributable to AMR. In recent years, funded collaborative efforts of researchers from academia, not-for-profit virtual R&D organizations and industry have resulted in the continuous growth of the TB drug discovery and development pipeline. This has so far led to the accelerated regulatory approval of bedaquiline and delamanid for the treatment of DR-TB. However, despite the availability of drug regimes, the current cure rate for multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) treatment regimens is 50% and 30%, respectively. It is to be noted that these regimens are administered over a long duration and have a serious side effect profile. Coupled with poor patient adherence, this has led to further acquisition of drug resistance and treatment failure. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new TB drugs with novel mechanism of actions (MoAs) and associated regimens.This Account recapitulates drug resistance in TB, existing challenges in addressing DR-TB, new drugs and regimens in development, and potential ways to treat DR-TB. We highlight our research aimed at identifying novel small molecule leads and associated targets against TB toward contributing to the global TB drug discovery and development pipeline. Our work mainly involves screening of various small molecule chemical libraries in phenotypic whole-cell based assays to identify hits for medicinal chemistry optimization, with attendant deconvolution of the MoA. We discuss the identification of small molecule chemotypes active against <i>Mtb</i> and subsequent structure-activity relationships (SAR) and MoA deconvolution studies. This is followed by a discussion on a chemical series identified by whole-cell cross-screening against <i>Mtb</i>, for which MoA deconvolution studies revealed a pathway that explained the lack of in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of TB and reiterated the importance of selecting an appropriate growth medium during phenotypic screening. We also discuss our efforts on drug repositioning toward addressing DR-TB. In the concluding section, we preview some promising future directions and the challenges inherent in advancing the drug pipeline to address DR-TB.",2021-04-22
33870816,Novel Peptide NT/K-CFY Derived from Kringle Structure of Neurotrypsin Inhibits Neovascularization.,"<b>Purpose</b>: To assess the anti-neovascularization effect of a novel peptide NT/K-CFY derived from the kringle domain of neurotrypsin.<b>Materials and Methods</b>: Cell migration, lumen formation and cell proliferation assays were performed to determine the anti-neovascularization effect of NT/K-CFY in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) models were established to assess the anti-angiogenic role of NT/K-CFY <i>in vivo</i>. The retinal expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) was examined by western blot and real-time PCR in OIR model.<b>Results</b>: The <i>in vitro</i> results showed that NT/K-CFY effectively and safely decreased VEGF-induced cell migration, cell proliferation and tube formation in HUVECs. In addition, NT/K-CFY showed certain efficacy in angiogenesis inhibition in chicken embryos and oxygen-treated mouse pups. Moreover, the CFY peptide also improved retinal blood perfusion and reversed the abnormal expression of VEGF and PEDF in OIR mouse model.<b>Conclusion</b>: NT/K-CFY peptide strongly inhibits neovascularization <i>in vitro and vivo</i>. This novel peptide may become a promising therapeutic agent for ocular angiogenesis-related diseases.",2021-04-19
33869275,A Nanomule Peptide Carrier Delivers siRNA Across the Intact Blood-Brain Barrier to Attenuate Ischemic Stroke.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) hinders the distribution of therapeutics intended for treatment of neuroinflammation (NI) of the central nervous system. A twelve-amino acid peptide that transcytoses the BBB, termed MTfp, was chemically conjugated to siRNA to create a novel peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate (POC), directed to downregulate NOX4, a gene thought responsible for oxidative stress in ischemic stroke. The MTfp-NOX4 POC has the ability to cross the intact BBB and knockdown NOX4 expression in the brain. Following induction of ischemic stroke, animals pretreated with the POC exhibited significantly smaller infarcts; accompanied by increased protection against neurological deterioration and improved recovery. The data demonstrates that the MTfp can act as a nanomule to facilitate BBB transcytosis of siRNAs; where the NOX-4 specific siRNA moiety can elicit effective therapeutic knockdown of a gene responsible for oxidative stress in the central nervous system. This study is the first to conclusively demonstrate both siRNA-carrier delivery and therapeutic efficacy in any CNS disease model where the BBB remains intact and thus offers new avenues for potential treatments of oxidative stress underlying neuroinflammation in a variety of neuropathologies that are currently refractory to existing therapies.",2021-03-26
33868212,"A Novel Small Molecule, LCG-N25, Inhibits Oral Streptococcal Biofilm.","Dental caries is a chronic oral infectious disease caused by cariogenic biofilm adhered on the tooth surface. Our previous study demonstrated that a repurposed natural compound napabucasin (NAP) showed good antimicrobial activity against oral streptococcal biofilms. The current study designed a novel small molecule, namely LCG-N25, using NAP as a lead compound, and aimed to investigate its potential as an antimicrobial agent in the control of dental caries. LCG-N25 was designed and synthesized with reference to the structure of NAP. The minimal inhibitory concentrations and the minimal bactericidal concentrations of LCG-N25 against <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, <i>Streptococcus sanguinis</i>, and <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i> were evaluated by microdilution method. The antimicrobial activity of LCG-N25 was further evaluated by crystal violet staining, colony forming units counting, biofilm metabolism assay, dead/live fluorescent staining, and scanning electron microscopy. The effect of LCG-N25 on the extracellular polysaccharides of biofilms was determined by both anthrone-sulfuric acid method and fluorescent staining. The microbial composition of streptococcal biofilms after LCG-N25 treatment was further visualized and quantified by fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization. Besides, the cytotoxicity of LCG-N25 was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and repeated exposure of <i>S. mutans</i> to LCG-N25 treatment was performed to assess if this novel compound could induce drug resistance of this cariogenic bacterium. We found that LCG-N25 exhibited a good antibacterial activity, low-cytotoxicity, and did not induce drug resistance of cariogenic <i>S. mutans</i>. These findings suggest that LCG-N25 may represent a promising antimicrobial agent that can be used as an adjuvant to the management of dental caries.",2021-03-29
33862514,Identification and optimization of 3-bromo-N'-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-4-methylbenzohydrazide derivatives as mTOR inhibitors that induce autophagic cell death and apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer.,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a worse prognosis than other types of breast cancer due to its special biological behavior and clinicopathological characteristics. TNBC cell proliferation and progression to metastasis can be suppressed by inducing cytostatic autophagy. mTOR is closely related to autophagy and is involved in protein synthesis, nutrient metabolism and activating mTOR promotes tumor growth and metastasis. In this paper, we adopted the strategy of structure simplification, aimed to look for novel small-molecule inhibitors of mTOR by pharmacophore-based virtual screening and biological activity determination. We found a lead compound with 3-bromo-N'-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-4-methylbenzohydrazide for rational drug design and structural modification, then studied its structure-activity relationship. After that, compound 7c with the best TNBC cells inhibitory activities and superior mTOR enzyme inhibitory activity was obtained. In addition, we found that compound 7c could induce autophagic cell death and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. In conclusion, these findings provide new clues for our 3-bromo-N'-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-4-methylbenzohydrazide derivatives, which are expected to become drug candidates for the treatment of TNBC in the future.",2021-04-03
33860211,Target-Driven Design of a Coumarinyl Chalcone Scaffold Based Novel EF2 Kinase Inhibitor Suppresses Breast Cancer Growth <i>In Vivo</i>.,"Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF-2K) is an unusual alpha kinase involved in protein synthesis through phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2). eEF-2K is highly overexpressed in breast cancer, and its activity is associated with significantly shortened patient survival and proven to be a potential molecular target in breast cancer. The crystal structure of eEF-2K remains unknown, and there is no potent, safe, and effective inhibitor available for clinical applications. We designed and synthesized several generations of potential inhibitors. The effect of the inhibitors at the binding pocket of eEF-2K was analyzed after developing a 3D target model by using a domain of another α-kinase called myosin heavy-chain kinase A (MHCKA) that closely resembles eEF-2K. <i>In silico</i> studies showed that compounds with a coumarin-chalcone core have high predicted binding affinities for eEF-2K. Using <i>in vitro</i> studies in highly aggressive and invasive (MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231, and BT20) and noninvazive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells, we identified a lead compound that was highly effective in inhibiting eEF-2K activity at submicromolar concentrations and at inhibiting cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis with no toxicity in normal breast epithelial cells. <i>In vivo</i> systemic administration of the lead compound encapsulated in single lipid-based liposomal nanoparticles twice a week significantly suppressed growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors in orthotopic breast cancer models in nude mice with no observed toxicity. In conclusion, our study provides a highly potent and <i>in vivo</i> effective novel small-molecule eEF-2K inhibitor that may be used as a molecularly targeted therapy breast cancer or other eEF-2K-dependent tumors.",2021-03-30
33859747,A novel small-molecule PROTAC selectively promotes tau clearance to improve cognitive functions in Alzheimer-like models.,"Intracellular accumulation of tau is a hallmark pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD) and the related tauopathies, thus targeting tau could be promising for drug development. Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) is a novel drug discovery strategy for selective protein degradation from within cells. <b>Methods:</b> A novel small-molecule PROTAC, named as C004019 with a molecular mass of 1,035.29 dalton, was designed to simultaneously recruite tau and E3-ligase (Vhl) and thus to selectively enhance ubiquitination and proteolysis of tau proteins. Western blotting, immunofluoresence and immunohistochemical staining were employed to verify the effects of C004019 in cell models (HEK293 and SH-SY5Y) and mouse models (hTau-transgenic and 3xTg-AD), respectively. The cognitive capacity of the mice was assessed by a suite of behavior experiments. Electrophysiology and Golgi staining were used to evaluate the synaptic plasticity. <b>Results:</b> C004019 induced a robust tau clearance <i>via</i> promoting its ubiquitination-proteasome-dependent proteolysis in HEK293 cells with stable or transient overexpression of human tau (hTau), and in SH-SY5Y that constitutively overexpress hTau. Furthermore, intracerebral ventricular infusion of C004019 induced a robust tau clearance <i>in vivo</i>. Most importantly, both single-dose and multiple-doses (once per 6 days for a total 5 times) subcutaneous administration of C004019 remarkably decreased tau levels in the brains of wild-type, hTau-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice with improvement of synaptic and cognitive functions. <b>Conclusions:</b> The PROTAC (C004019) created in the current study can selectively and efficiently promote tau clearance both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, which provides a promising drug candidate for AD and the related tauopathies.",2021-03-11
33851101,Targeting SLP76:ITK interaction separates GVHD from GVL in allo-HSCT.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative therapy for hematological malignancies, due to graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity mediated by alloreactive donor T cells. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is also mediated by these cells. Here, we assessed the effect of attenuating TCR-mediated SLP76:ITK interaction in GVL vs. GVHD effects after allo-HSCT. CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> donor T cells from mice expressing a Y145F mutation in SLP-76 did not cause GVHD but preserved GVL effects against B-ALL cells. SLP76Y145FKI CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> donor T cells also showed less inflammatory cytokine production and migration to GVHD target organs. We developed a novel peptide to specifically inhibit SLP76:ITK interactions, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and ERK, decreased cytokine production in human T cells, and separation of GVHD from GVL effects. Altogether, our data suggest that inhibiting SLP76:ITK interaction could be a therapeutic strategy to separate GVHD from GVL effects after allo-HSCT treatment.",2021-03-11
33850183,In silico screening identifies a novel small molecule inhibitor that counteracts PARP inhibitor resistance in ovarian cancer.,"Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are promising targeted therapy for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) with BRCA mutations or defective homologous recombination (HR) repair. However, reversion of BRCA mutation and restoration of HR repair in EOC lead to PARP inhibitor resistance and reduced clinical efficacy of PARP inhibitors. We have previously shown that triapine, a small molecule inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), impaired HR repair and sensitized HR repair-proficient EOC to PARP inhibitors. In this study, we performed in silico screening of small molecule libraries to identify novel compounds that bind to the triapine-binding pocket on the R2 subunit of RNR and inhibit RNR in EOC cells. Following experimental validation of selected top-ranking in silico hits for inhibition of dNTP and DNA synthesis, we identified, DB4, a putative RNR pocket-binding inhibitor markedly abrogated HR repair and sensitized BRCA-wild-type EOC cells to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the combination of DB4 and olaparib deterred the progression of BRCA-wild type EOC xenografts and significantly prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Herein we report the discovery of a putative small molecule inhibitor of RNR and HR repair for combination with PARP inhibitors to treat PARP inhibitor-resistant and HR repair-proficient EOC.",2021-04-13
33845047,"Design of novel peptide inhibitors against the conserved bacterial transcription terminator, Rho.","The transcription terminator Rho regulates many physiological processes in bacteria, such as antibiotic sensitivity, DNA repair, RNA remodeling, and so forth, and hence, is a potential antimicrobial target, which is unexplored. The bacteriophage P4 capsid protein, Psu, moonlights as a natural Rho antagonist. Here, we report the design of novel peptides based on the C-terminal region of Psu using phenotypic screening methods. The resultant 38-mer peptides, in addition to containing mutagenized Psu sequences, also contained plasmid sequences, fused to their C termini. Expression of these peptides inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and specifically inhibited Rho-dependent termination in vivo. Peptides 16 and 33 exhibited the best Rho-inhibitory properties in vivo. Direct high-affinity binding of these two peptides to Rho also inhibited the latter's RNA-dependent ATPase and transcription termination functions in vitro. These two peptides remained functional even if eight to ten amino acids were deleted from their C termini. In silico modeling and genetic and biochemical evidence revealed that these two peptides bind to the primary RNA-binding site of the Rho hexamer near its subunit interfaces. In addition, the gene expression profiles of these peptides and Psu overlapped significantly. These peptides also inhibited the growth of Mycobacteria and inhibited the activities of Rho proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Xanthomonas, Vibrio cholerae, and Salmonella enterica. Our results showed that these novel anti-Rho peptides mimic the Rho-inhibition function of the ∼42-kDa dimeric bacteriophage P4 capsid protein, Psu. We conclude that these peptides and their C-terminal deletion derivatives could provide a basis on which to design novel antimicrobial peptides.",2021-05-15
33844495,Novel Peptide-Calix[4]arene Conjugate Inhibits Aβ Aggregation and Rescues Neurons from Aβ's Oligomers Cytotoxicity <i>In Vitro</i>.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition affecting people in the elderly. Targeting aggregation of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) is considered a promising approach for the therapeutic treatment of the disease. Peptide based inhibitors of β-amyloid fibrillation are emerging as safe drug candidates as well as interesting compounds for early diagnosis of AD. Peptide conjugation via covalent bond with functional moieties enables the resultant hybrid system to acquire desired functions. Here we report the synthesis, the structural characterization, and the Aβ<sub>42</sub> interaction of a <i>p</i>-amino-calix[4]arene derivative bearing a GPGKLVFF peptide pendant at the lower rim. We demonstrate that the <i>p</i>-amino-calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF conjugate alters the Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregation pathways by preventing Aβ<sub>42</sub>'s conformational transition from random coil to β-sheet with concomitant changes of the aggregation kinetic profile as evidenced by circular dichroism (CD), thioflavin T (ThT), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, respectively. High resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) confirmed a direct interaction of the <i>p</i>-amino-calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF conjugate with Aβ<sub>42</sub> monomer which provided insight into a possible working mechanism, whereas the alteration of the Aβ<sub>42</sub>'s fibrillary architecture, by the calix-peptide conjugate, was further validated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Finally, the herein proposed compound was shown to be effective against Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers' toxicity in differentiated neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y.",2021-04-12

33830736,Self-Assembling Nano-Globular Peptide from Human Lactoferrin Acts as a Systemic Enhancer of Bone Regeneration: A Novel Peptide for Orthopedic Application.,"A technology for systemic and repeated administration of osteogenic factors for orthopedic use is an unmet medical need. Lactoferrin (∼80 kDa), present in milk, is known to support bone growth. We discovered a lactoferrin-mimetic peptide, LP2 (an 18-residue fragment from the N-terminus of the N-lobe of human lactoferrin), which self-assembles into a nano-globular assembly with a β-sheet structure in an aqueous environment. LP2 is non-hemolytic and non-cytotoxic against human red blood cells and 3T3 fibroblasts, respectively, and appreciably stable in the human serum. LP2 through the bone morphogenetic protein-dependent mechanism stimulates osteoblast differentiation more potently than the full-length protein as well as the osteoblastic production of osteoprotegerin (an anti-osteoclastogenic factor). Consequently, daily subcutaneous administration of LP2 to rats and rabbits with osteotomy resulted in faster bone healing and stimulated bone formation in rats with a low bone mass more potently than that with teriparatide, the standard-of-care osteogenic peptide for osteoporosis. LP2 has skeletal bioavailability and is safe at the 15× osteogenic dose. Thus, LP2 is a novel peptide that can be administered systemically for the medical management of hard-to-heal fractures.",2021-04-08
33825492,miR34a: a novel small molecule regulator with a big role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.,"Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by pulmonary inflammation leading to impaired alveolarization and vascular dysregulation, have an increased risk of abnormal lung function in infancy, childhood, and adulthood. These include a heightened risk of pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory illnesses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to disrupt normal lung development and function by interrupting alveolarization and vascularization resulting in the development of BPD. Among the various miRs involved in BPD, miR34a has been shown to have a significant role in BPD pathogenesis. Targeting miR34a or its downstream targets may be a promising therapeutic intervention for BPD. In this review, we summarize the data on cellular arrest, proliferation, differentiation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis impacted by miR34a in the development of BPD pulmonary phenotypes while predicting the future perspective of miR34a in BPD.",2021-04-07

33809638,Enzyme-Digested Peptides Derived from <i>Lates calcarifer</i> Enhance Wound Healing after Surgical Incision in a Murine Model.,"Surgical wounds are common injuries of skin and tissues and usually become a clinical problem. Until now, various synthetic and natural peptides have been widely explored as potential drug candidates for wound healing. Inhibition of the TNF-α signaling pathway and promotion of angiogenesis are suggested to be involved in their effects. Angiogenesis at the wound site is one of the essential requisites for rapid healing. In the present study, a novel peptide extract derived from the natural source <i>Lates calcarifer</i>, commonly known as sea bass or barramundi, was evaluated for its wound healing property. The specific acidic and enzymatic approaches were employed for producing sea bass extract containing small size peptides (molecular weight ranging from 1 kD to 5 kD). The cytotoxicity of the extract was examined in HaCaT and NIH3T3. After this, the effects of enzyme digested peptide extracts of sea bass on wound healing in mice were investigated. The peptide extracts (660 and 1320 mg/kg/day) and control protein (1320 mg/kg/day) was orally given to the wounded mice, respectively, for 12 days. The surgical method was improved by implanting a silicone ring at the wound site. The ring avoided the contracting effect in murine wounds, making it more closely related to a clinical condition. The results showed promising improvement at the wound site in mice. Sea bass peptide extracts accelerated the wound healing process and enhanced the microvessel formation at the wound site. The remarkable effects of this novel sea bass peptide extract in healing traumatic injuries revealed a new option for developing wound management.",2021-03-16
33807987,Cathepsin S Cleaves BAX as a Novel and Therapeutically Important Regulatory Mechanism for Apoptosis.,"Certain lysosomal cathepsin proteins have come into focus as being good candidates for therapeutic targeting, based on them being over-expressed in a variety of cancers and based on their regulation of the apoptotic pathway. Here, we report novel findings that highlight the ability of cathepsin S expression to be up-regulated under Paclitaxel-stimulatory conditions in kidney cell lines and it being able to cleave the apoptotic p21 BAX protein in intact cells and in vitro. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that this effect can be abrogated in vitro and in mammalian cells under conditions that utilize dominant-inhibitory cathepsin S expression, cathepsin S expression-knockdown and through the activity of a novel peptide inhibitor, CS-PEP1. Moreover, we report a unique role for cathepsin S in that it can cleave a polyubiquitinated-BAX protein intermediate and is a step that may contribute to down-regulating post-translationally-modified levels of BAX protein. Finally, CS-PEP1 may possess promising activity as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic against chemotherapeutic-resistant Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma kidney cancer cells and for combined uses with therapeutics such as Paclitaxel.",2021-03-05
33806560,Small Immunomodulatory Molecules as Potential Therapeutics in Experimental Murine Models of Acute Lung Injury (ALI)/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).,"Acute lung injury (ALI) or its most advanced form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe inflammatory pulmonary process triggered by a variety of insults including sepsis, viral or bacterial pneumonia, and mechanical ventilator-induced trauma. Currently, there are no effective therapies available for ARDS. We have recently reported that a novel small molecule AVR-25 derived from chitin molecule (a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine) showed anti-inflammatory effects in the lungs. The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of two chitin-derived compounds, AVR-25 and AVR-48, in multiple mouse models of ALI/ARDS. We further determined the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the lead compound AVR-48 in rats.",2021-03-04
33805945,A 2-Benzylmalonate Derivative as STAT3 Inhibitor Suppresses Tumor Growth in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Upregulating β-TrCP E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.,"The aberrant activation of a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) restrains type I interferon (IFN) α/β-induced antiviral responses and is associated with the development of cancer. Designing specific STAT3 inhibitors will thus provide new options for use as IFN therapy. Herein, we identified a novel small molecule, dimethyl 2-(4-(2-(methyl(phenyl(p-tolyl)methyl)amino)ethoxy)benzyl)malonate (CIB-6), which can inhibit the IFN-α-induced interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) luciferase reporter (IC<sub>50</sub> value = 6.4 μM) and potentiate the antiproliferative effect of IFN-α in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. CIB-6 was found to bind to the STAT3 Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, thereby selectively inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation without affecting Janus kinases and STAT1/2. CIB-6 also inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells by inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, CIB-6 reduced the expression of β-catenin (an EMT key protein) via upregulating β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) and curbed nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) activation through restricting the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) via STAT3 inhibition. Treatment with CIB-6 significantly retarded tumor growth in nude mice with SK-HEP-1 xenografts. In addition, clinical sample analysis revealed that lower β-TrCP and higher β-catenin expression could affect the median survival time of HCC patients. Our findings suggest that CIB-6 could be a new therapeutic strategy for HCC therapy through STAT3-mediated β-TrCP/β-catenin/NF-κB axis.",2021-03-25
33805784,Moscatilin Inhibits Metastatic Behavior of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells: A Crucial Role of uPA Suppression via Akt/NF-κB-Dependent Pathway.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently shows early invasion into blood vessels as well as intrahepatic metastasis. Innovations of novel small-molecule agents to block HCC invasion and subsequent metastasis are urgently needed. Moscatilin is a bibenzyl derivative extracted from the stems of a traditional Chinese medicine, orchid <i>Dendrobium loddigesii</i>. Although moscatilin has been reported to suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth, the anti-metastatic property of moscatilin has not been elucidated. The present results revealed that moscatilin inhibited metastatic behavior of HCC cells without cytotoxic fashion in highly invasive human HCC cell lines. Furthermore, moscatilin significantly suppressed the activity of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), but not matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Interestingly, moscatilin-suppressed uPA activity was through down-regulation the protein level of uPA, and did not impair the uPA receptor and uPA inhibitory molecule (PAI-1) expressions. Meanwhile, the mRNA expression of uPA was inhibited via moscatilin in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the expression of phosphorylated Akt, rather than ERK1/2, was inhibited by moscatilin treatment. The expression of phosphor-IκBα, and -p65, as well as κB-luciferase activity were also repressed after moscatilin treatment. Transfection of constitutively active Akt (Myr-Akt) obviously restored the moscatilin-inhibited the activation of NF-κB and uPA, and cancer invasion in HCC cells. Taken together, these results suggest that moscatilin impedes HCC invasion and uPA expression through the Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway. Moscatilin might serve as a potential anti-metastatic agent against the disease progression of human HCC.",2021-03-13

33788544,Novel Peptide-Based Magnetic Nanoparticle for Mesenchymal Circulating Tumor Cells Detection.,"The monitoring of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has recently served as a promising approach for assessing prognosis and evaluating cancer treatment. We have already developed a CTCs enrichment platform by EpCAM recognition peptide-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (EP@MNPs). However, considering heterogeneous CTCs generated through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mesenchymal CTCs would be missed with this method. Notably, N-cadherin, overexpressed on mesenchymal CTCs, can facilitate the migration of cancer cells. Hence, we screened a novel peptide targeting N-cadherin, NP, and developed a new CTCs isolation approach via NP@MNPs to complement EpCAM methods' deficiencies. NP@MNPs had a high capture efficiency (about 85%) of mesenchymal CTCs from spiked human blood. Subsequently, CTCs were captured and sequenced at the single-cell level via NP@MNPs and EP@MNPs, RNA profiles of which showed that epithelial and mesenchymal subgroups could be distinguished. Here, a novel CTCs isolation platform laid the foundation for mesenchymal CTCs isolation and subsequent molecular analysis.",2021-03-31
33786626,Fluorofenidone attenuates paraquat‑induced pulmonary fibrosis by regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and autophagy.,"Paraquat (PQ) is a widely used herbicide that is severely toxic to humans and animals. Pulmonary fibrosis is a disorder that can result from PQ poisoning. Fluorofenidone (AKF‑PD) is a novel small molecule pyridone drug with a widespread and clear anti‑organ fibrosis effect; however, its mechanism of action on PQ poisoning‑induced pulmonary fibrosis is not clear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of AKF‑PD on PQ poisoning‑induced pulmonary fibrosis. Human alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) and Sprague‑Dawley rats were treated with AKF‑PD in the presence or absence of PQ. Hematoxylin‑eosin and Masson staining were used to observe the morphological changes in lung tissue. Cell Counting Kit‑8 and lactate dehydrogenase assays were used to evaluate the viability of HPAEpiC cells. ELISA was used to detect inflammatory factors and the collagen content. Finally, the effects of AKF‑PD on pulmonary fibrosis, as well as the underlying mechanisms, were evaluated via western blotting, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence analysis. AKF‑PD effectively alleviated PQ‑induced pulmonary fibrosis and reduced the expression of oxidative stress and inflammatory factors. Moreover, AKF‑PD treatment effectively inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and upregulated autophagy. Overall, these findings suggested that AKF‑PD can alleviate PQ‑induced inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and by upregulating autophagy.",2021-03-31

Peptides from milk proteins is gaining popularity in various therapeutics including human cancer. The study was aimed to investigate the anti-cancerous and anti-inflammatory properties of camel whey protein hydrolysates (CWPHs). CWPHs were generated at three temperatures (30 ℃, 37 ℃, and 45 ℃), two hydrolysis timepoints (120 and 360 min) and with three different enzyme concentrations (0.5, 1 and 2 %). CWPHs demonstrated an increase in anti-inflammatory effect between 732.50 (P-6.1) and 3779.16 (P-2.1) µg Dicolfenac Sodium Equivalent (DSE)/mg protein. CWPHs (P-4.3 & 5.2) inhibited growth of human colon carcinoma cells (HCT116) with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 231 and 221 μg/ml, respectively. P-4.3 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and modulated the expression of Cdk1, p-Cdk1, Cyclin B1, p-histone H3, p21 and p53. Docking of two peptides (AHLEQVLLR and ALPNIDPPTVER) from CWPHs (P-4.3) identified Polo like kinase 1 as a potential target, which strongly supports our in vitro data and provides an encouraging insight into developing a novel peptide-based anticancer formulation. These results suggest that the active component, CWPHs (P-4.3), can be further studied and modeled to form a small molecule anti-cancerous therapy.",2021-03-29
33757145,"A Novel Peptide Derived from Ginger Induces Apoptosis through the Modulation of p53, BAX, and BCL2 Expression in Leukemic Cell Lines.","Despite the efficacy of chemotherapy, the adverse effects of chemotherapeutic drugs are considered a limitation of leukemia treatment. Therefore, a chemotherapy drug with minimal side effects is currently needed. One interesting molecule for this purpose is a bioactive peptide isolated from plants since it has less toxicity to normal cells. In this study, we extracted protein from the <i>Zingiber officinale</i> rhizome and performed purification to acquire the peptide fraction with the highest cytotoxicity using ultrafiltration, reverse-phase chromatography, and off-gel fractionation to get the peptide fraction that contained the highest cytotoxicity. Finally, a novel antileukemic peptide, P2 (sequence: RALGWSCL), was identified from the highest cytotoxicity fraction. The P2 peptide reduced the cell viability of NB4, MOLT4, and Raji cell lines without an effect on the normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The combination of P2 and daunorubicin significantly decreased leukemic cell viability when compared to treatment with either P2 or daunorubicin alone. In addition, leukemic cells treated with P2 demonstrated increased apoptosis and upregulation of caspase 3, 8, and 9 gene expression. Moreover, we also examined the effects of P2 on p53, which is the key regulator of apoptosis. Our results showed that treatment of leukemic cells with P2 led to the upregulation of p53 and Bcl-2-associated X protein, and the downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2, indicating that p53 is involved in apoptosis induction by P2. The results of this study are anticipated to be useful for the development of P2 as an alternative drug for the treatment of leukemia.",2021-03-23
33752129,Metabolomic analysis of a selective ABCA1 inducer in obesogenic challenge provides a rationale for therapeutic development.,"Therapeutic agents with novel mechanisms of action are needed to combat the growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related metabolic syndromes. Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists possess preclinical efficacy yet produce side effects due to excessive lipogenesis. Anticipating that many beneficial and detrimental effects of LXR agonists are mediated by ABCA1 and SREPB1c expression, respectively, we hypothesized that a phenotypic optimization strategy prioritizing selective ABCA1 induction would identify an efficacious lead compound with an improved side effect profile over existing LXRβ agonists.",2021-03-19
33747186,Protective effects of peptide FK18 against neuro-excitotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.,"Excitotoxic neuronal injury is associated with numerous acute and chronic neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. Neuroprotection is a direct and effective therapeutic approach, with small-molecule bioactive peptides displaying certain advantages, including high membrane permeability, low immunogenicity and convenient synthesis and modification. FK18 is a novel peptide derived from basic fibroblast growth factor, which is a protein with neuroprotective effects. The present study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of FK18 against excitotoxic injury. For this purpose, cell viability was determined by the MTS assay, cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and the TUNEL assay; expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, proapoptotic protein Bax and caspase-3 as well as the phosphorylation of Akt and Erk was estimated by western blotting. The results of the present study demonstrated that FK18 effectively increased the viability of, and attenuated glutamate-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, FK18 significantly increased Akt phosphorylation and decreased Erk phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. FK18 also increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decreased the level of cleaved-caspase-3 in SY5Y cells, which was reversed by the Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002, but not by the Erk pathway inhibitor U0126. The findings of the present study suggested that FK18 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the inhibition of neuronal cell death in multiple neurological diseases involving excitotoxicity.",2021-03-01
33741272,A novel small molecule approach for the treatment of propionic and methylmalonic acidemias.,"Propionic Acidemia (PA) and Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) are inborn errors of metabolism affecting the catabolism of valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine and odd-chain fatty acids. These are multi-organ disorders caused by the enzymatic deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) or methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), resulting in the accumulation of propionyl-coenzyme A (P-CoA) and methylmalonyl-CoA (M-CoA in MMA only). Primary metabolites of these CoA esters include 2-methylcitric acid (MCA), propionyl-carnitine (C3), and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, which are detectable in both PA and MMA, and methylmalonic acid, which is detectable in MMA patients only (Chapman et al., 2012). We deployed liver cell-based models that utilized PA and MMA patient-derived primary hepatocytes to validate a small molecule therapy for PA and MMA patients. The small molecule, HST5040, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of P-CoA, M-CoA (in MMA) and the disease-relevant biomarkers C3, MCA, and methylmalonic acid (in MMA). A putative working model of how HST5040 reduces the P-CoA and its derived metabolites involves the conversion of HST5040 to HST5040-CoA driving the redistribution of free and conjugated CoA pools, resulting in the differential reduction of the aberrantly high P-CoA and M-CoA. The reduction of P-CoA and M-CoA, either by slowing production (due to increased demands on the free CoA (CoASH) pool) or enhancing clearance (to replenish the CoASH pool), results in a net decrease in the CoA-derived metabolites (C3, MCA and MMA (MMA only)). A Phase 2 study in PA and MMA patients will be initiated in the United States.",2021-03-10
33738062,Discovery of Novel Small-Molecule FAK Activators Promoting Mucosal Healing.,"Gastrointestinal mucosal wounds are common to patients injured by factors as diverse as drugs, inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcers, and necrotizing enterocolitis. However, although many drugs are used to ameliorate injurious factors, there is no drug available to actually stimulate mucosal wound healing. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, induces epithelial sheet migration and wound healing, making FAK a potential pharmacological target in this regard. In our previous research, we found a lead compound with drug-like properties, ZINC40099027, which promotes FAK phosphorylation, inducing mucosal healing in murine models. Herein we describe the design and optimization of a small library of novel FAK activators based on ZINC40099027 and their applications toward human intestinal epithelial wound closure and mouse ulcer healing.",2021-02-16

33721543,"Spexin alleviates hypertension, hyperuricaemia, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in high fructose diet induced metabolic syndrome in rats via enhancing PPAR-ɣ and AMPK and inhibiting IL-6 and TNF-α.","Spexin is a novel peptide implicated in obesity and energy homeostasis. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of spexin on blood pressure, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia in rats with metabolic syndrome (MS) induced by high-fructose diet (HFD) and the possible underlying mechanism. Forty adult male rats were randomly assigned into four equal groups; Control, Spexin, HFD and HFD + spexin. Induction of the MS with HFD was associated with increased body mass index, elevated blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin, uric acid, advanced glycation end products and insulin resistance, interlekin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha together with dyslipidemia, low-serum spexin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma (PPAR-ɣ) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Spexin attenuated MS-induced deleterious effects which can be attributed to activation of PPAR-ɣ and AMPK as well as inhibiting inflammation. These findings indicate that spexin could be a beneficial complementary agent for metabolic syndrome treatment.",2021-03-15

33717824,Vaccinomics approach for scheming potential epitope-based peptide vaccine by targeting l-protein of Marburg virus.,"Marburg virus is one of the world's most threatening diseases, causing extreme hemorrhagic fever, with a death rate of up to 90%. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently not authorized any treatments or vaccinations for the hindrance and post-exposure of the Marburg virus. In the present study, the vaccinomics methodology was adopted to design a potential novel peptide vaccine against the Marburg virus, targeting RNA-directed RNA polymerase (l). A total of 48 l-proteins from diverse variants of the Marburg virus were collected from the NCBI GenBank server and used to classify the best antigenic protein leading to predict equally T and B-cell epitopes. Initially, the top 26 epitopes were evaluated for the attraction with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II alleles. Finally, four prospective central epitopes NLSDLTFLI, FRYEFTRHF, YRLRNSTAL, and YRVRNVQTL were carefully chosen. Among these, FRYEFTRHF and YRVRNVQTL peptides showed 100% conservancy. Though YRLRNSTAL showed 95.74% conservancy, it demonstrated the highest combined score as T cell epitope (2.5461) and population coverage of 94.42% among the whole world population. The epitope was found non-allergenic, and docking interactions with human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) also verified. Finally, in vivo analysis of the recommended peptides might contribute to the advancement of an efficient and exclusively prevalent vaccine that would be an active route to impede the virus spreading.",2021-03-06
33715594,Structure-based design of small molecule and peptide inhibitors for selective targeting of ROCK1: an integrative computational approach.,"Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK1) regulates cell contraction, morphology, and motility by phosphorylating its downstream targets. ROCK1 is a proven target for many pathological conditions like cancer, atherosclerosis, glaucoma, neuro-degeneration, etc. Though many kinase inhibitors are available, there is a dearth of studies on repurposing approved drugs and novel peptide inhibitors that could potentially target ROCK1. Hence, in this study, an extensive integration of open-source pipelines was employed to probe the potential inhibitors (ligand/peptide) for targeting ROCK1. To start with, a systematic enrichment analysis was performed to delineate the most optimal ROCK1 crystal structure that can be harnessed for drug design. A comparative analysis of conformational flexibility between monomeric and dimeric forms was also performed to prioritize the optimal assembly for structural studies. Subsequently, Virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs in Drugbank was performed using POAP pipeline. Further, the top hits were probed for binding affinity, crucial interaction fingerprints, and complex stability during MD simulation. In parallel, a combinatorial tetrapeptide library was also virtually screened against ROCK1 using the PepVis pipeline. Following which, all these shortlisted inhibitors (compounds/peptides) were subjected to Kinomerun analysis to infer other potential kinase targets. Finally, Polydatin and conivaptan were prioritized as the most potential repurposable inhibitors, and WWWF, WWVW as potential inhibitory peptides for targeting ROCK1. The prioritized inhibitors are highly promising for use in therapeutics, as these are resultants of the multilevel stringent filtration process. The computational strategies implemented in this study could potentially serve as a scaffold towards selective inhibitor design for other kinases.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",2021-03-10
33689880,A novel peptide identified from skin secretions of Bombina maxima possesses LPS-neutralizing activity.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major pathogenic factor in endotoxin shock or sepsis. Most antibiotics have little clinical anti-endotoxin activity, but some antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been shown to be effective in blocking LPS. We identified a novel peptide from the skin secretions of Bombina maxima (B. _maxima) by challenging the skin of frogs with an LPS solution. Peptide 2 has an amino acid sequence of LVGKLLKGAVGDVCGLLPIC. Peptide 2 possesses low hemolytic activity, low cytotoxicity against RAW 264.7 cells, and strong anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, peptide 2 plays an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). A biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay indicated that peptide 2 binds to LPS with strong affinity and that this interaction has an affinity constant (K<sub>D</sub>) value of 1.05 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M. A survival study showed that peptide 2 possesses potent LPS-neutralizing activity to protect LPS-treated mice from death. In conclusion, we have identified a potent peptide with LPS neutralizing activity, which lays a foundation for future research and development.",2021-03-06

33678513,"Disease-modifying effects of edasalonexent, an NF-κB inhibitor, in young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Results of the MoveDMD phase 2 and open label extension trial.","Chronic activation of NF-κB is a key driver of muscle degeneration and suppression of muscle regeneration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Edasalonexent (CAT-1004) is an orally-administered novel small molecule that covalently links two bioactive compounds (salicylic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) that inhibit NF-κB. This placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept phase 2 study with open-label extension in boys ≥4-<8 years old with any dystrophin mutation examined the effect of edasalonexent (67 or 100 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo or off-treatment control. Endpoints were safety/tolerability, change from baseline in MRI T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time of lower leg muscles and functional assessment, as well as pharmacodynamics and biomarkers. Treatment was well-tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild, and most commonly of the gastrointestinal system (primarily diarrhea). There were no serious adverse events in the edasalonexent groups. Edasalonexent 100 mg/kg was associated with slowing of disease progression and preservation of muscle function compared to an off-treatment control period, with decrease in levels of NF-κB-regulated genes and improvements in biomarkers of muscle health and inflammation. These results support investigating edasalonexent in future trials and have informed the design of the edasalonexent phase 3 clinical trial in boys with Duchenne.",2021-02-04
33672199,Novel Small Molecule Hsp90/Cdc37 Interface Inhibitors Indirectly Target K-Ras-Signaling.,"The ATP-competitive inhibitors of Hsp90 have been tested predominantly in kinase addicted cancers; however, they have had limited success. A mechanistic connection between Hsp90 and oncogenic K-Ras is not known. Here, we show that K-Ras selectivity is enabled by the loss of the K-Ras membrane nanocluster modulator galectin-3 downstream of the Hsp90 client HIF-1α. This mechanism suggests a higher drug sensitivity in the context of KRAS mutant, HIF-1α-high and/or Gal3-high cancer cells, such as those found, in particular, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The low toxicity of conglobatin further indicates a beneficial on-target toxicity profile for Hsp90/Cdc37 interface inhibitors. We therefore computationally screened >7 M compounds, and identified four novel small molecules with activities of 4 μM-44 μM in vitro. All of the compounds were K-Ras selective, and potently decreased the Hsp90 client protein levels without inducing the heat shock response. Moreover, they all inhibited the 2D proliferation of breast, pancreatic, and lung cancer cell lines. The most active compounds from each scaffold, furthermore, significantly blocked 3D spheroids and the growth of K-Ras-dependent microtumors. We foresee new opportunities for improved Hsp90/Cdc37 interface inhibitors in cancer and other aging-associated diseases.",2021-02-23
33671256,Identification and Characterization of Mortaparib<sup>Plus</sup>-A Novel Triazole Derivative That Targets Mortalin-p53 Interaction and Inhibits Cancer-Cell Proliferation by Wild-Type p53-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms.,"p53 has an essential role in suppressing the carcinogenesis process by inducing cell cycle arrest/apoptosis/senescence. Mortalin/GRP75 is a member of the Hsp70 protein family that binds to p53 causing its sequestration in the cell cytoplasm. Hence, p53 cannot translocate to the nucleus to execute its canonical tumour suppression function as a transcription factor. Abrogation of mortalin-p53 interaction and subsequent reactivation of p53's tumour suppression function has been anticipated as a possible approach in developing a novel cancer therapeutic drug candidate. A chemical library was screened in a high-content screening system to identify potential mortalin-p53 interaction disruptors. By four rounds of visual assays for mortalin and p53, we identified a novel synthetic small-molecule triazole derivative (4-[(1E)-2-(2-phenylindol-3-yl)-1-azavinyl]-1,2,4-triazole, henceforth named Mortaparib<sup>Plus</sup>). Its activities were validated using multiple bioinformatics and experimental approaches in colorectal cancer cells possessing either wild-type (HCT116) or mutant (DLD-1) p53. Bioinformatics and computational analyses predicted the ability of Mortaparib<sup>Plus</sup> to competitively prevent the interaction of mortalin with p53 as it interacted with the p53 binding site of mortalin. Immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated the abrogation of mortalin-p53 complex formation in Mortaparib<sup>Plus</sup>-treated cells that showed growth arrest and apoptosis mediated by activation of p21<sup>WAF1</sup>, or BAX and PUMA signalling, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mortaparib<sup>Plus</sup>-induced cytotoxicity to cancer cells is mediated by multiple mechanisms that included the inhibition of PARP1, up-regulation of p73, and also the down-regulation of mortalin and CARF proteins that play critical roles in carcinogenesis. Mortaparib<sup>Plus</sup> is a novel multimodal candidate anticancer drug that warrants further experimental and clinical attention.",2021-02-17
33665380,Efficient refolding and functional characterization of <i>Pf</i>AMA1(DI+DII) expressed in <i>E. coli</i>.,"Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is a surface protein of <i>Plasmodium sp.</i> that plays a crucial role in forming moving junction (MJ) during the invasion of human red blood cells. The obligatory presence of AMA1 in the parasite lifecycle designates this protein as a potential vaccine candidate and an essential target for the development of novel peptide or protein therapeutics. However, due to multiple cysteine residues in the protein sequence, attaining the native fold with correct disulfide linkages during the refolding process after expression in bacteria has remained challenging for years. Although several approaches to obtain the refolded protein from bacterial expression have been reported previously, achieving high yield during refolding and proper functional validation of the expressed protein was lacking. We report here an improved method of refolding to obtain higher quantity of refolded protein. We have also validated the refolded protein's functional activity by evaluating the expressed AMA1 protein binding with a known inhibitory peptide, rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2), using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).",2021-02-22
33650467,Discovery of novel heterocyclic amide-based inhibitors: an integrative <i>in-silico</i> approach to targeting soluble epoxide hydrolase.,"Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is considered as an emerging druggable target to reduce blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity, and decrease inflammation. Despite the availability of different classes of sEH small molecule inhibitors for the potential treatment of hypertension, only a few candidates have reached clinical trials, making the optimal control of blood pressure presently unattainable. This necessity motivated us to explore a series of novel quinazoline-4(3<i>H</i>)-one and 4,6-disubstituted pyridin-2(1<i>H</i>)-one derivatives targeting sEH enzyme. Herein, comprehensive computational investigations were performed to probe the inhibition efficacy of these potent compounds in terms of inhibitor-enzyme interactions against sEH. In this study, the 39 in-house with a focused library comprising 39 in-house synthesized compounds were selected. The structure-based pharmacophore modeling was developed based on the crystal structure of sEH with its co-crystallized biologically active inhibitor. The generated hypotheses were applied for virtual screening-based PHASE fitness scores. Docking-based virtual screening workflows were used to generate lead compounds using HTVS, SP and XP based GLIDE G-score values. The candidate leads were filtered using ADMET pharmacological and physicochemical properties screening. A 100-ns of molecular dynamics simulations with Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) were performed to explore the binding affinities of the considered compounds. Our study identified four best candidates from quinazoline-4(3H)-one derivatives, which indicated that a quinazolinone ring serves as a suitable scaffold to develop novel small molecule sEH inhibitors.",2021-03-02
33649860,Peptidomics analysis revealed that a novel peptide VMP‑19 protects against Ang II‑induced injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a vital pathological change in hypertension, which is mainly caused by apoptosis and oxidative stress injury of vascular endothelial cells. Peptidomics is a method for the direct analysis of small bioactive peptides in various biological samples using liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry (MS)/MS. Given the advantages of the low molecular weight, optimum targeting and easy access to cells, peptides have attracted extensive attention in the field of drug research. However, to the best of our knowledge, little is currently known regarding the role of peptides in vascular endothelial injury. In order to investigate the peptides involved in vascular endothelial protection, MS was used to analyze the peptide profiles in the supernatant of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by Ang II. The results revealed that 211 peptides were identified, of which six were upregulated and 13 were downregulated when compared with the control group. Subsequently, the present study analyzed the physical and chemical properties and biological functions of identified peptides by bioinformatics, and successfully screened a peptide (LLQDSVDFSLADAINTEFK) named VMP‑19 that could alleviate the apoptosis and oxidative stress injury of HUVECs induced by Ang II. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to use peptidomics to analyze the peptide profiles of supernatant secreted by HUVECs, and revealed that the novel peptide VMP‑19 could protect HUVECs from apoptosis and oxidative stress injury. The results of the present study could provide novel insights into treatment strategies for hypertension.",2021-03-02

There are no effective drugs for successful M. abscessus pulmonary infection therapy, and existing drug regimens recommended by the British or the American Thoracic Societies are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, novel antibacterial drugs are urgently needed to contain this global threat. The current anti-M. abscessus small-molecule drug development process can be enhanced by two parallel strategies-discovery of compounds from new chemical classes and commercial drug repurposing. This review focuses on recent advances in the finding of novel small-molecule agents, and more particularly focuses on the activity, mode of action and structure-activity relationship of promising inhibitors from five different chemical classes-benzimidazoles, indole-2-carboxamides, benzothiazoles, 4-piperidinoles, and oxazolidionones. We further discuss some other interesting small molecules, such as thiacetazone derivatives and benzoboroxoles, that are in the early stages of drug development, and summarize current knowledge about the efficacy of repurposable drugs, such as rifabutin, tedizolid, bedaquiline, and others.

NNMT is a metabolic enzyme that is correlated with tumour progression and metastasis. 5MQ is a small molecule inhibitor of NNMT. 0.1-500 μM of 5MQ was tested on the HeLa epithelial cervical cancer cell line. Cell viability was assessed with the MTT test. <i>TWIST, ZEB1, SERPIN1, SIRT1, CD16,</i> mRNA and various protein expression levels were analysed with Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western Blotting, respectively. 5MQ significantly inhibited HeLa cell proliferation in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Increased cell shrinkage, loss of cellular adhesions and apoptotic bodies were observed in HeLa cells after 5MQ treatment. Following treatment with 5MQ, <i>ZEB1, SIRT1, CD16</i> mRNA levels were increased while <i>TWIST</i> and <i>SERPIN1</i> mRNA levels were reduced. Expressions of oncogenic proteins phospho-Akt and SIRT1 were decreased. 5MQ can effectively inhibit HeLa cell proliferation without apparently affecting HEK-293 cell proliferation.IMPACT STATEMENT<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> NNMT is a cytosolic enzyme involved in tumour progression, metastasis and treatment resistance. It was overexpressed in many human malignancies. 5-amino-1-methylquinolinium (5MQ) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of NNMT that has shown promising results in the treatment of obesity and in senescent muscle regeneration. 5MQ has not been tested on the HeLa cervical cancer cell line, previously.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> In this study, 5MQ was tested on the HeLa cervical cancer cell line for the first time and the molecular changes associated with 5MQ treatment were analysed. 5MQ demonstrated significant anti-proliferative activity on HeLa cells, which displayed morphological signs of apoptosis. Treatment of HeLa cells with 5MQ led to an increase in <i>ZEB1, SIRT1</i> mRNA while <i>TWIST</i> mRNA was decreased. Phospho-Akt and Sirtuin1 protein expressions were decreased.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> 5MQ can effectively inhibit HeLa cell proliferation without apparently affecting HEK-293 cell proliferation. 5MQ treatment was associated with a decrease in the expression of phospho-Akt and Sirtuin1 proteins, both of which have been reported to maintain tumour progression. 5MQ can further be investigated and modified for anti-cancer therapy.",2021-03-01

To address the limitations of existing therapies targeting <i>EGFR</i>-mutated NSCLC, mobocertinib (TAK-788), a novel irreversible EGFR TKI, was specifically designed to potently inhibit oncogenic variants containing activating <i>EGFR</i>ex20ins mutations with selectivity over wild-type EGFR. The <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> activity of mobocertinib was evaluated in engineered and patient-derived models harboring diverse <i>EGFR</i>ex20ins mutations. Mobocertinib inhibited viability of various EGFRex20ins-driven cell lines more potently than approved EGFR TKIs and demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> antitumor efficacy in patient-derived xenografts and murine orthotopic models. These findings support the ongoing clinical development of mobocertinib for the treatment of <i>EGFR</i>ex20ins-mutated NSCLC. SIGNIFICANCE: No oral EGFR-targeted therapies are approved for <i>EGFR</i> exon 20 insertion (<i>EGFR</i>ex20ins) mutation-driven NSCLC. Mobocertinib is a novel small-molecule EGFR inhibitor specifically designed to target EGFRex20ins mutants. Preclinical data reported here support the clinical development of mobocertinib in patients with NSCLC with <i>EGFR</i> exon 20 insertion mutations.<i>See related commentary by Pacheco, p. 1617</i>.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1601</i>.",2021-02-25
33621039,A Novel Peptide-Equipped Exosomes Platform for Delivery of Antisense Oligonucleotides.,"Exosomes are natural delivery vehicles because of their original feature such as low immunogenicity, excellent biocompatibility, and migration capability. Engineering exosomes with appropriate ligands are effective approaches to improve the low cellular uptake efficiency of exosomes. However, current strategies face considerable challenges due to the tedious and labor-intensive operational process. Here, we designed a novel peptides-equipped exosomes platform which can be assembled under convenient and mild reaction condition. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) was conjugated on HepG2 cells-derived exosomes surface which can not only enhance the penetrating capacity of exosomes but also assist exosomes in loading antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The cellular uptake mechanism was investigated and we compared the difference between natural exosomes and modified exosomes. The resulting nanosystem demonstrated a preferential tropism for cells that are parented to their source tumor cells and could remarkably increase the cellular delivery of G3139 with efficient downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. This work developed a rapid strategy for intracellular delivery of nucleic acids, thus providing more possibilities toward personalized cancer medicine.",2021-02-23

At a subinhibitory concentration (4 μg/ml), ZY-214-4 had no effect on the growth of <i>S. aureus</i> strains and also showed no cytotoxicity in human normal bronchial epithelial cells (Bease-2B). The results of a semi-quantitative biofilm test showed that ZY-214-4 prevented <i>S. aureus</i> biofilm formation, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. ZY-214-4 significantly suppressed the production of polysaccharide intercellular adhesion and prevented cell aggregation, and also inhibited the mRNA expression of <i>icaA</i> and other biofilm-related genes (<i>eno</i>, <i>clfA/B</i>, <i>fnbB</i>, <i>fib</i>, <i>ebpS</i>, <i>psm</i>α, and <i>psm</i>β) in clinical <i>S. aureus</i> isolates. Thus, at a subinhibitory concentration, ZY-214-4 inhibits biofilm formation by preventing cell aggregation, highlighting its clinical potential for preventing or treating <i>S. aureus</i> infections.",2021-02-03
33611140,Peptide-targeted dendrimeric prodrugs of 5-aminolevulinic acid: A novel approach towards enhanced accumulation of protoporphyrin IX for photodynamic therapy.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising approach for the targeted treatment of cancer and various other human disorders. An effective, clinically approved approach in PDT involves the administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to generate elevated levels of the natural photosensitiser protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The development of prodrugs of ALA is of considerable interest as a means to enhance the efficiency and cell selectivity of PpIX accumulation for PDT applications. In this work a novel peptide-targeted dendrimeric prodrug of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 13 was synthesised which displays nine copies of ALA on a core structure that is linked to a homing peptide for targeted delivery to a specific cancer cell type. The synthesis was accomplished effectively via a flexible, modular solid phase and solution phase route, using a combination of solid phase peptide synthesis and copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. The prodrug system shows a sustained and enhanced production of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the MDA-MB-231 cell line that over-expresses the epidernal growth factor receptor (EGFR+) in comparison to equimolar ALA and the corresponding non-targeted ALA dendrimer (nine copies of ALA). This study provides a proof of concept for the development of a new generation of prodrugs for ALA-based photodynamic therapy that can deliver an enhanced ALA payload to specific tissue types.",2021-01-28
33595876,A novel peptide isolated from garlic shows anticancer effect against leukemic cell lines via interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins.,"Leukemia is a group of cancer caused by the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Efforts geared toward effective therapeutic strategies with minimal side effects are underway. Peptides derived from natural resources have recently gained special attention as alternative chemotherapeutic agents due to their minimal adverse effects. In the present study, the aim was to isolate peptides from garlic (Allium sativum) and investigate their anticancer activity against leukemic cell lines. The protein extract of A. sativum was pepsin-digested to obtain protein hydrolysate followed by sequential purification methods. A novel anticancer peptide, VKLRSLLCS (VS-9), was identified and characterized by mass spectrometric analysis. The peptide was demonstrated to significantly inhibit the cell proliferation of MOLT-4 and K562 leukemic cell lines while exhibiting minimal inhibition against normal PBMC. Particularly, VS-9 could induce apoptosis and upregulate mRNA levels of caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and Bax while downregulating Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w. Molecular docking of VS-9 with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family suggested that VS-9 could bind the binding groove of the BH3 domain on target proteins. Protein-peptide interaction analysis by affinity chromatography and LC-MS/MS further showed that VS-9 could bind Bcl-2 proteins. Results suggest VS-9 as a potential garlic-derived novel anticancer peptide possessing apoptosis-inducing properties against leukemic cell lines via anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family.",2021-03-01
33594070,Fast acting allosteric phosphofructokinase inhibitors block trypanosome glycolysis and cure acute African trypanosomiasis in mice.,"The parasitic protist Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of Human African Trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. The parasite enters the blood via the bite of the tsetse fly where it is wholly reliant on glycolysis for the production of ATP. Glycolytic enzymes have been regarded as challenging drug targets because of their highly conserved active sites and phosphorylated substrates. We describe the development of novel small molecule allosteric inhibitors of trypanosome phosphofructokinase (PFK) that block the glycolytic pathway resulting in very fast parasite kill times with no inhibition of human PFKs. The compounds cross the blood brain barrier and single day oral dosing cures parasitaemia in a stage 1 animal model of human African trypanosomiasis. This study demonstrates that it is possible to target glycolysis and additionally shows how differences in allosteric mechanisms may allow the development of species-specific inhibitors to tackle a range of proliferative or infectious diseases.",2021-02-16
33588180,Discovery and structural optimization of 3-O-β-chacotriosyl oleanane-type triterpenoids as potent entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections.,"Currently, SARS-CoV-2 virus is an emerging pathogen that has posed a serious threat to public health worldwide. However, no agents have been approved to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections to date, underscoring the great need for effective and practical therapies for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. We reported that a focused screen of OA saponins identified 3-O-β-chacotriosyl OA benzyl ester 2 as a novel small molecule inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 virus entry, via binding to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein (S). We performed structure-activity relationship profiling of 2 and discovered C-17-COOH of OA was an important modification site that improved both inhibitor potency toward SARS-CoV-2 and selectivity index. Then optimization from hit to lead resulted in a potent fusion inhibitor 12f displaying strong inhibition against infectious SARS-CoV-2 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.97 μM in vitro. Mechanism studies confirmed that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry of 12f was mediated by the direct interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit to block membrane fusion. These 3-O-β-chacotriosyl OA amide saponins are suitable for further optimization as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors with the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections.",2021-02-08
33586590,A dose escalation study of RO6870810/TEN-10 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.,"Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins can drive carcinogenesis and therapy resistance. RO6870810 (RO) is a novel, small-molecule BET inhibitor. We conducted a study in 32 patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia and hypomethylating agent-refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (NCT02308761). Pharmacodynamic assessments showed decreases in CD11b in peripheral blood mononuclear cells at RO concentrations above 120 ng/mL. Treatment emergent adverse events were generally mild and the most frequent were fatigue, injection site reactions, diarrhea, decreased appetite and nausea. There were no treatment-related deaths. Potential drug-related dose limiting toxicities included decreased appetite, congestive cardiac failure, hypertension, fatigue, increased conjugated bilirubin and increased gamma glutamyltransferase. One AML patient achieved complete remission after withdrawal from study. Eleven AML patients experienced SD. For AML, the median OS was 72.0 days. For MDS, two patients experienced SD. Further development of RO as monotherapy was discontinued due to lack of efficacy, but combinations with other agents are under consideration.",2021-02-13
33584686,"Targeting Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase in Cancer Models Using the Novel Small Molecule Inhibitor NTRC 3883-0.","Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is a key regulator of immune suppression by catalyzing the oxidation of L-tryptophan. IDO1 expression has been related to poor prognosis in several cancers and to resistance to checkpoint immunotherapies. We describe the characterization of a novel small molecule IDO1 inhibitor, NTRC 3883-0, in a panel of biochemical and cell-based assays, and various cancer models. NTRC 3883-0 released the inhibitory effect of IDO1 on CD8-positive T cell proliferation in co-cultures of IDO1-overexpressing cells with healthy donor lymphocytes, demonstrating its immune modulatory activity. In a syngeneic mouse model using IDO1-overexpressing B16F10 melanoma cells, NTRC 3883-0 effectively counteracted the IDO1-induced modulation of L-tryptophan and L-kynurenine levels, demonstrating its <i>in vivo</i> target modulation. Finally, we studied the expression and activity of IDO1 in primary cell cultures established from the malignant ascites of ovarian cancer patients. In these cultures, IDO1 expression was induced upon stimulation with IFNγ, and its activity could be inhibited by NTRC 3883-0. Based on these results, we propose the use of ascites cell-based functional assays for future patient stratification. Our results are discussed in light of the recent discontinuation of clinical trials of more advanced IDO1 inhibitors and the reconsideration of IDO1 as a valid drug target.",2021-01-28
33582407,P53-independent partial restoration of the p53 pathway in tumors with mutated p53 through ATF4 transcriptional modulation by ERK1/2 and CDK9.,"A long-term goal in the cancer-field has been to develop strategies for treating p53-mutated tumors. A novel small-molecule, PG3-Oc, restores p53 pathway-signaling in tumor cells with mutant-p53, independently of p53/p73. PG3-Oc partially upregulates the p53-transcriptome (13.7% of public p53 target-gene dataset; 15.2% of in-house dataset) and p53-proteome (18%, HT29; 16%, HCT116-p53<sup>-/-</sup>). Bioinformatic analysis indicates critical p53-effectors of growth-arrest (p21), apoptosis (PUMA, DR5, Noxa), autophagy (DRAM1), and metastasis-suppression (NDRG1) are induced by PG3-Oc. ERK1/2- and CDK9-kinases are required to upregulate ATF4 by PG3-Oc which restores p53 transcriptomic-targets in cells without functional-p53. PG3-Oc represses MYC (ATF4-independent), and upregulates PUMA (ATF4-dependent) in mediating cell death. With largely nonoverlapping transcriptomes, induced-ATF4 restores p53 transcriptomic targets in drug-treated cells including functionally important mediators such as PUMA and DR5. Our results demonstrate novel p53-independent drug-induced molecular reprogramming involving ERK1/2, CDK9, and ATF4 to restore upregulation of p53 effector genes required for cell death and tumor suppression.",2021-02-11
33573254,Computational Design of Macrocyclic Binders of S100B(ββ): Novel Peptide Theranostics.,"S100B(ββ) proteins are a family of multifunctional proteins that are present in several tissues and regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. Their altered expression levels have been associated with several human diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory disorders and neurodegenerative conditions, and hence are of interest as a therapeutic target and a biomarker. Small molecule inhibitors of S100B(ββ) have achieved limited success. Guided by the wealth of available experimental structures of S100B(ββ) in complex with diverse peptides from various protein interacting partners, we combine comparative structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations to design a series of peptides and their analogues (stapled) as S100B(ββ) binders. The stapled peptides were subject to in silico mutagenesis experiments, resulting in optimized analogues that are predicted to bind to S100B(ββ) with high affinity, and were also modified with imaging agents to serve as diagnostic tools. These stapled peptides can serve as theranostics, which can be used to not only diagnose the levels of S100B(ββ) but also to disrupt the interactions of S100B(ββ) with partner proteins which drive disease progression, thus serving as novel therapeutics.",2021-01-30
33569006,Rational Design of A Novel Small-Molecule HIV-1 Inactivator Targeting Both gp120 and gp41 of HIV-1.,"Virus inactivator can inactivate cell-free virions without relying on their replication cycle, potentially reducing the impact of viral infection on cells. Previously, we successfully constructed a HIV-1 protein inactivator, 2DLT, by conjugating the D1D2 region of CD4 to the fusion inhibitor T1144 via a 35-amino acid linker. Therefore, it targets both the CD4 binding site in gp120 and NHR region in gp41. Considering that small-molecule agents have the advantages of fast production, low cost, good stability, and oral availability, we herein report the design of a new small-molecule HIV-1 inactivator, FD028, by conjugating FD016 (an analog of NBD-556, a gp120-CD4 binding inhibitor) with FD017 (an analog of 11d, an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor). The results showed that FD028 inactivated cell-free virions at a moderate nanomolar concentration by targeting both HIV-1 gp120 and gp41. Moreover, FD028 has broad-spectrum inhibition and inactivation activity against HIV-1 resistant strains and primary isolates of different subtypes without significant cytotoxicity. Therefore, FD028 has potential for further development as an HIV-1 inactivator-based therapeutic.",2021-01-25
33562512,CD200:CD200R Interactions and Their Importance in Immunoregulation.,"The molecule CD200, described many years ago as a naturally occurring immunomodulatory agent, capable of regulating inflammation and transplant rejection, has attracted additional interest over the past years with the realization that it may also serve as an important marker for progressive malignancy. A large body of evidence also supports the hypothesis that this molecule can contribute to immunoregulation of, among other diseases, infection, autoimmune disease and allergy. New data have also come to light to characterize the receptors for CD200 (CD200R) and their potential mechanism(s) of action at the biochemical level, as well as the description of a novel natural antagonist of CD200, lacking the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of the full-length molecule. Significant controversies exist concerning the relative importance of CD200 as a ligand for all reported CD200Rs. Nevertheless, some progress has been made in the identification of the structural constraints determining the interaction between CD200 and CD200R, and this information has in turn proved of use in developing novel small molecule agonists/antagonists of the interaction. The review below highlights many of these newer findings, and attempts to place them in the broad context of our understanding of the role of CD200-CD200R interactions in a variety of human diseases.",2021-02-05

33548989,Effective treatment of anlotinib in giant delayed pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma: a case report and literature review.,"Tumor relapse and pulmonary metastasis, especially unresectable lesions, are the major cause of poor prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma. Anlotinib, a novel small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been proved to have desirable anti-tumor effects via blocking VEGFR2 and PDGFRβ phosphorylation in several tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer and soft tissue sarcoma. In this study, we presented a case of giant delayed pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma which was effectively treated by anlotinib. CT scan of this patient showed a giant neoplasm with the size of 1,366 cm3 in the left lung, clinically diagnosed as pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma. Due to refusing to chemotherapy and not eligible for surgery of the giant neoplasm, anlotinib was recommended. As a result, the tumor volume decreased more than 82% during 24-week anlotinib administration, from 1,366 to 247 cm3. Unfortunately, disease progression was observed at 27-week. Although argon-helium cryoablation (AHC) was performed followed by apatinib administration, the patient was dead in 16 weeks after disease progression. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival since anlotinib administration of this patient was 27 weeks and 43 weeks, respectively. The toxicity included hypertension, fatigue and hand-foot skin syndrome in grade 1-2, which were controllable and well tolerated. Meanwhile, immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of VEGFR2 and PDGFRβ was decreased significantly and the whole exon sequencing revealed that c-MYC was duplicated, which was potentially associated with anlotinib resistance. Anlotinib had promising anti-tumor efficiency in the treatment of delayed pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma. However, the potential mechanism of anlotinib resistance and the subsequent therapy after resistance were still challengeable and needed further investigation.",2021-01-29
33530327,Analyzing Kinase Similarity in Small Molecule and Protein Structural Space to Explore the Limits of Multi-Target Screening.,"While selective inhibition is one of the key assets for a small molecule drug, many diseases can only be tackled by simultaneous inhibition of several proteins. An example where achieving selectivity is especially challenging are ligands targeting human kinases. This difficulty arises from the high structural conservation of the kinase ATP binding sites, the area targeted by most inhibitors. We investigated the possibility to identify novel small molecule ligands with pre-defined binding profiles for a series of kinase targets and anti-targets by in silico docking. The candidate ligands originating from these calculations were assayed to determine their experimental binding profiles. Compared to previous studies, the acquired hit rates were low in this specific setup, which aimed at not only selecting multi-target kinase ligands, but also designing out binding to anti-targets. Specifically, only a single profiled substance could be verified as a sub-micromolar, dual-specific EGFR/ErbB2 ligand that indeed avoided its selected anti-target BRAF. We subsequently re-analyzed our target choice and in silico strategy based on these findings, with a particular emphasis on the hit rates that can be expected from a given target combination. To that end, we supplemented the structure-based docking calculations with bioinformatic considerations of binding pocket sequence and structure similarity as well as ligand-centric comparisons of kinases. Taken together, our results provide a multi-faceted picture of how pocket space can determine the success of docking in multi-target drug discovery efforts.",2021-01-26
33516994,A human β-casein-derived peptide BCCY-1 modulates the innate immune response.,"In this study, we report a novel peptide corresponding to the sequence of human β-casein (named BCCY-1), which was identified in our previous peptidome analysis of human milk and has great immunomodulatory activity. The results revealed that peptide BCCY-1, but not the scrambled version, enhanced monocyte migration without obvious toxicities. This selective effect was mediated via increased production of chemokines by peptide stimulated monocytes. Moreover, BCCY-1 exerted its modulatory effects by activating nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The abundances of peptide BCCY-1 and the peptides partially encompassing its fragment were found to be lower in preterm milk than in term milk. Our study may lead to new insights into the immunoregulatory effects of casein-derived peptides and facilitate the discovery of novel peptide-based food and pharmaceutical products.",2021-01-19
33510636,"The Anti-Inflammatory Effect of KS23, A Novel Peptide Derived From Globular Adiponectin, on Endotoxin-Induced Uveitis in Rats.","<b>Purpose:</b> Adiponectin has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory activities in a range of systemic inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of KS23, a globular adiponectin-derived peptide, on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells. <b>Methods:</b> EIU was induced in Lewis rats by subcutaneous injection of LPS into a single footpad. KS23 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was administered immediately after LPS induction via intravitreal injection. Twenty-four hours later, clinical and histopathological scores were evaluated, and the aqueous humor (AqH) was collected to determine the infiltrating cells, protein concentration, and levels of inflammatory cytokines. <i>In vitro</i>, cultured RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of KS23, inflammatory cytokine levels in the supernatant, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunit p65, and the expression of NF-kB signaling pathway components were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> KS23 treatment significantly ameliorated the clinical and histopathological scores of EIU rats and reduced the levels of infiltration cells, protein, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the aqueous humor. Consistently, KS23 decreased the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and inhibited the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and the phosphorylation of IKKα/β/IκBα/NF-κB. <b>Conclusion:</b> The <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> results demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of the peptide KS23 and suggested that KS23 is a compelling, novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ocular inflammation.",2021-01-12

33483574,The combination of the tubulin binding small molecule PTC596 and proteasome inhibitors suppresses the growth of myeloma cells.,"The novel small molecule PTC596 inhibits microtubule polymerization and its clinical development has been initiated for some solid cancers. We herein investigated the preclinical efficacy of PTC596 alone and in combination with proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). PTC596 inhibited the proliferation of MM cell lines as well as primary MM samples in vitro, and this was confirmed with MM cell lines in vivo. PTC596 synergized with bortezomib or carfilzomib to inhibit the growth of MM cells in vitro. The combination treatment of PTC596 with bortezomib exerted synergistic effects in a xenograft model of human MM cell lines in immunodeficient mice and exhibited acceptable tolerability. Mechanistically, treatment with PTC596 induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase followed by apoptotic cell death, associated with the inhibition of microtubule polymerization. RNA sequence analysis also revealed that PTC596 and the combination with bortezomib affected the cell cycle and apoptosis in MM cells. Importantly, endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by bortezomib was enhanced by PTC596, providing an underlying mechanism of action of the combination therapy. Our results indicate that PTC596 alone and in combination with proteasome inhibition are potential novel therapeutic options to improve outcomes in patients with MM.",2021-01-22
33482615,A novel amphibian-derived peptide alleviated ultraviolet B-induced photodamage in mice.,"Although the application potential of amphibian skin-derived active peptides in alleviating ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced damage has attracted increasing attention, research remains in its infancy. In this study, a new peptide (OM-GL15, GLLSGHYGRASPVAC) was identified from the skin of the green odorous frog (Odorrana margaretae). Results showed that OM-GL15 scavenged free radicals (2,2'-diazo-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid and 1,1-diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazine) and reduced Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, topical administration of OM-GL15 significantly alleviated UVB-induced skin photodamage in mice. Exploration of the underlying mechanisms further showed that OM-GL15 exerted antioxidant potency. Specifically, the peptide reduced the levels of lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde and protected epidermal cells from UVB-induced apoptosis by inhibiting DNA damage via down-regulation of p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax and up-regulation of Bcl-2. Our results highlight the potential application of amphibian skin-derived peptides in protection against UVB-induced photodamage and provide a novel peptide candidate for the development of anti-photodamage agents.",2021-01-19
33479615,Discovery and characterization of a novel peptide inhibitor against influenza neuraminidase.,"Neuraminidase, an abundant glycoprotein on the influenza virus surface, plays crucial roles in virus replication. Targeting neuraminidase could be a splendid way for the prevention of the spread of influenza infections. Herein, we have identified an octapeptide (errKPAQP) from a synthesized peptide library, originating from mimicking the binding pocket of oseltamivir in neuraminidase, as a potent peptide neuraminidase inhibitor. The docking-based virtual studies showed that errKPAQP exhibited a strong binding affinity (a docking score of -20.03) and nanomolar affinity (11 nM) to influenza neuraminidase, and can inhibit neuraminidase activity at a concentration as low as 4.25 μM, leading to effective protection of MDCK cells from influenza virus-induced death and replication. Furthermore, errKPAQP presented low hemolytic activity, minimal cytotoxicity, and good pharmacokinetic characteristics, which are imperative for an anti-influenza drug. Importantly, errKPAQP was capable of reducing influenza virus-induced inflammation, the serious damage to the lung tissues, and mortality rates in infected mice, indicating that it could protect against the lethal challenge of influenza viruses <i>in vivo</i>. Therefore, we have developed a novel neuraminidase peptide inhibitor with advantageous biological properties and high inhibitory activity towards neuraminidase, and it can serve as a promising anti-influenza drug.",2020-01-22
33477856,"Pharmacoinformatics and Preclinical Studies of NSC765690 and NSC765599, Potential STAT3/CDK2/4/6 Inhibitors with Antitumor Activities against NCI60 Human Tumor Cell Lines.","Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcriptional regulator of a number of biological processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis, while cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a critical regulator of cell cycle progression. These proteins appear to play central roles in angiogenesis and cell survival and are widely implicated in tumor progression. In this study, we used the well-characterized US National Cancer Institute 60 (NCI60) human tumor cell lines to screen the in vitro anti-cancer activities of our novel small molecule derivatives (NSC765690 and NSC765599) of salicylanilide. Furthermore, we used the DTP-COMPARE algorithm and in silico drug target prediction to identify the potential molecular targets, and finally, we used molecular docking to assess the interaction between the compounds and prominent potential targets. We found that NSC765690 and NSC765599 exhibited an anti-proliferative effect against the 60 panels of NCI human cancer cell lines, and dose-dependent cytotoxic preference for NSCLC, melanoma, renal, and breast cancer cell lines. Protein-ligand interactions studies revealed that NSC765690 and NSC765599 were favored ligands for STAT3/CDK2/4/6. Moreover, cyclization of the salicylanilide core scaffold of NSC765690 mediated its higher anti-cancer activities and had greater potential to interact with STAT3/CDK2/4/6 than did NSC765599 with an open-ring structure. NSC765690 and NSC765599 met the required safety and criteria of a good drug candidate, and are thus worthy of further in-vitro and in-vivo investigations in tumor-bearing mice to assess their full therapeutic efficacy.",2021-01-19
33477324,"PEG-BHD1028 Peptide Regulates Insulin Resistance and Fatty Acid β-Oxidation, and Mitochondrial Biogenesis by Binding to Two Heterogeneous Binding Sites of Adiponectin Receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2.","Adiponectin plays multiple critical roles in modulating various physiological processes by binding to its receptors. The functions of PEG-BHD1028, a potent novel peptide agonist to AdipoRs, was evaluated using in vitro and in vivo models based on the reported action spectrum of adiponectin. To confirm the design concept of PEG-BHD1028, the binding sites and their affinities were analyzed using the SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) assay. The results revealed that PEG-BHD1028 was bound to two heterogeneous binding sites of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 with a relatively high affinity. In C2C12 cells, PEG-BHD1028 significantly activated AMPK and subsequent pathways and enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, it also facilitated glucose uptake by lowering insulin resistance in insulin-resistant C2C12 cells. PEG-BHD1028 significantly reduced the fasting plasma glucose level in db/db mice following a single s.c. injection of 50, 100, and 200 μg/Kg and glucose tolerance at a dose of 50 μg/Kg with significantly decreased insulin production. The animals received 5, 25, and 50 μg/Kg of PEG-BHD1028 for 21 days significantly lost their weight after 18 days in a range of 5-7%. These results imply the development of PEG-BHD1028 as a potential adiponectin replacement therapeutic agent.",2021-01-17
33466626,The Taming of Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2-Related Factor-2 (Nrf2) Deglycation by Fructosamine-3-Kinase (FN3K)-Inhibitors-A Novel Strategy to Combat Cancers.,"Glycated stress is mediated by the advanced glycation end products (AGE) and the binding of AGEs to the receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs) in cancer cells. RAGEs are involved in mediating tumorigenesis of multiple cancers through the modulation of several downstream signaling cascades. Glycated stress modulates various signaling pathways that include p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, etc., which further foster the uncontrolled proliferation, growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and evasion of apoptosis in several cancers. In this review, a balanced overview on the role of glycation and deglycation in modulating several signaling cascades that are involved in the progression of cancers was discussed. Further, we have highlighted the functional role of deglycating enzyme fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) on Nrf2-driven cancers. The activity of FN3K is attributed to its ability to deglycate Nrf2, a master regulator of oxidative stress in cells. FN3K is a unique protein that mediates deglycation by phosphorylating basic amino acids lysine and arginine in various proteins such as Nrf2. Deglycated Nrf2 is stable and binds to small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (sMAF) proteins, thereby activating cellular antioxidant mechanisms to protect cells from oxidative stress. This cellular protection offered by Nrf2 activation, in one way, prevents the transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell; however, in the other way, it helps a cancer cell not only to survive under hypoxic conditions but also, to stay protected from various chemo- and radio-therapeutic treatments. Therefore, the activation of Nrf2 is similar to a double-edged sword and, if not controlled properly, can lead to the development of many solid tumors. Hence, there is a need to develop novel small molecule modulators/phytochemicals that can regulate FN3K activity, thereby maintaining Nrf2 in a controlled activation state.",2021-01-14

Mutation and transcriptional or post-translational modifications lead to a deregulation of kinases, which ultimately fallout into the development of pathological conditions like cancer. The human genome encodes two kinds of tyrosine kinases: non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Among these kinases, VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling cascade is an important target to develop novel small-molecule inhibitors for the therapy of abnormal angiogenesis incorporated with cancer. Due to advances in the knowledge of the catalytic domain and 'DFG-motif' region, selective 'DFG-in' (type I) and 'DFG-out' (type II) VEGFR-2/KDR inhibitors were successfully developed, and some are in different phases of a clinical trial. 'DFG-out' (inactive) confirmation has significant advantages over 'DFG-in' (active) confirmation concerning the affinity of the ATP at the catalytic domain. Further, in the catalytic domain, between front and back cleft, smaller gatekeeper residue (Val916) present; therefore, selectivity against VEGFR-2 could be precisely achieved. In this review, small molecule type II/'DFG-out' inhibitors, their conformation, interaction at receptor binding pocket, and structural requirements to inhibit VEGFR-2 at the molecular level are discussed.HighlightsVEGFR-2 is a type of membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that regulates the process of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.Small molecule first-generation type I, 'DFG-in' and second-generation type II, 'DFG-out' VEGFR-2 inhibitors exhibit clinical benefits in the treatment of aberrant angiogenesis associated with cancer.Molecular docking of FDA approved and novel type II inhibitors were performed using X-ray crystal structures of VEGFR-2; binding site analysis was carried out.Structural requirements for the inhibition of VEGFR-2 were identified.",2021-01-18
33449689,Design and Evaluation of Peptide Dual-Agonists of GLP-1 and NPY2 Receptors for Glucoregulation and Weight Loss with Mitigated Nausea and Emesis.,"There is a critical unmet need for therapeutics to treat the epidemic of comorbidities associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, ideally devoid of nausea/emesis. This study developed monomeric peptide agonists of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) and neuropeptide Y2 receptor (Y2-R) based on exendin-4 (Ex-4) and PYY<sub>3-36</sub>. A novel peptide, GEP44, was obtained via <i>in vitro</i> receptor screens, insulin secretion in islets, stability assays, and <i>in vivo</i> rat and shrew studies of glucoregulation, weight loss, nausea, and emesis. GEP44 in lean and diet-induced obese rats produced greater reduction in body weight compared to Ex-4 without triggering nausea associated behavior. Studies in the shrew demonstrated a near absence of emesis for GEP44 in contrast to Ex-4. Collectively, these data demonstrate that targeting GLP-1R and Y2-R with chimeric single peptides offers a route to new glucoregulatory treatments that are well-tolerated and have improved weight loss when compared directly to Ex-4.",2021-01-15
36262318,Solubility Measurements and Correlation of MBQ-167 in Neat and Binary Solvent Mixtures.,"MBQ-167 is a novel, small-molecule dual inhibitor of Rac and Cdc42, small GTPases that are involved in cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. In an <i>in vivo</i> mouse model, MBQ-167 has been shown to significantly reduce mammary tumor growth and metastasis and is currently undergoing preclinical studies for the treatment of metastatic cancer. To date, no solubility data have been reported for this compound. For this reason, the present study aims to determine the solubility of this compound in eight neat solvents (acetonitrile, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, methanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol) and two binary solvent mixtures [ethyl acetate (2) + heptane (3) and ethanol (2) + water (3)] between the temperatures of 278.15 and 333.15 K. The results obtained employing the polythermal method show that the solubility of MBQ-167 increases with an increase in temperature in all neat solvents used within this study. Moreover, in the two binary solvent mixtures, the solubility of this compound increases with increasing temperature and decreases with an increasing mass fraction of the antisolvent (heptane or water). The experimental solubility data were correlated using the modified Apelblat and <i>λ</i>h model equations. The predicted solubility data acquired from the Apelblat and <i>λ</i>h model equations correlate well with the experimental solubility data as indicated by the low ARD % (≤1.8304 and ≤6.5366, respectively). No solvent-mediated polymorphic phase transitions were observed while performing the solubility studies, and no other solid forms were detected after the recrystallization in the solvents and solvent mixtures. The solubility data determined here can offer pathways to develop pharmaceutical crystallization processes that can further the translation of MBQ-167 into a clinical setting.",2020-12-10

33436007,"Novel pharmacotherapy: NNI-362, an allosteric p70S6 kinase stimulator, reverses cognitive and neural regenerative deficits in models of aging and disease.","Aging is known to slow the neurogenic capacity of the hippocampus, one of only two mammalian adult neurogenic niches. The reduction of adult-born neurons with age may initiate cognitive decline progression which is exacerbated in chronic neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD). With physiologic neurogenesis diminished, but still viable in aging, non-invasive therapeutic modulation of this neuron regeneration process remains possible. The discovery of truly novel neuron regenerative therapies could be identified through phenotypic screening of small molecules that promote adult-born neurons from human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). By identifying neuron-generating therapeutics and potentially novel mechanism of actions, therapeutic benefit could be confirmed through in vivo proof-of-concept studies. The key aging and longevity mTOR/p70S6 kinase axis, a commonly targeted pathway, is substrate for potential selective kinase modulators to promote new hippocampal neurons from NPCs. The highly regulated downstream substrate of mTOR, p70S6 kinase, directly controls pleiotropic cellular activities, including translation and cell growth. Stimulating this kinase, selectively in an adult neurogenic niche, should promote NPC proliferation, and cell growth and survival in the hippocampus. Studies of kinase profiling and immunocytochemistry of human progenitor neurogenesis suggest that the novel small molecule NNI-362 stimulates p70S6 kinase phosphorylation, which, in turn, promotes proliferation and differentiation of NPCs to neurons. NNI-362 promoted the associative reversal of age- and disease-related cognitive deficits in aged mice and Down syndrome-modeled mice. This oral, allosteric modulator may ultimately be beneficial for age-related neurodegenerative disorders involving hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment, specifically AD, by promoting endogenous hippocampal regeneration.",2021-01-13
33431496,Targeting the p300/CBP Axis in Lethal Prostate Cancer.,"Resistance to androgen receptor (AR) blockade in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is associated with sustained AR signaling, including through alternative splicing of AR (AR-SV). Inhibitors of transcriptional coactivators that regulate AR activity, including the paralog histone acetyltransferase proteins p300 and CBP, are attractive therapeutic targets for lethal prostate cancer. Herein, we validate targeting p300/CBP as a therapeutic strategy for lethal prostate cancer and describe CCS1477, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the p300/CBP conserved bromodomain. We show that CCS1477 inhibits cell proliferation in prostate cancer cell lines and decreases AR- and C-MYC-regulated gene expression. In AR-SV-driven models, CCS1477 has antitumor activity, regulating AR and C-MYC signaling. Early clinical studies suggest that CCS1477 modulates KLK3 blood levels and regulates CRPC biopsy biomarker expression. Overall, CCS1477 shows promise for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Treating CRPC remains challenging due to persistent AR signaling. Inhibiting transcriptional AR coactivators is an attractive therapeutic strategy. CCS1477, an inhibitor of p300/CBP, inhibits growth and AR activity in CRPC models, and can affect metastatic CRPC target expression in serial clinical biopsies.<i>See related commentary by Rasool et al., p. 1011</i>.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 995</i>.",2021-01-11
33417771,Novel <i>N</i>-Methylated Cyclodepsipeptide Prodrugs for Targeted Cancer Therapy.,"Coibamide A (<b>1</b>) is a highly <i>N</i>-methylated cyclodepsipeptide with low nanomolar antiproliferative activities against various cancer cell lines. In previous work, we discovered a simplified analogue, [MeAla3-MeAla6]-coibamide (<b>1a</b>), which exhibited the same inhibitory abilities as coibamide A. Herein, to reduce the whole-body toxicity and improve the solubility of <b>1a</b>, two novel peptide-drug conjugates RGD-SS-CA (<b>2</b>) and RGD-VC-CA (<b>3</b>) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. Composed of cyclodepsipeptide <b>1a</b>, a tumor-homing RGD motif, and a conditionally labile linker, the conjugates are expected to release <b>1a</b> tracelessly in specific tumor microenvironments. Compared with RGD-VC-CA (<b>3</b>), RGD-SS-CA (<b>2</b>) proved to be superior in in vitro drug release and cytotoxicity tests. Notably, intravenous injection of RGD-SS-CA (<b>2</b>) into mice-bearing human tumor xenografts induced significant tumor growth suppression with negligible toxicity. Therefore, as a novel prodrug of the coibamide A analogue, conjugate <b>2</b> has great potential for further exploration in cancer drug discovery.",2021-01-08
33413613,A novel small molecule CXCR4 antagonist potently mobilizes hematopoietic stem cells in mice and monkeys.,"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is an effective treatment strategy for many types of diseases. Peripheral blood (PB) is the most commonly used source of bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells for current HSC transplantation. However, PB usually contains very few HSCs under normal conditions, as these cells are normally retained within the BM. This retention depends on the interaction between the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expressed on the HSCs and its natural chemokine ligand, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α (also named CXCL12) present in the BM stromal microenvironment. In clinical practice, blocking this interaction with a CXCR4 antagonist can induce the rapid mobilization of HSCs from the BM into the PB.",2021-01-07
33411696,A STAT3 inhibitor ameliorates CNS autoimmunity by restoring Teff:Treg balance.,"Reestablishing an appropriate balance between T effector cells (Teff) and Tregs is essential for correcting autoimmunity. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated chronic CNS disease characterized by neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neuronal degeneration, in which the Teff:Treg balance is skewed toward pathogenic Teffs Th1 and Th17 cells. STAT3 is a key regulator of Teff:Treg balance. Using the structure-based design, we have developed a potentially novel small-molecule prodrug LLL12b that specifically inhibits STAT3 and suppresses Th17 differentiation and expansion. Moreover, LLL12b regulates the fate decision between Th17 and Tregs in an inflammatory environment, shifting Th17:Treg balance toward Tregs and favoring the resolution of inflammation. Therapeutic administration of LLL12b after disease onset significantly suppresses disease progression in adoptively transferred, chronic, and relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Disease relapses were also significantly suppressed by LLL12b given during the remission phase. Additionally, LLL12b shifts Th17:Treg balance of CD4+ T cells from MS patients toward Tregs and increases Teff sensitivity to Treg-mediated suppression. These data suggest that selective inhibition of STAT3 by the small molecule LLL12b recalibrates the effector and regulatory arms of CD4+ T responses, representing a potentially clinically translatable therapeutic strategy for MS.",2021-02-22
33401248,6-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (6BIO) prevents myocardium from aging by inducing autophagy.,"6-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (6BIO) is a novel small molecule that exerts positive effects on several age-related alterations. However, the anti-aging effects of 6BIO on the aging heart remain unknown. Herein, we aim to investigate the effects of 6BIO on the myocardium and its underlying mechanism <i>in vivo</i> and vitro. Following 6BIO treatment, an increased p53 contents, a reduced p16 and β-gal levels, and attenuation of cardiac fibrosis were observed, suggesting 6BIO retarded aging of cardiomyocytes. As observed, 6BIO reduced p62 contents, elevated the levels of Beclin-1 and the ratio of LC3II/I, indicating the induction of autophagy, while the reduction of the accumulation of ROS indicated 6BIO alleviated oxidative stress. In addition, 6BIO treatment inhibited both GSK3β signaling and mTOR signaling. 6BIO might be a promising agent for preventing myocardium from aging.",2020-12-26

It is undergoing preclinical development as a therapeutic for brain-localized malignancies. The aim of this study was to characterize metabolism and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of NEO212 in preclinical models.,2020-11-20
33387593,Bifunctional GM-CSF-derived peptides as tools for O-glycoengineering and protein tagging.,"Rapid development of effective biotherapeutics has been a concern during the last couple decades. In our work we designed two novel peptide tags, GMOP and mGMOP, derived from the N-terminal region of human granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF), which contain four and six potential O-glycosylation sites, respectively. These peptide tags were fused to the N-terminus of human interferon-α2b (hIFN-α2b), a therapeutic antiviral and antiproliferative protein rapidly cleared from circulation. Two new molecules were obtained which, consistently with the presence of O-glycans, showed higher molecular masses, more negatively charged isoforms, and higher sialic acid content compared to wild-type IFN. In vitro bioactivity of purified chimeras revealed a similar antiviral specific biological activity (SBA) compared to unmodified IFN. A reduction of antiproliferative SBA was only observed for mGMOP-IFN. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed a notable improvement in terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2elim</sub>) (3.3 and 2.8 times-longer) and a marked reduction of the apparent clearance (CLapp, 3.7 and 4.1-fold lower for GMOP-IFN and mGMOP-IFN in comparison with native IFN, respectively). Furthermore, the in vitro thermal and plasma stability of both proteins was improved. Finally, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes an N-terminal GM-CSF epitope was able to bind both chimeras in western blots and ELISAs. This demonstrates the potential of both peptides to behave as bifunctional tags to create novel long-acting biotherapeutics and to facilitate detection and purification.",2020-12-30
33383258,The discovery of novel small molecule allosteric activators of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2.,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) plays important role in ethanol metabolism, and also serves as an important shield from the damage occurring under oxidative stress. A special inactive variant was found carried by 35-45% of East Asians. The variant carriers have recently been found at the higher risk for the diseases related to the damage occurring under oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. As a result, ALDH2 activators may potentially serve as a new class of therapeutics. Herein, N-benzylanilines were found as novel allosteric activators of ALDH2 by computational virtual screening using ligand-based and structure-based screening parallel screening strategy. Then a structural optimization was performed and has led to the discovery of the compound C6. It has good activity in vitro and in vivo, which could reduce infarct size by ∼70% in ischemic stroke rat models. This study provided good lead compounds for the further development of ALDH2 activators.",2020-12-28
33378949,Protective effects of PARP1-inhibitory compound in dry age-related macular degeneration.,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-dependent cell death in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is implicated in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although PARP1 inhibitors are available for treating dry AMD, their delivery route is not ideal for patients. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel PARP1-inhibitory compound (PIC) in vitro and in vivo. This study presents PIC, a novel small molecule, with superior efficacy to PARP1 inhibitors in the market. PIC demonstrated a distinctive inhibitory profile against PARP isotypes than the FDA-approved PARP1 inhibitors. PIC inhibited PARP1 activation at an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.41 ± 0.15 nM in an enzyme-based assay in vitro and at IC<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> in ARPE-19 cells of 0.11 ± 0.02 nM and 0.22 ± 0.02 nM, respectively, upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> insult. PIC also moderated mitochondrial fission and depolarization and maintained cellular energy levels under oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, PIC demonstrated good corneal penetration in a rat model, presenting PIC as a promising candidate for eye drop therapeutics for dry AMD. When PIC was administered as an eye drop formulation, RPE morphology was preserved, maintaining the thickness of the outer nuclear layers under sodium iodate (SI) treatment in rats. In SI-treated rabbits, eye drop administration of PIC also retained the structural and functional integrity when analyzed using funduscopy and electroretinogram. Collectively, our data portray PIC as an attractive treatment measure for dry AMD.",2020-12-02
33375358,Discovery of Monoacylglycerol Lipase (MAGL) Inhibitors Based on a Pharmacophore-Guided Virtual Screening Study.,"Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is an important enzyme of the endocannabinoid system that catalyzes the degradation of the major endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). MAGL is associated with pathological conditions such as pain, inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, elevated levels of MAGL have been found in aggressive breast, ovarian and melanoma cancer cells. Due to its different potential therapeutic implications, MAGL is considered as a promising target for drug design and the discovery of novel small-molecule MAGL inhibitors is of great interest in the medicinal chemistry field. In this context, we developed a pharmacophore-based virtual screening protocol combined with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, which showed a final hit rate of 50% validating the reliability of the in silico workflow and led to the identification of two promising and structurally different reversible MAGL inhibitors, VS1 and VS2. These ligands represent a valuable starting point for structure-based hit-optimization studies aimed at identifying new potent MAGL inhibitors.",2020-12-26

33363709,Design of novel small molecule base-pair recognizers of toxic CUG RNA transcripts characteristics of DM1.,"Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an incurable neuromuscular disorder caused by toxic DMPK transcripts that carry CUG repeat expansions in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The intrinsic complexity and lack of crystallographic data makes noncoding RNA regions challenging targets to study in the field of drug discovery. In DM1, toxic transcripts tend to stall in the nuclei forming complex inclusion bodies called foci and sequester many essential alternative splicing factors such as Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1). Most DM1 phenotypic features stem from the reduced availability of free MBNL1 and therefore many therapeutic efforts are focused on recovering its normal activity. For that purpose, herein we present pyrido[2,3-<i>d</i>]pyrimidin-7-(8<i>H</i>)-ones, a privileged scaffold showing remarkable biological activity against many targets involved in human disorders including cancer and viral diseases. Their combination with a flexible linker meets the requirements to stabilise DM1 toxic transcripts, and therefore, enabling the release of MBNL1. Therefore, a set of novel pyrido[2,3-<i>d</i>]pyrimidin-7-(8<i>H</i>)-ones derivatives (<b>1a</b>-<b>e</b>) were obtained using click chemistry. <b>1a</b> exerted over 20% MBNL1 recovery on DM1 toxic RNA activity in primary cell biology studies using patient-derived myoblasts. <b>1a</b> promising anti DM1 activity may lead to subsequent generations of ligands, highlighting a new affordable treatment against DM1.",2020-12-06
33362550,"New Insights Into Peptide Cannabinoids: Structure, Biosynthesis and Signaling.","Classically, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) consists of endogenous lipids, of which the best known are anandamide (AEA) and 2 arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), their enzyme machinery for synthesis and degradation and their specific receptors, cannabinoid receptor one (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor two (CB2). However, endocannabinoids also bind to other groups of receptors. Furthermore, another group of lipids are considered to be endocannabinoids, such as the fatty acid ethanolamides, the fatty acid primary amides and the monoacylglycerol related molecules. Recently, it has been shown that the hemopressin peptide family, derived from α and β chains of hemoglobins, is a new family of cannabinoids. Some studies indicate that hemopressin peptides are expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues and act as ligands of these receptors, thus suggesting that they play a physiological role. In this review, we examine new evidence on lipid endocannabinoids, cannabinoid receptors and the modulation of their signaling pathways. We focus our discussion on the current knowledge of the pharmacological effects, the biosynthesis of the peptide cannabinoids and the new insights on the activation and modulation of cannabinoid receptors by these peptides. The novel peptide compounds derived from hemoglobin chains and their non-classical activation of cannabinoid receptors are only starting to be uncovered. It will be exciting to follow the ensuing discoveries, not only in reference to what is already known of the classical lipid endocannabinoids revealing more complex aspects of endocannabinoid system, but also as to its possibilities as a future therapeutic tool.",2020-12-09
33361117,Restoration of motor learning in a mouse model of Rett syndrome following long-term treatment with a novel small-molecule activator of TrkB.,"Reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and impaired activation of the BDNF receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB; also known as Ntrk2), are thought to contribute significantly to the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Previous studies from this and other laboratories have shown that enhancing BDNF expression and/or TrkB activation in <i>Mecp2</i>-deficient mouse models of RTT can ameliorate or reverse abnormal neurological phenotypes that mimic human RTT symptoms. The present study reports on the preclinical efficacy of a novel, small-molecule, non-peptide TrkB partial agonist, PTX-BD4-3, in heterozygous female <i>Mecp2</i> mutant mice, a well-established RTT model that recapitulates the genetic mosaicism of the human disease. PTX-BD4-3 exhibited specificity for TrkB in cell-based assays of neurotrophin receptor activation and neuronal cell survival and in <i>in vitro</i> receptor binding assays. PTX-BD4-3 also activated TrkB following systemic administration to wild-type and <i>Mecp2</i> mutant mice and was rapidly cleared from the brain and plasma with a half-life of ∼2 h. Chronic intermittent treatment of <i>Mecp2</i> mutants with a low dose of PTX-BD4-3 (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, once every 3 days for 8 weeks) reversed deficits in two core RTT symptom domains - respiration and motor control - and symptom rescue was maintained for at least 24 h after the last dose. Together, these data indicate that significant clinically relevant benefit can be achieved in a mouse model of RTT with a chronic intermittent, low-dose treatment paradigm targeting the neurotrophin receptor TrkB.",2020-11-27
33360802,Omipalisib inspired macrocycles as dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.,"Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway occurs frequently in a wide range of human cancers and is a main driver of cell growth, proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance of cancer cells. Compounds targeting this pathway are under active development as anticancer therapeutics and some of them have reached advanced clinical trials or been approved by the FDA. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors combine multiple therapeutic efficacies in a single molecule by inhibiting the pathway both upstream and downstream of AKT. Herein, we report our efforts on the exploration of novel small molecule macrocycles (MCXs) as dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Macrocyclization is an attractive approach used in drug discovery, as the semi-rigid character of these structures could provide improved potency, selectivity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Importantly, this strategy allows access to new chemical space thus obtaining a better intellectual property position. A series of MCXs based on GSK-2126458, a known clinical PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is described. These molecules showed potent biochemical and cellular dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition, demonstrated strong antitumoral effects in human cancer cell lines, and displayed good drug-like properties. Among them, MCX 83 presented remarkable selectivity against a panel of 468 kinases, high in vitro metabolic stability, and favorable pharmacokinetic parameters without significant CYP450 and h-ERG binding inhibition. This profile qualified this compound as a suitable candidate for future in vivo PK-PD and efficacy studies in mouse cancer models.",2020-12-18
33354831,"Pharmacodynamics-based approach for efficacious human dose projection of BMS-986260, a small molecule transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 inhibitor.","Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has a wide array of biological effects. For decades, tumor biology implicated TGF-β as an attractive therapeutic target due to its immunosuppressive effects. Toward this end, multiple pharmaceutical companies developed a number of drug modalities that specifically target the TGF-β pathway. BMS-986260 is a small molecule, selective TGF-βR1 kinase inhibitor that was under preclinical development for oncology. In vivo studies across mouse, rat, dog, and monkey and cryopreserved hepatocytes predicted human pharmacokinetics (PK) and distribution of BMS-986260. Efficacy studies of BMS-986260 were undertaken in the MC38 murine colon cancer model, and target engagement, as measured by phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, was assessed in whole blood to predict the clinical efficacious dose. The human clearance is predicted to be low, 4.25 ml/min/kg. BMS-986260 provided a durable and robust antitumor response at 3.75 mg/kg daily and 1.88 mg/kg twice-daily dosing regimens. Phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 was 3.5-fold less potent in human monocytes than other preclinical species. Taken together, the projected clinical efficacious dose was 600 mg QD or 210 mg BID for 3 days followed by a 4-day drug holiday. Mechanism-based cardiovascular findings in the rat ultimately led to the termination of BMS-986260. This study describes the preclinical PK characterization and pharmacodynamics-based efficacious dose projection of a novel small molecule TGF-βR1 inhibitor.",2021-01-08

33344891,Pharmacological Inhibition of BAD Ser99 Phosphorylation Enhances the Efficacy of Cisplatin in Ovarian Cancer by Inhibition of Cancer Stem Cell-like Behavior.,"Platinum-based chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for ovarian cancer patients for approximately four decades. However, the prognosis of patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma remains dismal, mainly attributed to both dose-limiting toxicities of cisplatin and the high rate of chemo-resistant disease recurrence. Herein, both patient-derived and experimentally generated cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cell line models were used to delineate BADSer99 phosphorylation as an actionable target in ovarian cancer. BADSer99 phosphorylation was negatively associated with cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer, and the inhibition of BADSer99 phosphorylation by point mutation induced apoptosis and reduced cisplatin IC<sub>50</sub>. In addition, BAD phosphorylation was also shown to be associated with cancer stem cell-like properties. Henceforth, a novel small molecule which inhibits BAD phosphorylation specifically at Ser99 (NPB) was utilized. NPB promoted apoptosis and reduced 3D growth of bulk cancer cells and inhibited cancer stem cell-like properties in both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cells. The combination of cisplatin with NPB exhibited synergistic effects <i>in vitro</i>. NPB in combination with cisplatin also achieved an improved outcome compared to either monotreatment <i>in vivo</i>, including suppression of the cancer stem cell population, an effect not observed with cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, NPB exhibited strong synergistic effects with the AKT inhibitor AZD5363, and significantly reduced its IC<sub>50</sub> in cells resistant to cisplatin treatment. These findings identify BADSer99 phosphorylation as an actionable and pharmacologically relevant target to improve outcomes of cisplatin treated ovarian cancer.",2020-10-09
33316691,Discovery of a novel small-molecule inhibitor of Fam20C that induces apoptosis and inhibits migration in triple negative breast cancer.,"The family with sequence similarity 20, member C (Fam20C), a Golgi casein kinase, has been recently regarded as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Lacking enzyme activity center has been becoming an obstacle to the development of small-molecule inhibitors of Fam20C. Herein, we combined in silico high-throughput screening with chemical synthesis methods to obtain a new small-molecule Fam20C inhibitor 3r, which exhibited desired anti-proliferative activities against MDA-MB-231 cells and also inhibited migration. Subsequently, the enzymatic assay, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for validating that 3r could bind to Fam20C. In addition, 3r was found to induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells as well as to inhibit cell migration. Moreover, we demonstrated that 3r inhibited tumor growth in vivo and thereby having a good therapeutic potential on TNBC. Taken together, these results suggest that 3r may be a novel Fam20C inhibitor with anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities, which would shed light on discovering more small-molecule drugs for the future TNBC therapy.",2020-12-07
33314617,Selection of a new peptide homing SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells.,"Breast cancer diagnosis remains a challenge, mostly due to its heterogeneity. This reality translates in delayed treatments, increasing treatment aggressiveness and lower chances of overall survival. The conventional detection techniques, although becoming increasingly sophisticated each year, still lack the ability to provide reliable conclusions without being time consuming, expensive, and uncomfortable for the patients. The identification of novel biomarkers for breast cancer research is therefore of utmost relevance for an early diagnosis. Moreover, breast cancer-specific peptide moieties can be used to develop novel targeted drug delivery systems. In this work, we used phage display to identify a novel peptide with specificity to the SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell line. Cytometry assays confirmed its specificity, while bioinformatics and docking studies predicted the potential biomarkers at the SK-BR-3 cells' surface. These findings can be potentially useful in the clinical context, contributing to more specific and targeted therapeutic solutions against HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes.",2020-12-25

33275464,Advances in the design and discovery of novel small molecule drugs for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome.,"<b>Introduction</b>: Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy) begins in the first year of life characterized by generalized or unilateral clonic seizures that are frequently triggered by high fever. A subsequent worsening stage occurs (in years 1-4 of life) and seizure activity is accompanied by disturbed psychomotor development. The third stage of the disease, known as the 'stabilization phase,' is associated with seizures and intellectual impairment. Of note, a mutation in the voltage-gated sodium-channel gene α 1 subunit (SCN1A) has been found in around 85% of patients with Dravet syndrome.<b>Areas covered</b>: The authors review the current treatment strategies as well as potential drugs in the initial stages of clinical evaluation. The authors also review drugs with protective activity in mice models of Dravet syndrome.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Experimental data and results from initial clinical studies have brought attention to several drugs with various mechanisms of action including: ataluren (a suppressant of premature stop codons; under clinical evaluation), EPX-100, EPX-200, fenfluramine (serotonin modulators), soticlestat (an 24-hydroxylase cholesterol enzyme inhibitor), SPN-817 (an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase), verapamil (a voltage-dependent calcium channel inhibitor) and STK-001 (an antisense oligonucleotide). The latter is scheduled for clinical evaluation.",2020-12-17

33268144,"Discovery of 4H-chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivatives as senescence inducers and their senescence-associated antiproliferative activities on cancer cells using advanced phenotypic assay.","Current research suggests therapy-induced senescence (TIS) of cancer cells characterized by distinct morphological and biochemical phenotypic changes represent a novel functional target that may enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapy. In order to identify novel small-molecule inducers of cellular senescence and determine the potential to be used for the treatment of melanoma, a new method of high-throughput screening (HTS) and high-contents screening (HCS) based on the detection of morphological changes was designed. This image-based and whole cell-based technology was applied to screen and select a novel class of antiproliferative agents on cancer cells, 4H-chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivatives, which induced senescence-like phenotypic changes in human melanoma A375 cells without serious cytotoxicity against normal cells. To evaluate structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of 4H-chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one scaffold starting from hit 3, a focused library containing diversely modified analogues was constructed and which led to the identification of 38, a novel compound to have remarkable anti-melanoma activity in vitro with good metabolic stability.",2020-07-19
33255326,Novel Small-Molecule Scaffolds as Candidates against the SARS Coronavirus 2 Main Protease: A Fragment-Guided in Silico Approach.,"The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has been the greatest global health crisis since the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. Thus far, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 1 million deaths, and there is no cure or vaccine to date. The recently solved crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease has been a major focus for drug-discovery efforts. Here, we present a fragment-guided approach using ZINCPharmer, where 17 active fragments known to bind to the catalytic centre of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>) were used as pharmacophore queries to search the ZINC databases of natural compounds and natural derivatives. This search yielded 134 hits that were then subjected to multiple rounds of in silico analyses, including blind and focused docking against the 3D structure of the main protease. We scrutinised the poses, scores, and protein-ligand interactions of 15 hits and selected 7. The scaffolds of the seven hits were structurally distinct from known inhibitor scaffolds, thus indicating scaffold novelty. Our work presents several novel scaffolds as potential candidates for experimental validation against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>.",2020-11-24
33254439,Development of small molecule inhibitors/agonists targeting STING for disease.,"Cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) -stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway is the primary immune response pathway in the cytoplasm. Pharmacological regulation of the STING pathway has good characteristics in both structure and function, which plays a significant role in the immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases, autoinflammatory diseases, and cancer. In this review, we summarized the activation of STING signaling pathway, the STING-related diseases, the development principle and the latest progress of inhibitors and agonists targeting STING. Our review demonstrates that STING signal pathway is a promising drug target, providing effective clues and correct guidance for the discovery of novel small molecule inhibitors/agonists that targeted STING for cancer, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.",2020-11-01
33248693,Novel scorpion venom peptide HsTx2 ameliorates cerebral ischemic brain injury in rats via the MAPK signaling pathway.,"Ischemic stroke is a severe threat to human health due to its high recurrence, mortality, and disability rates. As such, how to prevent and treat ischemic stroke effectively has become a research hotspot in recent years. Here, we identified a novel peptide, named HsTx2 (AGKKERAGSRRTKIVMLKCIREHGH, 2 861.855 Da), derived from the scorpion Heterometrus spinifer, which showed obvious anti-apoplectic effects in rats with ischemic stroke. Results further demonstrated that HsTx2 significantly reduced formation of infarct area and improved behavioral abnormalities in ischemic stroke rats. These protective effects were likely exerted via activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, i.e., up-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in both rat cerebral cortex and activated microglia (AM); up-regulation of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) in the cerebral cortex; and inhibition of phosphorylated JNK and p-p38 levels in the AM. In conclusion, this study highlights HsTx2 as a potential neuroprotective agent for stroke.",2020-11-25
33236147,A novel peptide relieves endothelial cell dysfunction in preeclampsia by regulating the PI3K/mTOR/HIF1α pathway.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy‑specific complication characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, and it is one of the primary global causes of maternal and perinatal mortality. Poor remodeling of placental arteries and endothelial dysfunction serve important roles in the pathogenesis of PE. Peptide derived from complement C4 A chain (PDCC4) was identified in our previous peptidome analysis of serum from patients with PE. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of PDCC4 on endothelial dysfunction in PE. TNF‑α stimulated HUVECs were employed to mimic endothelial dysfunction in PE, and Cell Counting Kit 8 assay, wound healing assay, tube formation assay, RNA‑sequencing (seq) and western blot analysis were performed using HUVECs. Moreover, an in vivo model of PE was established using pregnant rats treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and blood pressure monitoring, histopathological examination, ELISA and immunohistochemistry were performed on rats. It was found that TNF‑α impaired proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs, but pretreatment with PDCC4 moderated these effects. RNA‑seq and western blotting demonstrated that the PI3K/mTOR/HIF1α signaling pathway was activated by PDCC4, and a selective PI3K inhibitor reversed the protective function of PDCC4 on TNF‑α stimulated HUVECs. Additionally, PDCC4 alleviated hypertension, histopathological changes of placenta and kidney and the expression levels of endothelial injury markers and inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS in rats. These results suggested that PDCC4 relieved endothelial dysfunction in PE via PI3K/mTOR/HIF1α signaling pathway and may be a potential therapy for PE.",2020-11-19
33220421,Discovery of a novel short peptide with efficacy in accelerating the healing of skin wounds.,"Despite extensive efforts to develop efficacious therapeutic approaches, the treatment of skin wounds remains a considerable clinical challenge. Existing remedies cannot sufficiently meet current needs, so the discovery of novel pro-healing agents is of growing importance. In the current research, we identified a novel short peptide (named RL-QN15, primary sequence 'QNSYADLWCQFHYMC') from Rana limnocharis skin secretions, which accelerated wound healing in mice. Exploration of the underlying mechanisms showed that RL-QN15 activated the MAPK and Smad signaling pathways, and selectively modulated the secretion of cytokines from macrophages. This resulted in the proliferation and migration of skin cells and dynamic regulation of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 in wounds, which accelerated re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation and thus skin regeneration. Moreover, RL-QN15 showed significant therapeutic potency against chronic wounds, skin fibrosis, and oral ulcers. Our results highlight frog skin secretions as a potential treasure trove of bioactive peptides with healing activity. The novel peptide (RL-QN15) identified in this research shows considerable capacity as a candidate for the development of novel pro-healing agents.",2020-11-19
33218072,Discovery and Design of Novel Small Molecule GSK-3 Inhibitors Targeting the Substrate Binding Site.,"The serine/threonine kinase, GSK-3, is a promising drug discovery target for treating multiple pathological disorders. Most GSK-3 inhibitors that were developed function as ATP competitive inhibitors, with typical limitations in specificity, safety and drug-induced resistance. In contrast, substrate competitive inhibitors (SCIs), are considered highly selective, and more suitable for clinical practice. The development of SCIs has been largely neglected in the past because the ambiguous, undefined nature of the substrate-binding site makes them difficult to design. In this study, we used our previously described structural models of GSK-3 bound to SCI peptides, to design a pharmacophore model and to virtually screen the ""drug-like"" Zinc database (~6.3 million compounds). We identified leading hits that interact with critical binding elements in the GSK-3 substrate binding site and are chemically distinct from known GSK-3 inhibitors. Accordingly, novel GSK-3 SCI compounds were designed and synthesized with IC<sub>50</sub> values of~1-4 μM. Biological activity of the SCI compound was confirmed in cells and in primary neurons that showed increased β-catenin levels and reduced tau phosphorylation in response to compound treatment. We have generated a new type of small molecule GSK-3 inhibitors and propose to use this strategy to further develop SCIs for other protein kinases.",2020-11-18
33210912,Novel Pentapeptide Derived from Chicken by-Product Ameliorates DSS-Induced Colitis by Enhancing Intestinal Barrier Function via AhR-Induced Src Inactivation.,"Managing patients with refractory inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is a common clinical challenge. Galli Gigeriae Endothelium Corneum (GGEC), a chicken by-product, has been used for centuries in Asian countries as a functional food and supplement for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. In this study, a novel peptide (LNLYP, LP-5) with gastrointestinal stability that can enhance the intestinal barrier function that was first identified in GGEC. Our work demonstrated that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation by LP-5 could inhibit the Src kinase to increase tight junction protein levels and down-regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines to protect the intestinal barrier and finally alleviate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. This study revealed that LP-5 had the potential to develop into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of colitis and provided new high-valued utilization of GGEC.",2020-11-19
33205861,The novel peptide NbPPI1 identified from Nicotiana benthamiana triggers immune responses and enhances resistance against Phytophthora pathogens.,"In plants, recognition of small secreted peptides, such as damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), regulates diverse processes, including stress and immune responses. Here, we identified an SGPS (Ser-Gly-Pro-Ser) motif-containing peptide, Nicotiana tabacum NtPROPPI, and its two homologs in Nicotiana benthamiana, NbPROPPI1 and NbPROPPI2. Phytophthora parasitica infection and salicylic acid (SA) treatment induced NbPROPPI1/2 expression. Moreover, SignalP predicted that the 89-amino acid NtPROPPI includes a 24-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and NbPROPPI1/2-GFP fusion proteins were mainly localized to the periplasm. Transient expression of NbPROPPI1/2 inhibited P. parasitica colonization, and NbPROPPI1/2 knockdown rendered plants more susceptible to P. parasitica. An eight-amino-acid segment in the NbPROPPI1 C-terminus was essential for its immune function and a synthetic 20-residue peptide, NbPPI1, derived from the C-terminus of NbPROPPI1 provoked significant immune responses in N. benthamiana. These responses led to enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and up-regulation of the defense genes Flg22-induced receptor-like kinase (FRK) and WRKY DNA-binding protein 33 (WRKY33). The NbPPI1-induced defense responses require Brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1). These results suggest that NbPPI1 functions as a DAMP in N. benthamiana; this novel DAMP provides a potentially useful target for improving plant resistance to Pytophthora pathogens.",2021-03-15
33198343,Exploring the Role of a Novel Peptide from <i>Allomyrina dichotoma</i> Larvae in Ameliorating Lipid Metabolism in Obesity.,"The aim of this study was to identify an anti-obesity peptide from <i>Allomyrina dichotoma</i> and investigate the lipid metabolic mechanism. Enzymatically hydrolyzed <i>A. dichotoma</i> larvae were further separated using tangential flow filtration and consecutive chromatographic processes. Finally, an anti-obesity peptide that showed the highest inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation was obtained, and the sequence was Glu-Ile-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Lys-Thr-Asp-Leu (EIA10). EIA10 decreased lipid aggregation in vitro and significantly reduced the accumulation of body weight gain, liver weight, and adipose tissue weight in high-fat-fed mice. Compared with the control group, the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in the high-fat diet (HFD) group increased significantly, and the content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) in the serum decreased significantly. On the contrary, the levels of TC, TG, and insulin in the EIA10 group decreased significantly, and the HDL content increased significantly compared with the HFD group. Additionally, EIA10 dramatically decreased mRNA and protein levels of transcription factors involved in lipid adipogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that EIA10 could be a promising agent for the treatment and prevention of obesity.",2020-11-12
33189437,Synthesis and characterization of new potent TLR7 antagonists based on analysis of the binding mode using biomolecular simulations.,"Aberrant activation of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) has been implicated in myriad autoimmune diseases and is an established therapeutic target in such conditions. Development of diverse TLR7 antagonists is mainly accomplished through random screening. To correlate human TLR7 (hTLR7) antagonistic activity with the structural features in different chemotypes, we derived a hypothetical binding model based on molecular docking analysis along with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study. The binding hypothesis revealed different pockets, grooves and a central cavity where ligand-receptor interaction with specific residues through hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions take place, which correlate with TLR7 antagonistic activity thus paving the way for rational design using varied chemotypes. Based on the structural insight thus gained, TLR7 antagonists with quinazoline were designed to understand the effect of engagement of these pockets as well as boundaries of the chemical space associated with them. The newly synthesized most potent hTLR7 antagonist, i.e. compound 63, showed IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.03 ± 0.05 μM and was validated by performing primary assay in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) (IC<sub>50</sub><sup>pDC</sup>: 1.42 μM). The biological validation of the synthesized molecules was performed in TLR7-reporter HEK293 cells as well as in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Our study provides a rational design approach thus facilitating further development of novel small molecule hTLR7 antagonists based on different chemical scaffolds.",2020-10-31
33185232,Discovery of a novel rice-derived peptide with significant anti-gout potency.,"As a metabolic disease, gout, which seriously affects the normal life of patients, has become increasingly common in modern society. However, the existing medicines cannot completely meet the clinical needs. In the current study, a novel short peptide (named rice-derived-peptide-2 (RDP2), AAAAGAMPK-NH2, 785.97 Da) was isolated and identified from water extract of shelled Oryza sativa fruits, without toxic side effects but excellent stability. Our results indicated that RDP2 (the minimum effective concentration is 5 μg kg<sup>-1</sup>) induced a significant reduction in serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic mice via suppressing xanthine oxidase activity and urate transporter 1 expression, as well as alleviated renal damage through inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, RDP2 can also alleviate paw swelling and inflammatory reactions in mice after subcutaneous injection of monosodium urate crystals. As mentioned above, we obtained a novel peptide which could work through all stages of gout, not only reducing uric acid levels and renal damage in hyperuricemic mice, but also alleviating inflammatory responses associated with acute gout attack, and thus provided a new peptide molecular template for the development of anti-gout drugs.",2020-11-13
33183172,LRH-1 (liver receptor homolog-1) derived affinity peptide ligand to inhibit interactions between β-catenin and LRH-1 in pancreatic cancer cells: from computational design to experimental validation.,"Poor prognosis, rapid progression and the lack of an effective treatment make pancreatic cancer one of the most lethal malignancies. Recent studies point to a role for liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) in pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer and suggest prevention of the β-catenin/LRH-1 complex formation as a potential strategy for inhibition of the pancreas cancer cells progression. In the current investigation, we have followed a biomimetic strategy and designed an affinity peptide with sequence DEMEEPQQTE to inhibit formation of the β-catenin/LRH-1 complex. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments on the AsPC-1 pancreatic metastatic cells showed that the peptide has an inhibitory effect on the Wnt signaling proliferation line by reducing the expression levels of the <i>CCND1</i>, <i>CCNE1</i>, and <i>MYC</i> genes. Furthermore, the increased expression level of <i>BAX</i> gene showed that AsPC-1 cells were directed to the apoptosis pathway. At last, <i>POU5F1</i>, <i>KLF4</i>, and <i>CD44</i> gene expression levels suggested that the peptide has an inhibitory effect on the stemness feature of the AsPC-1 cells. Here, we introduced a novel peptide inhibitor targeting an important protein-protein interaction, the β-catenin/LRH-1 complex, which may provide highly promising starting points for subsequent drug design.

33183015,A heavily pre-treated adenocarcinoma patient with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation responded to pembrolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel/bevacizumab: a case report.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertions are often associated with poor clinical outcomes due to low response rate to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although recent studies have demonstrated that several novel small molecule compounds could selectively inhibit these mutations, there are still some patients who cannot benefit from them. Another potential therapeutic approach is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Growing evidence suggests that patients harboring EGFR mutations show low efficacy with the use of immunotherapy. However, according to the different immunogenicity of different EGFR mutations, the role of immunotherapy in EGFRex20ins NSCLCs needs further confirmation. Herein we report a case of a 39-year-old woman with NSCLC harboring EGFRex20ins who was diagnosed as postoperative recurrence of lung cancer. She failed with oral poziotinib, then underwent four cycles of systemic chemotherapy with pemetrexed plus carboplatin and bevacizumab. CT scan after chemotherapy showed the metastatic tumors increased in size. The patient then received osimertinib plus cetuximab. CT evaluation performed one month after treatment revealed the enlargement of bilateral lung metastasis. Pembrolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel/bevacizumab was given every three weeks afterwards. Significant shrinkage in multiple metastatic tumors was observed through CT, resulting in a partial response and a progression-free survival of more than 5.0 months. This case highlighted that the use of pembrolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel/bevacizumab could help in the management of the uncommon EGFRex20ins in heavily pretreated patients.",2020-11-05
33180016,A novel peptide nucleic acid- and loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of mutations in the 23S rRNA gene of <i>Treponema pallidum</i>.,"<b>Introduction.</b> Macrolides could be a potential alternative treatment for <i>Treponema pallidum</i> infections in patients; however, macrolide-resistant <i>T. pallidum</i> is spreading rapidly worldwide.<b>Hypothesis/Gap Statement</b>. There are presently no alternatives to serological tests for syphilis that can be used to evaluate therapeutic effects due to the fact that <i>T. pallidum</i> cannot be cultured <i>in vitro</i>.<b>Aim.</b> In this study, we constructed a method for rapidly identifying <i>T. pallidum</i> and confirming macrolide resistance by using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with peptide nucleic acids (PNAs).<b>Methodology.</b> A set of LAMP primers was designed to span nucleotide positions 2058 and 2059 in 23S rRNA. A PNA clamping probe was also designed to be complementary to the wild-type sequence (A2058/A2059) and positioned to interfere with both the annealing of the 3' end of the backward inner primer and the concomitant extension. Prior to the LAMP assay, swab samples from suspected syphilitic lesions were boiled for DNA extraction.<b>Results.</b> The assay had an equivalent detection limit of 1.0×10<sup>1</sup> copies/reaction and showed specificity against 38 pathogens. In the presence of a 4 µM PNA probe, LAMP amplified up to 1.0×101 copies/reaction using plasmids harbouring the complementary mutant sequences (A2058G or A2059G), whereas amplification was completely blocked for the wild-type sequence up to a concentration of 1.0×10<sup>3</sup> copies/reaction. For the 66 PCR-positive clinical specimens, the overall detection rate via LAMP was 93.9 % (62/66). Amplification was successful for all 53 mutant samples and was incomplete for all nine WT samples by the PNA-mediated LAMP assays.<b>Conclusion.</b> We developed a PNA-mediated LAMP method that enabled us to rapidly identify <i>T. pallidum</i> and determine its macrolide susceptibility via a culture-independent protocol.",2020-11-09
33166451,Identification of Small Molecule-miRNA Associations with Graph Regularization Techniques in Heterogeneous Networks.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are significant regulators of post-transcriptional levels and have been confirmed to be targeted by small molecule (SM) drugs. It is a novel insight to treat human diseases and accelerate drug discovery by targeting miRNA with small molecules. Computational approaches for discovering novel small molecule-miRNA associations by integrating more heterogeneous network information provide a new idea for the multiple node association prediction between small molecule-miRNA and small molecule-disease associations at a system level. In this study, we proposed a new computational model based on graph regularization techniques in heterogeneous networks, called identification of small molecule-miRNA associations with graph regularization techniques (SMMARTs), to discover potential small molecule-miRNA associations. The novelty of the model lies in the fact that the association score of a small molecule-miRNA pair is calculated by an iterative method in heterogeneous networks that incorporates small molecule-disease associations and miRNA-disease associations. The experimental results indicate that SMMART has better performance than several state-of-the-art methods in inferring small molecule-miRNA associations. Case studies further illustrate the effectiveness of SMMART for small molecule-miRNA association prediction.",2020-11-09
33151124,Gastrodin promotes CNS myelination via a lncRNA Gm7237/miR-142a/MRF pathway.,"Treatment of central nervous system (CNS) demyelination is greatly hindered by lack of the knowledge regarding to underlying molecular mechanisms as well as therapeutic agents. Here, we report a novel small molecule agent, gastrodin (GAS), which can significantly promote CNS myelination in <i>in vivo</i> mice models. By using high-throughput sequencing analysis, we discover a key long non-coding RNA Gm7237 that can enhance CNS myelination and is up-regulated by GAS. Through using bioinformatic analysis and experimental validations, we further unravel that microRNA-142a (miR-142a) and its target myelin gene regulatory factor (MRF) is under the direct regulation by Gm7237. Finally, we demonstrate that Gm7237/miR-142a/MRF axis is the key pathway involved in CNS myelination mediated by GAS. Overall, our results provide not only a novel agent for therapeutic treatment of CNS demyelination but also a molecular basis responsible for GAS-promoted CNS myelination.",2020-11-05
33133057,The Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Immunogenicity and Safety of the Tuberculosis Subunit Vaccines M72/AS01<sub>E</sub> and MVA85A.,"<b>Background:</b> Tuberculosis (TB) is a severe infectious disease with devastating effects on global public health. No TB vaccine has yet been approved for use on latent TB infections and healthy adults. In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the M72/AS01<sub>E</sub> and MVA85A subunit vaccines. The M72/AS01<sub>E</sub> is a novel peptide-based vaccine currently in progress, which may increase the protection level against TB infection. The MVA85A was a viral vector-based TB subunit vaccine being used in the clinical trials. The vaccines mentioned above have been studied in various phase I/II clinical trials. Immunogenicity and safety is the first consideration for TB vaccine development. <b>Methods:</b> The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for published studies (until October 2019) to find out information on the M72/AS01<sub>E</sub> and MVA85A candidate vaccines. The meta-analysis was conducted by applying the standard methods and processes established by the Cochrane Collaboration. <b>Results:</b> Five eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were selected for the meta-analysis of M72/AS01E candidate vaccines. The analysis revealed that the M72/AS01E subunit vaccine had an abundance of polyfunctional M72-specific CD4+ T cells [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.37] in the vaccine group versus the control group, the highest seropositivity rate [relative risk (RR) = 5.09]. The M72/AS01E vaccinated group were found to be at high risk of local injection site redness (RR = 2.64), headache (RR = 1.59), malaise (RR = 3.55), myalgia (RR = 2.27), fatigue (RR = 2.16), pain (RR = 3.99), swelling (RR = 5.09), and fever (RR = 2.04) compared to the control groups. The incidences of common adverse events of M72/AS01E were local injection site redness, headache, malaise, myalgia, fatigue, pain, swelling, fever, etc. Six eligible RCTs were selected for the meta-analysis on MVA85A candidate vaccines. The analysis revealed that the subunit vaccine MVA85A had a higher abundance of overall pooled proportion polyfunctional MVA85A-specific CD4+ T cells SMD = 2.41 in the vaccine group vs. the control group, with the highest seropositivity rate [estimation rate (ER) = 0.55]. The MVA85A vaccinated group were found to be at high risk of local injection site redness (ER = 0.55), headache (ER = 0.40), malaise (ER = 0.29), pain (ER = 0.54), myalgia (ER = 0.31), and fever (ER = 0.20). The incidences of common adverse events of MVA85A were local injection site redness, headache, malaise, pain, myalgia, fever, etc. <b>Conclusion:</b> The M72/AS01<sub>E</sub> and MVA85A vaccines against TB are safe and had immunogenicity in diverse clinical trials. The M72/AS01<sub>E</sub> and MVA85A vaccines are associated with a mild adverse reaction. The meta-analysis on immunogenicity and safety of M72/AS01<sub>E</sub> and MVA85A vaccines provides useful information for the evaluation of available subunit vaccines in the clinic.",2020-10-08
33124966,Development of a Peptide Derived from Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF-BB) into a Potential Drug Candidate for the Treatment of Wounds.,"<b>Objective:</b> This study evaluated the use of novel peptides derived from platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) as potential wound healing stimulants. One of the compounds (named PDGF2) was subjected for further research after cytotoxicity and proliferation assays on human skin cells. Further investigation included evaluation of: migration and chemotaxis of skin cells, immunological and allergic safety, the transcriptional analyses of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and dermal fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF2, and the use of dorsal skin wound injury model to evaluate the effect of wound healing in mice. <b>Approach:</b> Colorimetric lactate dehydrogenase and tetrazolium assays were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity and the effect on proliferation. PDGF2 effect on migration and chemotaxis was also checked. Immunological safety and allergic potential were evaluated with a lymphocyte activation and basophil activation test. Transcriptional profiles of ASCs and primary fibroblasts were assessed after stimulation with PDGF2. Eight-week-old BALB/c female mice were used for dorsal skin wound injury model. <b>Results:</b> PDGF2 showed low cytotoxicity, pro-proliferative effects on human skin cells, high immunological safety, and accelerated wound healing in mouse model. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of ASCs and fibroblasts revealed the activation of processes involved in wound healing and indicated its safety. <b>Innovation:</b> A novel peptide derived from PDGF-BB was proved to be safe drug candidate in wound healing. We also present a multifaceted <i>in vitro</i> model for the initial screening of new compounds that may be potentially useful in wound healing stimulation. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results show that peptide derived from PDGF-BB is a promising drug candidate for wound treatment.",2019-10-29
33124469,Antidepressant drug sertraline modulates AMPK-MTOR signaling-mediated autophagy via targeting mitochondrial VDAC1 protein.,"Macroautophagy/autophagy (hereafter autophagy), the process of mass degradation of unnecessary elements within the cell, is often dysregulated in many diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, autophagy modulating agents have a great potential to be therapeutic agents for the autophagy-related diseases. Here we report that an anti-depressant drug sertraline (Sert) is an autophagy-inducing agent. Mechanistically, Sert potentially binds to and antagonizes the mitochondrial VDAC1 (voltage dependent anion channel 1), resulting in reduced cellular ATP (adenosine triphosphate) level, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of its downstream, MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase)-RPS6KB1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1) signaling pathway. Cells lacking VDAC1 expression completely abrogate the modulatory effect of Sert on AMPK-MTOR pathway and autophagy-inducing activity. We further show that Sert suppresses tauopathy by promoting the autophagic degradation of MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau) protein via inducing autophagy. Our study demonstrates the potential of Sert as a novel small molecule autophagy-inducing agent and provides a new drug candidate to treat autophagy related diseases by targeting VDAC1.<b>Abbreviations:</b> AMP: adenosine monophosphate; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; Baf: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BiFC: biomolecular fluorescence complementation; CAMKK2/CAMKKB: calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinase 2; CC: compound C; DARTS: drug affinity responsive target stability; HUVECs: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; Inda: indatraline; STK11/LKB1: serine/threonine kinase 11; MAPT: microtubule associated protein tau; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; MEFs: mouse embryonic fibroblasts; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Rapa: rapamycin; Sert: sertraline; RPS6KB1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; SLC6A4/SERT1: solute carrier family 6 member 4; TFEB: transcription factor EB; VDAC1: voltage dependent anion channel 1; WT: wild-type; WM: wortmannin.",2020-11-09
33118348,Discovery of a Beetroot Protease Inhibitor to Identify and Classify Plant-Derived Cystine Knot Peptides.,"Plant peptide protease inhibitors are important molecules in seed storage metabolism and to fight insect pests. Commonly they contain multiple disulfide bonds and are exceptionally stable molecules. In this study, a novel peptide protease inhibitor from beetroot (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) termed bevuTI-I was isolated, and its primary structure was determined via mass spectrometry-based amino acid sequencing. By sequence homology analysis a few peptides with high similarity to bevuTI-I, also known as the <i>Mirabilis jalapa</i> trypsin inhibitor subfamily of knottin-type protease inhibitors, were discovered. Hence, we assessed bevuTI-I for inhibitory activity toward trypsin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 471 nM) and human prolyl oligopeptidase (IC<sub>50</sub> = 11 μM), which is an emerging drug target for neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders. Interestingly, using a customized bioinformatics approach, bevuTI-I was found to be the missing link to annotate 243 novel sequences of <i>M. jalapa</i> trypsin inhibitor-like peptides. According to their phylogenetic distribution they appear to be common in several plant families. Therefore, the presented approach and our results may help to discover and classify other plant-derived cystine knot peptides, a class of plant molecules that play important functions in plant physiology and are currently being explored as lead molecules and scaffolds in drug development.",2020-10-29
33117702,"MKI-1, a Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor of MASTL, Exerts Antitumor and Radiosensitizer Activities Through PP2A Activation in Breast Cancer.","Although MASTL (microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-like) is an attractive target for anticancer treatment, MASTL inhibitors with antitumor activity have not yet been reported. In this study, we have presented a novel MASTL inhibitor, MKI-1, identified through <i>in silico</i> screening and <i>in vitro</i> analysis. Our data revealed that MKI-1 exerted antitumor and radiosensitizer activities in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of breast cancer. The mechanism of action of MKI-1 occurred through an increase in PP2A activity, which subsequently decreased the c-Myc protein content in breast cancer cells. Moreover, the activity of MKI-1 in the regulation of MASTL-PP2A was validated in a mouse oocyte model. Our results have demonstrated a new small-molecule inhibitor of MASTL, MKI-1, which exerts antitumor and radiosensitizer activities through PP2A activation in breast cancer <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo.</i>",2020-09-29

33115824,Characterization of Negative Allosteric Modulators of the Calcium-Sensing Receptor for Repurposing as a Treatment of Asthma.,"Asthma is still an incurable disease, and there is a recognized need for novel small-molecule therapies for people with asthma, especially those poorly controlled by current treatments. We previously demonstrated that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), calcilytics, uniquely suppress both airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and inflammation in human cells and murine asthma surrogates. Here we assess the feasibility of repurposing four CaSR NAMs, which were originally developed for oral therapy for osteoporosis and previously tested in the clinic as a novel, single, and comprehensive topical antiasthma therapy. We address the hypotheses, using murine asthma surrogates, that topically delivered CaSR NAMs 1) abolish AHR; 2) are unlikely to cause unwanted systemic effects; 3) are suitable for topical application; and 4) inhibit airway inflammation to the same degree as the current standard of care, inhaled corticosteroids, and, furthermore, inhibit airway remodeling. All four CaSR NAMs inhibited poly-L-arginine-induced AHR in naïve mice and suppressed both AHR and airway inflammation in a murine surrogate of acute asthma, confirming class specificity. Repeated exposure to inhaled CaSR NAMs did not alter blood pressure, heart rate, or serum calcium concentrations. Optimal candidates for repurposing were identified based on anti-AHR/inflammatory activities, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, formulation, and micronization studies. Whereas both inhaled CaSR NAMs and inhaled corticosteroids reduced airways inflammation, only the former prevented goblet cell hyperplasia in a chronic asthma model. We conclude that inhaled CaSR NAMs are likely a single, safe, and effective topical therapy for human asthma, abolishing AHR, suppressing airways inflammation, and abrogating some features of airway remodeling. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) reduce airway smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness, reverse airway inflammation as efficiently as topical corticosteroids, and suppress airway remodeling in asthma surrogates. CaSR NAMs, which were initially developed for oral therapy of osteoporosis proved inefficacious for this indication despite being safe and well tolerated. Here we show that structurally unrelated CaSR NAMs are suitable for inhaled delivery and represent a one-stop, steroid-free approach to asthma control and prophylaxis.",2020-10-28
33114206,Crystal Structure of the Kinase Domain of MerTK in Complex with AZD7762 Provides Clues for Structure-Based Drug Development.,"Aberrant tyrosine-protein kinase Mer (MerTK) expression triggers prosurvival signaling and contributes to cell survival, invasive motility, and chemoresistance in many kinds of cancers. In addition, recent reports suggested that MerTK could be a primary target for abnormal platelet aggregation. Consequently, MerTK inhibitors may promote cancer cell death, sensitize cells to chemotherapy, and act as new antiplatelet agents. We screened an inhouse chemical library to discover novel small-molecule MerTK inhibitors, and identified AZD7762, which is known as a checkpoint-kinase (Chk) inhibitor. The inhibition of MerTK by AZD7762 was validated using an in vitro homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay and through monitoring the decrease in phosphorylated MerTK in two lung cancer cell lines. We also determined the crystal structure of the MerTK:AZD7762 complex and revealed the binding mode of AZD7762 to MerTK. Structural information from the MerTK:AZD7762 complex and its comparison with other MerTK:inhibitor structures gave us new insights for optimizing the development of inhibitors targeting MerTK.",2020-10-23
33110983,Machine Learning for Discovery of GSK3β Inhibitors.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 35 million people worldwide. The current treatment options for people with AD consist of drugs designed to slow the rate of decline in memory and cognition, but these treatments are not curative, and patients eventually suffer complete cognitive injury. With the substantial amounts of published data on targets for this disease, we proposed that machine learning software could be used to find novel small-molecule treatments that can supplement the AD drugs currently on the market. In order to do this, we used publicly available data in ChEMBL to build and validate Bayesian machine learning models for AD target proteins. The first AD target that we have addressed with this method is the serine-threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), which is a proline-directed serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates the microtubule-stabilizing protein tau. This phosphorylation prompts tau to dissociate from the microtubule and form insoluble oligomers called paired helical filaments, which are one of the components of the neurofibrillary tangles found in AD brains. Using our Bayesian machine learning model for GSK3β consisting of 2368 molecules, this model produced a five-fold cross validation ROC of 0.905. This model was also used for virtual screening of large libraries of FDA-approved drugs and clinical candidates. Subsequent testing of selected compounds revealed a selective small-molecule inhibitor, ruboxistaurin, with activity against GSK3β (avg IC<sub>50</sub> = 97.3 nM) and GSK3α (IC<sub>50</sub> = 695.9 nM). Several other structurally diverse inhibitors were also identified. We are now applying this machine learning approach to additional AD targets to identify approved drugs or clinical trial candidates that can be repurposed as AD therapeutics. This represents a viable approach to accelerate drug discovery and do so at a fraction of the cost of traditional high throughput screening.",2020-10-12
33097285,A Novel Small Molecule Targets NKCC1 To Restore Synaptic Inhibition.,"Finely tuned excitation-inhibition balance is essential for proper brain function, and loss of balance resulting from reduced synaptic inhibition is associated with neurological disorders. Savardi and colleagues have discovered a novel inhibitor of a cation-chloride transporter that is required for synaptic inhibition, and which restores behaviors associated with Down syndrome (DS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",2020-10-20
33087513,"ASR490, a Small Molecule, Overrides Aberrant Expression of <i>Notch1</i> in Colorectal Cancer.","<i>Notch1</i> activation triggers significant oncogenic signaling that manifests as enhanced metastatic potential and tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer. Novel small-molecule inhibitors, mainly plant-derived analogs, have low toxicity profiles and higher bioavailability. In this study, we have developed a small molecule, ASR490, by modifying structure of naturally occurring compound Withaferin A. ASR490 showed a growth-inhibitory potential by downregulating <i>Notch1</i> signaling in HCT116 and SW620 cell lines. Docking studies and thermal shift assays confirmed that ASR490 binds to <i>Notch1</i>, whereas no changes in <i>Notch2</i> and <i>Notch3</i> expression were seen in colorectal cancer cells. <i>Notch1</i> governs epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition signaling and is responsible for metastasis, which was abolished by ASR490 treatment. To further confirm the therapeutic potential of ASR490, we stably overexpressed <i>Notch1</i> in HCT-116 cells and determined its inhibitory potential in transfected colorectal cancer (Notch1/HCT116) cells. ASR490 effectively prevented cell growth in both the vector (<i>P</i> = 0.005) and <i>Notch1</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.05) transfectants. The downregulation of <i>Notch1</i> signaling was evident, which corresponded with downregulation of mesenchymal markers, including <i>N-cadherin</i> and <i>β-catenin</i> and induction of <i>E-cadherin</i> in HCT-116 transfectants. Intraperitoneal administration of a 1% MTD dose of ASR490 (5 mg/kg) effectively suppressed the tumor growth in control (pCMV/HCT116) and Notch1/HCT116 in xenotransplanted mice. In addition, downregulation of <i>Notch1</i> and survival signaling in ASR-treated tumors confirmed the <i>in vitro</i> results. In conclusion, ASR490 appears to be a potent agent that can inhibit <i>Notch1</i> signaling in colorectal cancer.",2020-10-21
33082422,Targeting c-Myc with a novel Peptide Nuclear Delivery Device.,"Biologics such as peptides and antibodies are a well-established class of therapeutics. However, their intracellular delivery remains problematic. In particular, methods to efficiently inhibit intra-nuclear targets are lacking. We previously described that Pseudomonas Exotoxin A reaches the nucleoplasm via the endosomes-to-nucleus trafficking pathway. Here, we show that a non-toxic truncated form of PE can be coupled to peptides and efficiently reach the nucleoplasm. It can be used as a Peptide Nuclear Delivery Device (PNDD) to deliver polypeptidic cargos as large as Glutathione- S-transferase (GST) to the nucleus. PNDD1 is a fusion of PNDD to the c-myc inhibitor peptide H1. PNDD1 is able to inhibit c-Myc dependent transcription at nanomolar concentration. In contrast, H1 fused to various cell-penetrating peptides are active only in the micromolar range. PNDD1 attenuates cell proliferation and induces cell death in various tumor cell lines. In particular, several patient-derived Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas cell lines die after exposure to PNDD1, while normal B-cells survive. Altogether, our data indicate that PNDD is a powerful tool to bring active cargo to the nucleus and PNDD1 could be the basis of a new therapy against lymphoma.",2020-10-20
33077662,Small-Molecule Antibiotics Inhibiting tRNA-Regulated Gene Expression Is a Viable Strategy for Targeting Gram-Positive Bacteria.,"Bacterial infections and the rise of antibiotic resistance, especially multidrug resistance, have generated a clear need for discovery of novel therapeutics. We demonstrated that a small-molecule drug, PKZ18, targets the T-box mechanism and inhibits bacterial growth. The T-box is a structurally conserved riboswitch-like gene regulator in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of numerous essential genes of Gram-positive bacteria. T-boxes are stabilized by cognate, unacylated tRNA ligands, allowing the formation of an antiterminator hairpin in the mRNA that enables transcription of the gene. In the absence of an unacylated cognate tRNA, transcription is halted due to the formation of a thermodynamically more stable terminator hairpin. PKZ18 targets the site of the codon-anticodon interaction of the conserved stem I and reduces T-box-controlled gene expression. Here, we show that novel analogs of PKZ18 have improved MICs, bactericidal effects against methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), and increased efficacy in nutrient-limiting conditions. The analogs have reduced cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells compared to PKZ18. The PKZ18 analogs acted synergistically with aminoglycosides to significantly enhance the efficacy of the analogs and aminoglycosides, further increasing their therapeutic windows. RNA sequencing showed that the analog PKZ18-22 affects expression of 8 of 12 T-box controlled genes in a statistically significant manner, but not other 5'-UTR regulated genes in MRSA. Very low levels of resistance further support the existence of multiple T-box targets for PKZ18 analogs in the cell. Together, the multiple targets, low resistance, and synergy make PKZ18 analogs promising drugs for development and future clinical applications.",2020-12-16
33075488,"Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of N-arylpiperazine derivatives as interferon inducers.","Type I Interferon (IFN) signaling plays an important role in the immune defense system against virus infection and in the innate immune response, thus IFNs are widely used as anti-viral agents and treatment for immune disorder or cancer. However, there is a growing demand for novel small-molecule IFN inducer due to tolerance, toxicity, or short duration of action following direct administration of IFNs. In this study, we assessed arylpiperazine (ARP) as a new core skeleton of IFN inducer. To investigate structure-activity relationship, we designed and synthesized a series of ARP analogues and evaluated the ability to stimulate IFN response in THP-1 human monocyte cells. Compound 5i was identified as a potent type I IFN inducer as it significantly increased cytokine secretion and increased expression of various IFN-stimulating genes which are representative biomarkers of type I IFN pathway. Our results suggested a beneficial therapeutic potential of 5i as an anti-viral agent.",2020-10-16
33072738,Upregulation of Mcl-1S Causes Cell-Cycle Perturbations and DNA Damage Accumulation.,"As an important regulator of apoptosis, Mcl-1 protein, a member of the Bcl-2 family, represents an attractive target for cancer treatment. The recent development of novel small molecule compounds has allowed Mcl-1-inhibitory therapy to proceed to clinical trials in cancer treatment. However, the possible adverse effects of either direct inhibition of Mcl-1 or upregulation of Mcl-1S, proapoptotic isoform resulting from alternative splicing of Mcl-1, remain unclear. Here, we investigated changes in Mcl-1S levels during cell cycle and the cell cycle-related functions of Mcl-1 isoforms to address the above-mentioned concerns. It was shown that an anti-mitotic agent monastrol caused accumulation of Mcl-1S mRNA, although without increasing the protein level. In contrast, both mRNA and protein levels of Mcl-1S accrued during the premitotic stages of the normal cell cycle progression. Importantly, Mcl-1S was observed in the nuclear compartment and an overexpression of Mcl-1S, as well as knockdown of Mcl-1, accelerated the progression of cells into mitosis and resulted in DNA damage accumulation. Surprisingly, a small molecule inhibitor of Mcl-1, BH3-mimetic S63845, did not affect the cell cycle progression or the amount of DNA damage. In general, upregulated Mcl-1S protein or genetically inhibited Mcl-1L were associated with the cell cycle perturbations and DNA damage accumulation in normal and cancer cells. At the same time, BH3-mimetic to Mcl-1 did not affect the cell cycle progression, suggesting that direct inhibition of Mcl-1 is devoid of cell-cycle related undesired effects.",2020-09-25
33072093,Strategies for Targeting SARS CoV-2: Small Molecule Inhibitors-The Current Status.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced Coronavirus Disease - 19 (COVID-19) cases have been increasing at an alarming rate (7.4 million positive cases as on June 11 2020), causing high mortality (4,17,956 deaths as on June 11 2020) and economic loss (a 3.2% shrink in global economy in 2020) across 212 countries globally. The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, in this review, we have reviewed structural features of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of NSMIs.",2020-09-18
33069101,"BPRDP056, a novel small molecule drug conjugate specifically targeting phosphatidylserine for cancer therapy.","Zinc(II)-dipicolylamine (Zn-DPA) has been shown to specifically identify and bind to phosphatidylserine (PS), which exists in bulk in the tumor microenvironment. BPRDP056, a Zn-DPA-SN38 conjugate was designed to provide PS-targeted drug delivery of a cytotoxic SN38 to the tumor microenvironment, thereby allowing a lower dosage of SN38 that induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Micro-Western assay showed that BPRDP056 exhibited apoptotic signal levels similar to those of CPT-11 in the treated tumors growing in mice. Pharmacokinetic study showed that BPRDP056 has excellent systemic stability in circulation in mice and rats. BPRDP056 is accumulated in tumors and thus increases the cytotoxic effects of SN38. The in vivo antitumor activities of BPRDP056 have been shown to be significant in subcutaneous pancreas, prostate, colon, liver, breast, and glioblastoma tumors, included an orthotopic pancreatic tumor, in mice. BPRDP056 shrunk tumors at a lower (~20% only) dosing intensity of SN38 compared to that of SN38 conjugated in CPT-11 in all tumor models tested. A wide spectrum of antitumor activities is expected to treat all cancer types of PS-rich tumor microenvironments. BPRDP056 is a first-in-class small molecule drug conjugate for cancer therapy.",2020-10-14
33061944,Pharmacological Effects of Novel Peptide Drugs on Allergic Rhinitis at the Small Ribonucleic Acids Level.,"Using an allergic rhinitis (AR) model, we evaluated the pharmacological effects of novel peptide drugs (P-ONE and P-TWO) at the small RNA (sRNA) level. Using high-throughput sequencing, we assessed the sRNA expression profile of the negative control, AR antagonist (positive control), P-ONE, and P-TWO groups. By functional clustering and Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses, we found that sRNA target genes have a specific enrichment pattern and may contribute to the effects of the novel peptides. Small RNA sequencing confirmed the biological foundations of novel and traditional AR treatments and suggested unique pharmacological effects. Our findings will facilitate evaluation of the pathogenesis of AR and of the pharmacological mechanisms of novel peptide drugs.",2020-09-11
33060681,Discovery of a CNS penetrant small molecule SMN2 splicing modulator with improved tolerability for spinal muscular atrophy.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease, typically resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Nusinersen/SPINRAZA, a splice-switching oligonucleotide that modulates SMN2 (a paralog of SMN1) splicing and consequently increases SMN protein levels, has a therapeutic effect for SMA. Previously reported small-molecule SMN2 splicing modulators such as risdiplam/EVRYSDI and its analog SMN-C3 modulate not only the splicing of SMN2 but also that of secondary splice targets, including forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1). Through screening SMA patient-derived fibroblasts, a novel small molecule, designated TEC-1, was identified that selectively modulates SMN2 splicing over three secondary splice targets. TEC-1 did not strongly affect the splicing of FOXM1, and unlike risdiplam, did not induce micronucleus formation. In addition, TEC-1 showed higher selectively on galactosylceramidase and huntingtin gene expression compared to previously reported compounds (e.g., SMN-C3) due to off-target effects on cryptic exon inclusion and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Moreover, TEC-1 significantly ameliorated the disease phenotype in an SMA murine model in vivo. Thus, TEC-1 may have promising therapeutic potential for SMA, and our study demonstrates the feasibility of RNA-targeting small-molecule drug development with an improved tolerability profile.",2020-10-15
33043190,Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor for the Oncogenic Tyrosine Phosphatase SHP2 with Anti-Breast Cancer Cell Effects.,"The oncogenic property of the Src homology phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is well-known, but developing specific inhibitors has been very difficult. Based on our previous reports that showed the importance of acidic residues surrounding SHP2 substrate phosphotyrosines for specific recognition, we have rationally designed and chemically synthesized a small-molecule SHP2 inhibitor named 4,4'-(4'-carboxy)-4-nonyloxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,5-diyl)dibutanoic acid (CNBDA). Molecular modeling predicted that CNBDA packs well into the SHP2 active site and makes extended interactions primarily with positively charged and polar amino acids surrounding the active site. <i>In vitro</i> PTPase assays showed that CNBDA inhibits SHP2 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5 μM. However, the IC<sub>50</sub> of CNBDA toward SHP1, the close structural homologue of SHP2, was 125 μM, suggesting an approximately 25-fold effectiveness against SHP2 than SHP1. Because SHP2 is known for its positive role in breast cancer (BC) cell biology, we tested the effect of SHP2 inhibition with CNBDA in HER2-positive BC cells. Treatment with CNBDA suppressed cell proliferation in 2D culture, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and mammosphere (tumorisphere) formation in suspension cultures in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, CNBDA inhibited EGF-induced signaling and expression of HER2 by inhibiting the PTPase activity of SHP2 in BC cells. These findings suggest that CNBDA is a promising anti-SHP2 lead compound with anti-BC cell effects.",2020-09-25
33040403,Functional selective FPR1 signaling in favor of an activation of the neutrophil superoxide generating NOX2 complex.,"The formyl peptide receptors FPR1 and FPR2 are abundantly expressed by neutrophils, in which they regulate proinflammatory tissue recruitment of inflammatory cells, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and resolution of inflammatory reactions. The unique dual functionality of the FPRs makes them attractive targets to develop FPR-based therapeutics as novel anti-inflammatory treatments. The small compound RE-04-001 has earlier been identified as an inducer of ROS in differentiated HL60 cells but the precise target and the mechanism of action of the compound was has until now not been elucidated. In this study, we reveal that RE-04-001 specifically targets and activates FPR1, and the concentrations needed to activate the neutrophil NADPH-oxidase was very low (EC<sub>50</sub> ∼1 nM). RE-04-001 was also found to be a neutrophil chemoattractant, but when compared to the prototype FPR1 agonist N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), the concentrations required were comparably high, suggesting that signaling downstream of the RE-04-001-activated-FPR1 is functionally selective. In addition, the RE-04-001-induced response was strongly biased toward the PLC-PIP<sub>2</sub> -Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway and ERK1/2 activation but away from β-arrestin recruitment. Compared to the peptide agonist fMLF, RE-04-001 is more resistant to inactivation by the MPO-H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -halide system. In summary, this study describes RE-04-001 as a novel small molecule agonist specific for FPR1, which displays a biased signaling profile that leads to a functional selective activating of human neutrophils. RE-04-001 is, therefore, a useful tool, not only for further mechanistic studies of the regulatory role of FPR1 in inflammation in vitro and in vivo, but also for developing FPR1-specific drug therapeutics.",2020-10-11
33039566,Androstano-arylpyrimidines: Novel small molecule inhibitors of MDR1 for sensitizing multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells.,"Apart from the numerous physiological functions of MDR1, it is widely known for its role in granting multidrug resistance to cancer cells. This ATP-driven transmembrane protein exports a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells, thereby deterring drugs to reach effective intracellular concentrations. Thus, inhibition of MDR1 expression or function would be a viable option to enhance the accumulation of cytotoxic agents in cancer cells which in turn could improve significantly the success rate of chemotherapy. Although, several pharmacological inhibitors have been designed and tested in the past, due to their unsuccessful translation to clinical application, there is still ongoing research to find suitable compounds to manipulate MDR1 function and potentially overturn multidrug resistance. In the present study, we demonstrate that novel DHT-derived A-ring-fused arylpyrimidinone derivatives, based on their acetylation status, can inhibit MDR1 efflux activity in MDR1 overexpressing multidrug-resistant breast adenocarcinoma cells. Strikingly, all derivatives carrying an acetoxy group on the sterane d-ring were highly potent in hindering Rhodamine 123 export via MDR1, however deacetylated molecules were not capable to exert a similar effect on multidrug resistant cancer cells. The possible molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the efflux pump inhibiting function of acetylated derivatives were dissected using the most potent MDR1 inhibitor, compound 10g and its deacetylated counterpart (11g). Importantly, molecule 10g was able to sensitize drug resistant cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, further verifying the highly advantageous nature of efflux pump inhibition upon chemotherapy. Our experiments also revealed that neither mitochondrial damage, nor MDR1 gene regulation could lay behind the MDR1 inhibitory function of compound 10g. Molecular docking studies were carried out to analyze the interactions of 10g and 11g with MDR1, however no significant differences in their binding properties were observed. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the ER stress inducing potential of molecule 10g might be the fundamental mechanism behind its inhibitory action on MDR1. With additional studies, our work can yield a structural platform for a new generation of small molecule MDR1 inhibitors to sensitize drug resistant cancer cells and at the same time it elucidates the exemplary involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the molecular events to defeat multidrug resistance.",2020-10-08
33037737,Efficacy of the novel tubulin polymerization inhibitor PTC-028 for myelodysplastic syndrome.,"Monomer tubulin polymerize into microtubules, which are highly dynamic and play a critical role in mitosis. Therefore, microtubule dynamics are an important target for anticancer drugs. The inhibition of tubulin polymerization or depolymerization was previously targeted and exhibited efficacy against solid tumors. The novel small molecule PTC596 directly binds tubulin, inhibits microtubule polymerization, downregulates MCL-1, and induces p53-independent apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells. We herein investigated the efficacy of PTC-028, a structural analog of PTC596, for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PTC-028 suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in MDS cell lines. The efficacy of PTC028 in primary MDS samples was confirmed using cell proliferation assays. PTC-028 synergized with hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine and azacitidine, to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in MDS cells. Mechanistically, a treatment with PTC-028 induced G2/M arrest followed by apoptotic cell death. We also assessed the efficacy of PTC-028 in a xenograft mouse model of MDS using the MDS cell line, MDS-L, and the AkaBLI bioluminescence imaging system, which is composed of AkaLumine-HCl and Akaluc. PTC-028 prolonged the survival of mice in xenograft models. The present results suggest a chemotherapeutic strategy for MDS through the disruption of microtubule dynamics in combination with DNA hypomethylating agents.",2020-11-02
33033726,Use of the Intratumoural Anticancer Drug Tigilanol Tiglate in Two Horses.,"Tigilanol tiglate is a novel small molecule approved as a veterinary pharmaceutical in Europe for intratumoural treatment of non-metastatic, non-resectable canine mast cell tumors. The drug has a ""tumor agnostic"" mode of action associated with induction of an acute inflammatory response at the treatment site, immune cell recruitment, and disruption of tumor vasculature. Consequently, tigilanol tiglate has potential in treating a range of tumor types in humans and companion animals. However, it is likely that species-specific dosing and concomitant medication protocols will be required, especially to manage the drug-induced acute inflammatory response at the treatment site. As an initial step in evaluating tigilanol tiglate for treating cutaneous tumors in horses, we developed an equine-specific protocol involving (a) a 30% reduction in intratumoural tigilanol tiglate dose rate compared to that used in dogs, and (b) a regime of concomitant medications to manage the drug-induced acute inflammatory response at the treatment site. Here we report a preliminary study in two horses using the protocol to treat (i) an aggressive fibroblastic sarcoid that had recurred following surgical excision and (ii) a fast-growing peri-ocular squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical response to tigilanol tiglate treatment in these cases was similar to that observed in canine and human patients. Localized inflammation and bruising developed rapidly at the treatment site with haemorrhagic necrosis of the tumor evident within 24 h. Slough of necrotic tumor mass occurred within 6-16 days followed by infill of the tissue defect and full re-epithelialisation of the treatment site with good functional outcome. Drug-induced inflammation and oedema at the treatment site were well controlled by the concomitant medications and largely resolved within 3 days, while the wound that formed following tumor slough healed uneventfully. Both patients displayed minor lethargy during the first 36 h after treatment and localized treatment-site discomfort was apparent over the first 3-5 days. There was no evidence of recurrence of the sarcoid at 93 days, or the squamous cell carcinoma at 189 days. The results from this study support continued development and evaluation of tigilanol tiglate as a potential future treatment option for cutaneous equine tumors.",2020-09-09
33028632,Inhibition of the SUV4-20 H1 histone methyltransferase increases frataxin expression in Friedreich's ataxia patient cells.,"The molecular mechanisms of reduced frataxin (<i>FXN</i>) expression in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) are linked to epigenetic modification of the <i>FXN</i> locus caused by the disease-associated GAA expansion. Here, we identify that SUV4-20 histone methyltransferases, specifically SUV4-20 H1, play an important role in the regulation of FXN expression and represent a novel therapeutic target. Using a human <i>FXN</i>-GAA-Luciferase repeat expansion genomic DNA reporter model of FRDA, we screened the Structural Genomics Consortium epigenetic probe collection. We found that pharmacological inhibition of the SUV4-20 methyltransferases by the tool compound A-196 increased the expression of FXN by ∼1.5-fold in the reporter cell line. In several FRDA cell lines and patient-derived primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, A-196 increased FXN expression by up to 2-fold, an effect not seen in WT cells. SUV4-20 inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 and an increase in H4K20me1, but only modest (1.4-7.8%) perturbation in genome-wide expression was observed. Finally, based on the structural activity relationship and crystal structure of A-196, novel small molecule A-196 analogs were synthesized and shown to give a 20-fold increase in potency for increasing <i>FXN</i> expression. Overall, our results suggest that histone methylation is important in the regulation of <i>FXN</i> expression and highlight SUV4-20 H1 as a potential novel therapeutic target for FRDA.",2020-10-07

33026147,Novel peptide derived from IGF-2 displays anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and inhibits retinal angiogenesis in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy.,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a major cause of significant visual morbidity and blindness in preterm infants, is closely related to pathological angiogenesis. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a new 12-aa peptide (named peptide CW-703) from human insulin-like growth factor-2, against angiogenesis in ROP.",2020-10-19
33007287,Cryoprotectant-dependent control of intracellular ice recrystallization in hepatocytes using small molecule carbohydrate derivatives.,"To promote the recovery of cells that undergo intracellular ice formation (IIF), it is imperative that the recrystallization of intracellular ice is minimized. Hepatocytes are more prone to IIF than most mammalian cells, and thus we assessed the ability of novel small molecule carbohydrate-based ice recrystallization inhibitors (IRIs) to permeate and function within hepatocytes. HepG2 monolayers were treated with N-(4-chlorophenyl)-d-gluconamide (IRI 1), N-(2-fluorophenyl)-d-gluconamide (IRI 2), or para-methoxyphenyl-β-D-glycoside (IRI 3) and fluorescent cryomicroscopy was used for real time visualization of intracellular ice recrystallization. Both IRI 2 and IRI 3 reduced rates of intracellular recrystallization, whereas IRI 1 did not. IRI 2 and IRI 3, however, demonstrated a marked reduction in efficiency in the presence of the most frequently used permeating cryoprotectants (CPAs): glycerol, propylene glycol (PG), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and ethylene glycol (EG). Nevertheless, IRI 3 reduced rates of intracellular recrystallization relative to CPA-only controls in the presence of glycerol, PG, and DMSO. Interestingly, IRI preparation in trehalose, a commonly used non-permeating CPA, did not impact the activity of IRI 3. However, trehalose did increase the activity of IRI 1 while decreasing that of IRI 2. While this study suggests that each of these compounds could prove relevant in hepatocyte cryopreservation protocols where IIF would be prominent, CPA-mediated modulation of intracellular IRI activity is apparent and warrants further investigation.",2020-09-29
33002342,New small-molecule compound Hu-17 inhibits estrogen biosynthesis by aromatase in human ovarian granulosa cancer cells.,"Estrogen-dependent cancers (breast, endometrial, and ovarian) are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. Aromatase is the main enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogen, which drives proliferation, and antiestrogens can inhibit the growth of these estrogen-dependent cancers. Hu-17, an aromatase inhibitor, is a novel small-molecule compound that suppresses viability of and promotes apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, this study aimed to predict targets of Hu-17 and assess its intracellular signaling in ovarian cancer cells. Using the Similarity Ensemble Approach software to predict the potential mechanism of Hu-17 and combining phospho-proteome arrays with western blot analysis, we observed that Hu-17 could inhibit the ERK pathway, resulting in reduced estrogen synthesis in KGN cells, a cell line derived from a patient with invasive ovarian granulosa cell carcinoma. Hu-17 reduced the expression of CYP19A1 mRNA, responsible for producing aromatase, by suppressing the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding-1. Hu-17 also accelerated aromatase protein degradation but had no effect on aromatase activity. Therefore, Hu-17 could serve as a potential treatment for estrogen-dependent cancers albeit further investigation is warranted.",2020-10-01
32997432,Durable efficacy of anlotinib in a patient with advanced thymic squamous cell carcinoma after multiline chemotherapy and apatinib: A case report and literature review.,"Thymic carcinoma is a rare and highly aggressive mediastinal tumor. Most patients are diagnosed at surgically unresectable stages. Current prospective and retrospective studies have indicated that platinum and anthracycline-based chemotherapy are the first choice drugs of first-line therapy for advanced thymic carcinoma. However, there is no optimal treatment after progression for patients who have undergone first-line and subsequent chemotherapy. Anlotinib, a novel small molecule tyrosine kinase multitarget inhibitor, was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration as a third-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in May 2018. Herein we report a case of an advanced thymic squamous cell carcinoma patient harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion who had previously received multiline therapy, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy as well as antiangiogenic therapy. Also as an angiogenesis inhibitor, anotinib had controlled his mediastinal mass after failure of the apatinib treatment. To date, over 23 months of progression-free survival (PFS) and six years of overall survival (OS) have been achieved. Compared with apatinib, the adverse reactions have been mild and tolerable and the patient's quality of life has improved. To our knowledge, this is the first report where anlotinib has been effective in controlling the progression of thymic carcinoma. In the multiline treatment of advanced thymic carcinoma, anlotinib appears to show great potential when utilized as a salvage treatment.",2020-09-30

32986987,Control of ice recrystallization in liver tissues using small molecule carbohydrate derivatives.,"Minimizing ice recrystallization injury in tissues and organs has historically been sought using biological antifreeze proteins. However, the size of these compounds can limit permeation and their potential immunogenicity disqualifies them from use in several cryopreservation applications. Novel small molecule carbohydrate-derived ice recrystallization inhibitors (IRIs) are not subject to these constraints, and thus we sought to evaluate the ability of a highly active IRI to permeate liver tissue and control recrystallization. Rat liver tissue blocks (0.5 mm<sup>2</sup>) were incubated with the IRI for 6 h at 22 °C and subsequently plunged in liquid nitrogen. Ice crystals within the tissue were fixed using a formal acetic alcohol fixative as it was rewarmed from -80 °C to 22 °C over the course of 48 h. The untreated control demonstrated a gradient of increasing crystal size from the exterior to the interior region of the tissue; however, the IRI-treated condition had no such gradient and exhibited small crystals throughout. Threshold segmentation confirmed a significant reduction in the ice crystal size within the interior region of the IRI-treated condition, suggesting the IRI permeated throughout and effectively controlled recrystallization within the tissue.",2020-09-25
32980814,Activation of Naturally Occurring Lecithin:Cholesterol Acyltransferase Mutants by a Novel Activator Compound.,"Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is a unique plasma enzyme able to esterify cholesterol, and it plays an important role in HDL maturation and promotion of reverse cholesterol transport. Familial LCAT deficiency (FLD; OMIM number 245900) is a rare recessive disease that results from loss-of-function mutations in the <i>LCAT</i> gene and has no cure. In this study, we assessed the in vitro efficacy of a novel small-molecule LCAT activator. Cholesterol esterification rate (CER) and LCAT activity were tested in plasma from six controls and five FLD homozygous carriers of various <i>LCAT</i> mutations at different doses of the compound (0.1, 1, and 10 µg/ml). In control plasma, the compound significantly increased both CER (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and LCAT activity (<i>P</i> = 0.007) in a dose-dependent manner. Both CER and LCAT activity increased by 4- to 5-fold, reaching maximum activation at the dose of 1 µg/ml. Interestingly, Daiichi Sankyo compound produced an increase in CER in two of the five tested LCAT mutants (Leu372--Arg and Val309--Met), while LCAT activity increased in three LCAT mutants (Arg147--Trp, Thr274--Ile and Leu372--Arg); mutant Pro254--Ser was not activated at any of the tested doses. The present findings form the basis for personalized therapeutic interventions in FLD carriers and support the potential LCAT activation in secondary LCAT defects. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We characterized the pharmacology of a novel small-molecule LCAT activator in vitro on a subset of naturally occurring LCAT mutants. Our findings form the basis for personalized therapeutic interventions for familial LCAT deficiency carriers, who can face severe complications and for whom no cure exists.",2020-09-26
32960053,"Discovery and Characterization of BAY 1214784, an Orally Available Spiroindoline Derivative Acting as a Potent and Selective Antagonist of the Human Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor as Proven in a First-In-Human Study in Postmenopausal Women.","The growth of uterine fibroids is sex hormone-dependent and commonly associated with highly incapacitating symptoms. Most treatment options consist of the control of these hormonal effects, ultimately blocking proliferative estrogen signaling (<i>i.e.</i>, oral contraceptives/antagonization of human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor [hGnRH-R] activity). Full hGnRH-R blockade, however, results in menopausal symptoms and affects bone mineralization, thus limiting treatment duration or demanding estrogen add-back approaches. To overcome such issues, we aimed to identify novel, small-molecule hGnRH-R antagonists. This led to the discovery of compound BAY 1214784, an orally available, potent, and selective hGnRH-R antagonist. Altering the geminal dimethylindoline core of the initial hit compound to a spiroindoline system significantly improved GnRH-R antagonist potencies across several species, mandatory for a successful compound optimization <i>in vivo</i>. In a first-in-human study in postmenopausal women, once daily treatment with BAY 1214784 effectively lowered plasma luteinizing hormone levels by up to 49%, at the same time being associated with low pharmacokinetic variability and good tolerability.",2020-10-06

32958248,Liposome-encapsulated peptide PDBSN ameliorates high-fat-diet-induced obesity and improves metabolism homeostasis.,"In recent years, the obese and overweight population has increased rapidly, which has become a worldwide public health problem. However, effective medication is lacking. Our previous study identified a novel peptide, PDBSN (GLSVADLAESIMKNL), that could significantly restrict adipocyte differentiation in vitro, but its in vivo function has not been determined. Thus, in this study, we encapsulated the peptide into liposomes attached with two ligands (visceral-adipose-tissue-targeting peptide and cell-penetrating peptide) to improve stability and specificity. We then tested the peptide's function in HFD (high-fat diet)-induced obese mice and found that PDBSN could reduce weight gain and improve insulin resistance as well as lipid homeostasis. These results suggest that PDBSN may be a potential candidate for anti-obesity drug discovery.",2020-09-18
32949707,Affinity purification of human alpha galactosidase utilizing a novel small molecule biomimetic of alpha-D-galactose.,"Alpha galactosidase (a-Gal) is an acidic hydrolase that plays a critical role in hydrolyzing the terminal alpha-galactoyl moiety from glycolipids and glycoproteins. There are over a hundred mutations reported for the GLA gene that encodes a-Gal that result in reduced protein synthesis, protein instability, and reduction in function. The deficiencies of a-Gal can cause Fabry disease, a rare lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by the failure to catabolize alpha-d-galactoyl glycolipid moieties. The current standard of care for Fabry disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) where the purified recombinant form of human a-Gal is given to patients. The manufacture of a-Gal is currently performed utilizing traditional large-scale chromatography processes. Developing an affinity resin for the purification of a-Gal would reduce the complexity of the manufacturing process, reduce costs, and potentially produce a higher quality a-Gal. After the evaluation of many small molecules, a commercially available small molecule biomimetic, N-5-Carboxypentyl-1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (N5C-DGJ), was utilized for the development of a novel small molecule biomimetic affinity resin for a-Gal. Affinity purified a-Gal demonstrated a purity greater than 90%, exhibited expected thermal stability and specific activity. Complementing this affinity purification is the development of an elution buffer system that confers an increased thermal stability to a-Gal. The N5C-DGJ affinity resin tolerated sodium hydroxide sanitization with no loss of binding capacity, making it amenable to large scale purification processes and potential use in manufacturing. This novel method for purifying the challenging a-Gal enzyme can be extended to other enzyme replacement therapies.",2020-09-16
32947941,Inhibition of DNA Repair Pathways and Induction of ROS Are Potential Mechanisms of Action of the Small Molecule Inhibitor BOLD-100 in Breast Cancer.,"BOLD-100, a ruthenium-based complex, sodium trans-[tetrachloridobis (1H-indazole) ruthenate (III)] (also known as IT-139, NKP1339 or KP1339), is a novel small molecule drug that demonstrated a manageable safety profile at the maximum tolerated dose and modest antitumor activity in a phase I clinical trial. BOLD-100 has been reported to inhibit the upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress sensing protein GRP78. However, response to BOLD-100 varies in different cancer models and the precise mechanism of action in high-response versus low-response cancer cells remains unclear. In vitro studies have indicated that BOLD-100 induces cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects as a monotherapy. To understand BOLD-100-mediated signaling mechanism in breast cancer cells, we used estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF7 breast cancer cells to obtain gene-metabolite integrated models. At 100 μM, BOLD-100 significantly reduced cell proliferation and expression of genes involved in the DNA repair pathway. BOLD-100 also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of histone H2AX, gamma-H2AX (Ser139), suggesting disruption of proper DNA surveillance. In estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer cells, combination of BOLD-100 with a PARP inhibitor, olaparib, induced significant inhibition of cell growth and xenografts and increased gamma-H2AX. Thus, BOLD-100 is a novel DNA repair pathway targeting agent and can be used with other chemotherapies in ER- breast cancer.",2020-09-16
32945122,Fabrication and evaluation of nanocontainers for lipophilic anticancer drug delivery in 3D in vitro model.,"Presently, most of anticancer drugs are high toxic for normal cells and, and as a result, they have severe side effects. Moreover, most of the formulations are lipophilic and have poor selectivity. To overcome these limitations, various drug delivery systems could be proposed. The aim of the current study was to fabricate novel polysaccharide nanocontainers (NC) by one-step ultrasonication technique and to evaluate their accumulation efficacy and cytotoxicity in 2D (monolayer culture) and 3D (tumor spheroids) in vitro models. NC with mean sizes in a range of 340-420 nm with the core-shell structure are synthetized and characterized. The NC shell is composed from diethylaminoethyl dextran/xanthan gum polyelectrolyte complex, while the hydrophobic core was loaded with the lipophilic anticancer drug thymoquinone. To enhance NC accumulation in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, the NC surface was modified with poly-L-lysine (PLL) or polyethylene glycol. Cell uptake of the NC loaded with Nile Red into the tumor cells was investigated by laser scanning confocal microscopy, fluorescent flow cytometry and fluorimetry. Modification of the NC with PLL allowed to obtain the optimal drug delivery system with maximal cytotoxicity, which was tested by MTT-test. The developed NC are promising for lipophilic anticancer drug delivery.",2020-09-17
32938616,Spliced Peptides and Cytokine-Driven Changes in the Immunopeptidome of Melanoma.,"Antigen recognition by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is governed by the pool of peptide antigens presented on the cell surface in the context of HLA class I complexes. Studies have shown not only a high degree of plasticity in the immunopeptidome, but also that a considerable fraction of all presented peptides is generated through proteasome-mediated splicing of noncontiguous regions of proteins to form novel peptide antigens. Here, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry combined with new bioinformatic approaches to characterize the immunopeptidome of melanoma cells in the presence or absence of IFNγ. In total, we identified more than 60,000 peptides from a single patient-derived cell line (LM-MEL-44) and demonstrated that IFNγ induced changes in the peptidome, with an overlap of only approximately 50% between basal and treated cells. Around 6% to 8% of the peptides were identified as <i>cis</i>-spliced peptides, and 2,213 peptides (1,827 linear and 386 <i>cis</i>-spliced peptides) were derived from known melanoma-associated antigens. These peptide antigens were equally distributed between the constitutive- and IFNγ-induced peptidome. We next examined additional HLA-matched patient-derived cell lines to investigate how frequently these peptides were identified and found that a high proportion of both linear and spliced peptides was conserved between individual patient tumors, drawing on data amassing to more than 100,000 peptide sequences. Several of these peptides showed <i>in vitro</i> immunogenicity across multiple patients with melanoma. These observations highlight the breadth and complexity of the repertoire of immunogenic peptides that can be exploited therapeutically and suggest that spliced peptides are a major class of tumor antigens.",2020-09-16
32936638,Di-bromo-Based Small-Molecule Inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint.,"Immune checkpoint blockade is one of the most promising strategies of cancer immunotherapy. However, unlike classical targeted therapies, it is currently solely based on expensive monoclonal antibodies, which often inflict immune-related adverse events. Herein, we propose a novel small-molecule inhibitor targeted at the most clinically relevant immune checkpoint, PD-1/PD-L1. The compound is capable of disrupting the PD-1/PD-L1 complex by antagonizing PD-L1 and, therefore, restores activation of T cells similarly to the antibodies, while being cheap in production and possibly nonimmunogenic. The final compound is significantly smaller than others reported in the literature while being nontoxic to cells even at high concentrations. The scaffold was designed using a structure-activity relationship screening cascade based on a new antagonist-induced dissociation NMR assay, called the weak-AIDA-NMR. Weak-AIDA-NMR finds true inhibitors, as opposed to only binders to the target protein, in early steps of lead compound development, and this process makes it less time and cost consuming.",2020-09-23
32928590,Octreotide for resuscitation of cardiac arrest due to carcinoid crisis precipitated by novel peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT): A case report.,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an effective treatment for metastatic carcinoid tumours but can precipitate a carcinoid crisis through release of stored bioamines. Cardiac arrest is an uncommon manifestation of carcinoid crisis and has never been reported as a complication of PRRT. We report a case of a 58-year old female who suffered from cardiac arrest following PRRT for metastatic carcinoid tumour. She was successfully resuscitated using intravenous octreotide following 22 min of failure to resuscitate with a standard advanced cardiac life support protocol. Following resuscitation, severe carcinoid heart disease was diagnosed, and the patient subsequently underwent successful surgical valve replacement. Although there is no trial evidence, considering pharmacological rationale and successful outcome in this case, we suggest early administration of intravenous octreotide during resuscitation of patients suffering cardiac arrest post PRRT for carcinoid disease and recommend preventive strategies.",2020-08-17
32923118,Regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment and vascular normalization in TNBC murine models by a novel peptide.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly metastatic and aggressive disease with limited treatment options. Recently, the combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) with nab-paclitaxel was approved following a clinical trial that showed response rates in at least 43% of patients. While this approval marks a major advance in the treatment of TNBC it may be possible to improve the efficacy of ICI therapies through further modulation of the suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Several factors may limit immune response in TNBC including aberrant growth factor signaling, such as VEGFR2 and cMet signaling, inefficient vascularization, poor delivery of drugs and immune cells, and the skewing of immune cell populations toward immunosuppressive phenotypes. Here we investigate the immune-modulating properties of AXT201, a novel 20 amino-acid integrin-binding peptide in two syngeneic mouse TNBC models: 4T1-BALB/c and NT4-FVB. AXT201 treatment improved survival in the NT4 model by 20% and inhibited the growth of 4T1 tumors by 47% over 22 days post-inoculation. Subsequent immunohistochemical analyses of 4T1 tumors also showed a 53% reduction in vascular density and a 184% increase in pericyte coverage following peptide treatment. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated evidence of a more favorable anti-tumor immune microenvironment following treatment with AXT201, including significant decreases in the populations of T regulatory cells, monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and PD-L1 expressing cells and increased expression of T cell functional markers. Together, these findings demonstrate immune-activating properties of AXT201 that could be developed in combination with other immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of TNBC.",2020-05-14

32913007,GPR183-Oxysterol Axis in Spinal Cord Contributes to Neuropathic Pain.,"Neuropathic pain is a debilitating public health concern for which novel non-narcotic therapeutic targets are desperately needed. Using unbiased transcriptomic screening of the dorsal horn spinal cord after nerve injury we have identified that <i>Gpr183</i> (Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2) is upregulated after chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats. GPR183 is a chemotactic receptor known for its role in the maturation of B cells, and the endogenous ligand is the oxysterol 7<i>α</i>,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7<i>α</i>,25-OHC). The role of GPR183 in the central nervous system is not well characterized, and its role in pain is unknown. The profile of commercially available probes for GPR183 limits their use as pharmacological tools to dissect the roles of this receptor in pathophysiological settings. Using <i>in silico</i> modeling, we have screened a library of 5 million compounds to identify several novel small-molecule antagonists of GPR183 with nanomolar potency. These compounds are able to antagonize 7<i>α</i>,25-OHC-induced calcium mobilization <i>in vitro</i> with IC<sub>50</sub> values below 50 nM. <i>In vivo</i> intrathecal injections of these antagonists during peak pain after CCI surgery reversed allodynia in male and female mice. Acute intrathecal injection of the GPR183 ligand 7<i>α</i>,25-OHC in naïve mice induced dose-dependent allodynia. Importantly, this effect was blocked using our novel GPR183 antagonists, suggesting spinal GPR183 activation as pronociceptive. These studies are the first to reveal a role for GPR183 in neuropathic pain and identify this receptor as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We have identified several novel GPR183 antagonists with nanomolar potency. Using these antagonists, we have demonstrated that GPR183 signaling in the spinal cord is pronociceptive. These studies are the first to reveal a role for GPR183 in neuropathic pain and identify it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",2020-09-10
32911066,"Surface-engineered nanoliposomes with lipidated and non-lipidated peptide-dendrimeric scaffold for efficient transdermal delivery of a therapeutic agent: Development, characterization, toxicological and preclinical performance analyses.","The current study aimed to develop novel peptide dendrimer (PD)-conjugated nanoliposomal formulations of asenapine maleate (ASP) for improvement in the transdermal delivery and pharmacokinetic profile of the drug. Novel arginine-terminated PDs (+/-lipidation) were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis, followed by conjugation onto ASP nanoliposomes. The nanoliposomes were characterized for particle size (and polydispersity index), zeta potential (ZP), drug entrapment efficiency, shape and morphology, differential scanning calorimetry and FT-IR spectroscopy. Ex vivo skin permeation and retention studies demonstrated considerably higher percutaneous permeation of ASP from the developed nanoliposomes (Q<sub>24</sub> = 794.31 ± 54.89 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>, J<sub>ss</sub> = 105.40 ± 4.8 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>/h, ER = 36.85 ± 2.89 for liposomes with lipidated peptide dendrimer (Lipo-PD2)) in comparison with passive diffusion studies (Q<sub>24</sub> = 63.09 ± 3.56 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>, J<sub>ss</sub> = 3.01 ± 0.23 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>/h). Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) confirmed the higher percutaneous penetration of Lipo-PD2 in comparison with liposomes without the dendrimer. In vitro cytotoxicity determined on HaCaT cell line demonstrated CTC<sub>50</sub> of >1000 µg/mL for both the synthesized PDs and Lipo-PD2. Pharmacokinetic studies in male Sprague Dawley rats revealed considerably and significantly higher t<sub>1/2</sub> = 82.32 ± 14.48 h and AUC<sub>0-t</sub> = 4403.34 ± 367.10 h.ng/mL, from the developed formulation, compared to orally administered ASP (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 21.64 ± 2.53 h and AUC<sub>0-t</sub> = 2303.55 ± 444.5 h.ng/mL), demonstrating higher bioavailability and longer retention in vivo. Additionally, in vivo skin retention, brain uptake studies and pharmacodynamics of the developed formulations were investigated. Stability studies indicated that the formulations were stable up to relatively stable with respect to size, ZP and drug content for 4 months at the tested conditions. This study demonstrates that the developed PD-conjugated nanoliposomal formulations can effectively serve as a transdermal delivery strategy for ASP.",2020-09-08
32905903,Adaptable antigen matrix platforms for peptide vaccination strategies and T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.,"Injection of antigenic peptides has been widely used as a vaccine strategy to boost T cell immunity. However, the poor immunogenicity of single peptides can potentially be strengthened through modification of the tertiary structure and the selection of the accompanying adjuvant. Here, we generated antigenic peptides into non-linear trimers by solid phase peptide synthesis, thereby enhancing antigen presentation by dendritic cells to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro and in vivo. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice vaccinated with trimers showed an KLRG1<sup>+</sup> effector phenotype and were able to recognize and kill antigen-expressing tumor cells ex vivo. Importantly, trimers outperformed synthetic long peptide in terms of T cell response even when equal number of epitopes were used for immunization. To improve the synthesis of trimers containing difficult peptide sequences, we developed a novel small molecule that functions as conjugation platform for synthetic long peptides. This platform , termed Antigen MAtriX (AMAX) improved yield, purity and solubility of trimers over conventional solid phase synthesis strategies. AMAX outperformed synthetic long peptides in terms of both CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and allowed functionalization with DC-SIGN-binding carbohydrates for in vivo dendritic cell targeting strategies, boosting T cell responses even further. Moreover, we show that agonistic CD40 antibody combined with MF59 (AddaVax) emulsion synergistically improves the antigen-specific T cell response of the AMAX in vivo. Also, tumor-associated antigens and neo-antigens could be incorporated in AMAX for tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Importantly, immunization with a mix of neoantigen AMAX could reduce tumor growth in a pre-clinical syngeneic mouse model. Hence, we provide pre-clinical support for the induction of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through the adaptable AMAX platform as easy implementable peptidic vaccination strategy against any antigen of choice, including neoantigens for anti-tumor immunity.",2020-08-28

The object of this study is to explore the role of microRNA-215-5p in psoriasis-like inflammation. The expression of miR-215-5p was found to be down-regulated in pro-inflammatory factor-stimulated HaCaT cells and imiquimod (IMQ)-treated skin tissues. Overexpression of miR-215-5p suppressed the proliferation and cell cycle progression of HaCaT cells. Further, miR-215-5p agomir alleviated the disease severity, pathological features and Ki67 positive cells in IMQ-treated mice. Luciferase assay confirmed that miR-215-5p could bind to the 3'UTR of DYRK1A. The in vitro and in vivo results showed that miR-215-5p negatively regulates DYRK1A, which further inhibited EGFR and its downstream signalling pathways, AKT and ERK. Collectively, our results provide evidence that overexpression of miR-215-5p inhibits the proliferation of HaCaT cells and alleviates psoriasis-like inflammation partly by DYRK1A mediated inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway. miR-215-5p may serve as a novel small molecule for therapeutic intervention in psoriasis.",2020-09-20
32867384,"A Novel Peptide Antibiotic, Pro10-1D, Designed from Insect Defensin Shows Antibacterial and Anti-Inflammatory Activities in Sepsis Models.","Owing to the challenges faced by conventional therapeutics, novel peptide antibiotics against multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria need to be urgently developed. We had previously designed Pro9-3 and Pro9-3D from the defensin of beetle <i>Protaetia brevitarsis</i>; they showed high antimicrobial activity with cytotoxicity. Here, we aimed to develop peptide antibiotics with bacterial cell selectivity and potent antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria. We designed 10-meric peptides with increased cationicity by adding Arg to the N-terminus of Pro9-3 (Pro10-1) and its D-enantiomeric alteration (Pro10-1D). Among all tested peptides, the newly designed Pro10-1D showed the strongest antibacterial activity against <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, and MDR strains with resistance against protease digestion. Pro10-1D can act as a novel potent peptide antibiotic owing to its outstanding inhibitory activities against bacterial film formation with high bacterial cell selectivity. Dye leakage and scanning electron microscopy revealed that Pro10-1D targets the bacterial membrane. Pro10-1D inhibited inflammation via Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4)/Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, Pro10-1D ameliorated multiple-organ damage and attenuated systemic infection-associated inflammation in an <i>E. coli</i> K1-induced sepsis mouse model. Overall, our results suggest that Pro10-1D can potentially serve as a novel peptide antibiotic for the treatment of gram-negative sepsis.",2020-08-27
32867207,"Fraternine, a Novel Wasp Peptide, Protects against Motor Impairments in 6-OHDA Model of Parkinsonism.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that affects the Central Nervous System (CNS). Insect venoms show high molecular variability and selectivity in the CNS of mammals and present potential for the development of new drugs for the treatment of PD. In this study, we isolated and identified a component of the venom of the social wasp <i>Parachartergus fraternus</i> and evaluated its neuroprotective activity in the murine model of PD. For this purpose, the venom was filtered and separated through HPLC; fractions were analyzed through mass spectrometry and the active fraction was identified as a novel peptide, called Fraternine. We performed two behavioral tests to evaluate motor discoordination, as well as an apomorphine-induced rotation test. We also conducted an immunohistochemical assay to assess protection in TH+ neurons in the <i>Substantia Nigra</i> (SN) region. Group treated with 10 μg/animal of Fraternine remained longer in the rotarod compared to the lesioned group. In the apomorphine test, Fraternine decreased the number of rotations between treatments. This dose also inhibited dopaminergic neuronal loss, as indicated by immunohistochemical analysis. This study identified a novel peptide able to prevent the death of dopaminergic neurons of the SN and recover motor deficit in a 6-OHDA-induced murine model of PD.",2020-08-27
32866560,Targeting and therapeutic peptide-based strategies for polycystic kidney disease.,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is characterized by progressive cyst growth and is a leading cause of renal failure worldwide. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options available to PKD patients, and only one drug, tolvaptan, has been FDA-approved to slow cyst progression. Similar to other small molecule drugs, however, tolvaptan is costly, only moderately effective, and causes adverse events leading to high patient dropout rates. Peptides may mitigate many drawbacks of small molecule drugs, as they can be highly tissue-specific, biocompatible, and economically scaled-up. Peptides can function as targeting ligands that direct therapies to diseased renal tissue, or be potent as therapeutic agents themselves. This review discusses various aberrant signaling pathways in PKD and renal receptors that can be potential targets of peptide-mediated strategies. Additionally, peptides utilized in other kidney applications, but may prove useful in the context of PKD, are highlighted. Insights into novel peptide-based solutions that have potential to improve clinical management of PKD are provided.",2020-08-29

32845561,Self-Assembled Peptide-Based Biocomposites for Near-Infrared Light Triggered Drug Release to Tumor Cells.,"Peptide-based nanomaterials are increasingly gaining popularity due to their specificity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. In this work, a new multi-layered peptide-based biocomposite for targeting MCF-7 breast cancer cells is developed. The amphipathic Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-Leu-Ser peptide is synthesized, which is conjugated to a tumor-targeting peptide sequence Gly-Cys-Gly-Asn-Ser to form Fmoc-L-S-G-C-G-N-S (FLS) assemblies. To the FLS assemblies, gold nanorods are then attached to develop drug delivery vehicles (DDVs). The DDVs are entrapped with the anti-cancer drug fulvestrant. Entrapment efficiency is found to be 50.6%. Release studies indicate that irradiating the gold nanorod bound DDVs at NIR wavelength (785 nm) increases drug release by fourfold compared to assemblies that are not irradiated. These results also show higher cytotoxicity and lower cell invasion due to photo-triggered drug release. Furthermore, distinct actin cytoskeletal changes are observed. Such novel peptide-based gold nanorod bound DDVs demonstrate potential in dual targeting of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.",2020-09-15
32832942,"Multi-component peptide hydrogels - a systematic study incorporating biomolecules for the exploration of diverse, tuneable biomaterials.","Peptide-based supramolecular gels can be designed to be functional ""smart"" materials that have applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and supramolecular chemistry. Although many multi-component gel systems have been designed and reported, many of these applications still rely solely on single-component gel systems which limits the functionalities of the materials. Multi-component self-assembly leads to the formation of highly ordered and complex architectures while offering the possibility to generate hydrogels with interesting properties including functional complexity and diverse morphologies. Being able to incorporate various classes of biomolecules can allow for tailoring the materials' functionalities to specific application needs. Here, a novel peptide amphiphile, myristyl-Phe-Phe (C14-FF), was synthesized and explored for hydrogel formation. The hydrogel possesses a nanofiber matrix morphology, composed of β-sheet aggregates, a record-low gelation concentration for this class of compounds, and a unique solvent-dependent helical switch. The C14-FF hydrogel was then explored with various classes of biomolecules (carbohydrates, vitamins, proteins, building blocks of HA) to generate a multi-component library of gels that have potential to represent the complex natural extracellular matrix. Selected multi-component gels exhibit an excellent compatibility with mesenchymal stem cells showing high cell viability percentages, which holds great promise for applications in regenerative therapy.",2020-08-24
32831305,Assays for Validating Histone Acetyltransferase Inhibitors.,"Lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) catalyze acetylation of lysine residues on histones and other proteins to regulate chromatin dynamics and gene expression. KATs, such as CBP/p300, are under intense investigation as therapeutic targets due to their critical role in tumorigenesis of diverse cancers. The development of novel small molecule inhibitors targeting the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) function of KATs is challenging and requires robust assays that can validate the specificity and potency of potential inhibitors. This article outlines a pipeline of three methods that provide rigorous in vitro validation for novel HAT inhibitors (HATi). These methods include a test tube HAT assay, Chromatin Hyperacetylation Inhibition (ChHAI) assay, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR). In the HAT assay, recombinant HATs are incubated with histones in a test tube reaction, allowing for acetylation of specific lysine residues on the histone tails. This reaction can be blocked by a HATi and the relative levels of site-specific histone acetylation can be measured via immunoblotting. Inhibitors identified in the HAT assay need to be confirmed in the cellular environment. The ChHAI assay uses immunoblotting to screen for novel HATi that attenuate the robust hyperacetylation of histones induced by a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). The addition of an HDACi is helpful because basal levels of histone acetylation can be difficult to detect via immunoblotting. The HAT and ChHAI assays measure global changes in histone acetylation, but do not provide information regarding acetylation at specific genomic regions. Therefore, ChIP-qPCR is used to investigate the effects of HATi on histone acetylation levels at gene regulatory elements. This is accomplished through selective immunoprecipitation of histone-DNA complexes and analysis of the purified DNA through qPCR. Together, these three assays allow for the careful validation of the specificity, potency, and mechanism of action of novel HATi.",2020-08-06
32828427,Uridine natural products: Challenging targets and inspiration for novel small molecule inhibitors.,"Nucleoside derivatives, in particular those featuring uridine, are familiar components of the nucleoside family of bioactive natural products. The structural complexity and biological activities of these compounds have inspired research from organic chemistry and chemical biology communities seeking to develop novel approaches to assemble the challenging molecular targets, to gain inspiration for enzyme inhibitor development and to fuel antibiotic discovery efforts. This review will present recent case studies describing the total synthesis and biosynthesis of uridine natural products, and de novo synthetic efforts exploiting features of the natural products to produce simplified scaffolds. This research has culminated in the development of complementary strategies that can lead to effective uridine-based inhibitors and antibiotics. The strengths and challenges of the juxtaposing methods will be illustrated by examining select uridine natural products. Moreover, structure-activity relationships (SAR) for each natural product-inspired scaffold will be discussed, highlighting the impact on inhibitor development, with the aim of future uridine-based small molecule expansion.",2020-07-30
32828426,Synthesis and activity of isoleucine sulfonamide derivatives as novel botulinum neurotoxin serotype A light chain inhibitors.,"The botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is the most lethal protein known to man causing the deadly disease botulinum. The neurotoxin, composed of a heavy (HC) and light (LC) chain, work in concert to cause muscle paralysis. A therapeutic strategy to treat individuals infected with the neurotoxin is inhibiting the catalytic activity of the BoNT LC. We report the synthesis, inhibition study and computational docking analysis of novel small molecule BoNT/A LC inhibitors. A structure activity relationship study resulted in the discovery of d-isoleucine functionalized with a hydroxamic acid on the C-terminal and a biphenyl with chlorine at C- 2 connected by a sulfonamide linker at the N-terminus. This compound has a measured IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.587 µM for the BoNT/A LC. Computational docking analysis indicates the sulfonamide linker adopts a geometry that is advantageous for binding to the BoNT LC active site. In addition, Arg363 is predicted to be involved in key binding interactions with the scaffold in this study.",2020-07-23
32827570,Development of peptide therapeutics: A nonclinical safety assessment perspective.,"Novel peptide drugs continue to gain interest as effective modalities against previously undruggable targets. As with any other technology, development and safety assessment of peptides presents with various complex challenges. Additionally, there is a lack of specific regulatory guidance for peptide development, with the industry relying mainly on associating existing small molecule [ICH M3(R2)] and biologic [ICH S6(R1)] guidance. To gain insights into regulatory requirements for therapeutic peptides, we developed a dataset of peptides approved in the United States from 1998 through 2019 for which the summary basis of approval (SBA) packages are publicly available. The dataset comprises a total of 47 peptides (22 chemically synthesized, 6 semi-synthetic, 18 recombinant, and 1 natural). This article summarizes our learnings from the dataset in regards to the development paradigm, guidances followed, strategies for selection of toxicology species; requirements and/or value of genotoxicity and immunogenicity assessment; impurity, metabolite, and safety pharmacology assessment; and safety assessment of peptides containing non-proteogenic amino acids. In the context of the learnings from the dataset, the authors provide their recommendations for improvement of strategies to develop peptide drugs.",2020-08-19
32812694,"Characterisation of a novel peptide, Brevinin-1H, from the skin secretion of Amolops hainanensis and rational design of several analogues.","As drug-resistant bacteria have become a serious health problem and have caused thousands of deaths, finding new antibiotics has become an urgent research priority. A novel antimicrobial peptide, named Brevinin-1H, was identified in the skin secretion of Amolops hainanensis through 'shotgun' cloning. It has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against tested micro-organisms and has anticancer cell activity. To improve its bioactivity and decrease its cytotoxicity, two structural analogues-Brevinin-1Ha and Brevinin-1HY-were designed based on the secondary structure of the natural peptide. Brevinin-1HY, in which tyrosine substituted Pro<sup>11</sup> , had similar activity to the natural peptide against Gram-negative bacteria and cancer cells, but showed a dramatic increase in haemolytic activity and cytotoxicity at its minimum inhibitory concentration. Brevinin-1Ha, which transferred the Rana-box from the C-terminal to a central position, had significantly decreased haemolytic activity, but also in antimicrobial and anticancer activity. The present data suggest that increasing the proportion of α-helix structure in an AMP can increase its target micro-organism bioactivity to some extent.",2020-09-07
32786271,Design of a Sea Snake Antimicrobial Peptide Derivative with Therapeutic Potential against Drug-Resistant Bacterial Infection.,"Infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens are a worldwide challenge for public health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are regarded as promising antibiotic alternatives for the treatment of drug-resistant infections. In the present study, a series of small peptides were designed based on our previously reported sea snake AMP Hc-CATH. From them, the lead peptide HC1-D2, a truncated peptide entirely substituted by d-amino acids, was selected. HC1-D2 exhibited significantly improved stability and antibiofilm and anti-inflammatory activities. Meanwhile, HC1-D2 retained potent, broad-spectrum, and rapid antimicrobial properties against bacteria and fungi, especially drug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, HC1-D2 showed low propensity to induce bacterial resistance and low cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity. Notably, HC1-D2 showed potent <i>in vivo</i> anti-infective ability in mouse peritonitis models infected by both standard and drug-resistant bacteria. It significantly decreased the bacterial counts in the abdominal cavity and spleen of mice and apparently increased the survival rates of the mice. Acting through the MAPKs inflammatory pathway, HC1-D2 selectively induced the production of chemokine and the subsequent immune cell recruitment to the infection site, while inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines with undesirable toxicities. These much improved properties make HC1-D2 a promising candidate for the development of novel peptide anti-infective agents against drug-resistant infections.",2020-08-28
32781587,Modification and Targeted Design of N-Terminal Truncates Derived from Brevinin with Improved Therapeutic Efficacy.,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of molecules that play an essential role in innate immune regulation. The Brevinin-1 family are AMPs that show strong pharmacological and antimicrobial potential. A novel peptide, B1A, was designed based on the primary structure of brevinin-1PLb and brevinin-1PLc. Subsequently, a synthesised replicate was subjected to a series of bioassays and was found to display antimicrobial activity. However, it also displayed high levels of haemolysis in a horse red blood cell haemolytic assay, suggesting potential toxicity. Therefore, we rationally designed a number of B1A analogues with aim of retaining antimicrobial activity, lowering toxicity, and to explore the structure-activity relationship of its N-terminus. B1A and its analogues still retained the ""Rana Box"" and the FLP-motif, which is a feature of this subfamily. However, the introduction of Lys and Trp residues into the peptide sequences revealed that antimicrobial activity of these analogues remained unchanged once the hydrophobicity and the charge reached the threshold. Hence, the idea that the hydrophobicity saturation in different situations is related to antimicrobial activity can be understood via the structure-activity relationship. Meanwhile, it could also be the starting point for the generation of peptides with specific antimicrobial activity.",2020-08-06

32768201,Identification and characterization of novel small molecule inhibitors to control Mycoplasma gallisepticum infection in chickens.,"Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) causes chronic respiratory disease in chickens, leading to severe economic losses to the poultry industry. Currently the disease is managed with antimicrobials and vaccination; however, emergence of multi-drug resistant Mycoplasma and the limited effect of vaccines necessitate development of novel approaches. A library of 4,182 small molecules (SMs) was screened for identification of narrow spectrum anti-MG compounds using high throughput screening. A total of 584 SMs were identified. Ten SMs possessed low MICs (0.78-100 μM) with efficacy against multiple MG strains and MG biofilm. These 10 SMs did not affect commensal/probiotic bacteria and other avian and foodborne pathogens. They displayed no or little toxicity on the avian macrophage HD-11 cells, human epithelial Caco-2 cells, and chicken red blood cells (RBCs); but, they were effective in reducing MG in chicken RBCs. Six SMs (SM1, SM3-5, and SM9-10) were tested in three-week-old chickens infected with MG (nasal spray; 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/bird). SM4 and SM9 reduced airsacculitis by 77.2 % and 82.9 %, MG load in the trachea by 0.9 log (p < 0.05) and 2.7 log (p < 0.0001), and tracheal mucosal thickness by 23 % and 61 %, respectively with no impact on the richness and evenness of the cecal (P = 0.6; H = 1.0) and tracheal (P = 0.8; H = 0.8) microbiota compared to the MG-infected controls. Both SM4 and SM9 treatments resulted in a significant alteration in the cell membrane conformation of MG. In conclusion; we identified two novel growth inhibitors of MG that are effective in chickens. These findings will facilitate development of novel antibacterials to control mycoplasmosis in poultry.",2020-07-12
32766160,"The Design, Characterizations, and Tumor Angiogenesis Inhibition of a Multi-Epitope Peptibody With bFGF/VEGFA.","Tumor angiogenesis is dependent on growth factors, and inhibition of their pathways is one of the promising strategies in cancer therapy. However, resistance to single pathway has been a great concern in clinical trials so that it necessitates multiple targetable factors for developing tumor angiogenesis inhibitors. Moreover, the strategy of Fc fusion protein is an attractive platform for novel peptide agents, which gains increasing importance with FDA approval because of better immunogenicity and stability. Here, we applied the Fc fusion protein concept to bFGF/VEGFA pathways and designed a multi-epitope Peptibody with immunogenic peptides derived from human bFGF and VEGFA sequences. Immunization with Peptibody could elicit high-titer anti-bFGF and anti-VEGFA antibodies, activate T cells, and induce Th1/Th2-type cytokines. In <i>in vitro</i> experiments, the isolated anti-Peptibody antibody inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by decreasing the MAPK/Akt/mTOR signal pathways. In the murine tumor model, pre-immunization with Peptibody suppressed the tumor growth and neovascularization of lung cancer by decreasing the production of bFGF/VEGFA/PDGF, the MAPK/Akt/mTOR signal pathways, and the activation of suppressive cells in tumor sites. Further, the biological characterizations of the recombinant Peptibody were investigated systematically, including protein primary structure, secondary structure, stability, and toxicity. Collectively, the results highlighted the strategy of bFGF/VEGFA pathways and Fc fusion protein in suppressing tumor progression and angiogenesis, which emphasized the potential of multiple targetable factors for producing enduring clinical responses in tumor patients.",2020-07-17
32761504,NMR fragment screening reveals a novel small molecule binding site near the catalytic surface of the disulfide-dithiol oxidoreductase enzyme DsbA from Burkholderia pseudomallei.,"The presence of suitable cavities or pockets on protein structures is a general criterion for a therapeutic target protein to be classified as 'druggable'. Many disease-related proteins that function solely through protein-protein interactions lack such pockets, making development of inhibitors by traditional small-molecule structure-based design methods much more challenging. The 22 kDa bacterial thiol oxidoreductase enzyme, DsbA, from the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei (BpsDsbA) is an example of one such target. The crystal structure of oxidized BpsDsbA lacks well-defined surface pockets. BpsDsbA is required for the correct folding of numerous virulence factors in B. pseudomallei, and genetic deletion of dsbA significantly attenuates B. pseudomallei virulence in murine infection models. Therefore, BpsDsbA is potentially an attractive drug target. Herein we report the identification of a small molecule binding site adjacent to the catalytic site of oxidized BpsDsbA. <sup>1</sup>H<sup>N</sup> CPMG relaxation dispersion NMR measurements suggest that the binding site is formed transiently through protein dynamics. Using fragment-based screening, we identified a small molecule that binds at this site with an estimated affinity of K<sub>D</sub> ~ 500 µM. This fragment inhibits BpsDsbA enzymatic activity in vitro. The binding mode of this molecule has been characterized by NMR data-driven docking using HADDOCK. These data provide a starting point towards the design of more potent small molecule inhibitors of BpsDsbA.",2020-08-06
32759730,A New Inhibitor of Tubulin Polymerization Kills Multiple Cancer Cell Types and Reveals p21-Mediated Mechanism Determining Cell Death after Mitotic Catastrophe.,"Induction of mitotic catastrophe through the disruption of microtubules is an established target in cancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms determining the mitotic catastrophe and the following apoptotic or non-apoptotic cell death remain poorly understood. Moreover, many existing drugs targeting tubulin, such as vincristine, have reduced efficacy, resulting from poor solubility in physiological conditions. Here, we introduce a novel small molecule 2-aminoimidazoline derivative-OAT-449, a synthetic water-soluble tubulin inhibitor. OAT-449 in a concentration range from 6 to 30 nM causes cell death of eight different cancer cell lines in vitro, and significantly inhibits tumor development in such xenograft models as HT-29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) and SK-N-MC (neuroepithelioma) in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that OAT-449, like vincristine, inhibited tubulin polymerization and induced profound multi-nucleation and mitotic catastrophe in cancer cells. HeLa and HT-29 cells within 24 h of treatment arrested in G2/M cell cycle phase, presenting mitotic catastrophe features, and 24 h later died by non-apoptotic cell death. In HT-29 cells, both agents altered phosphorylation status of Cdk1 and of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins NuMa and Aurora B, while G2/M arrest and apoptosis blocking was consistent with p53-independent accumulation in the nucleus and largely in the cytoplasm of p21/waf1/cip1, a key determinant of cell fate programs. This is the first common mechanism for the two microtubule-dissociating agents, vincristine and OAT-449, determining the cell death pathway following mitotic catastrophe demonstrated in HT-29 cells.",2020-08-04
32747027,Identification of a peptide targeting CD56.,"Neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1/CD56) is expressed on immune cells, myoblasts, and malignant cells, and there is a growing demand for the genetic detection of CD56 and CD56-targeted therapy. In the present study, we developed a novel peptide ligand (designated Natein) that binds to human CD56 by using T7 phage display technology. Natein recognized the extracellular region of CD56 and could bind to natural killer (NK) cells and CD56-positive (CD56<sup>+</sup>) cancer cells. CD56<sup>+</sup> cells enriched from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using biotinylated Natein-conjugated microbeads, similarly to CD56 antibody-isolated cells, demonstrated functional cytotoxicity against K562 cells. In addition, Natein could be used to stain CD56<sup>+</sup> lymphoma cells in nasal-type extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma tissues similarly to a CD56 antibody. These findings suggest that Natein has the potential to be alternative to CD56 antibody that could be used for peptide-based cell isolation and diagnosis.",2020-07-06
32731448,Predicted Hotspot Residues Involved in Allosteric Signal Transmission in Pro-Apoptotic Peptide-Mcl1 Complexes.,"Mcl1 is a primary member of the Bcl-2 family-anti-apoptotic proteins (AAP)-that is overexpressed in several cancer pathologies. The apoptotic regulation is mediated through the binding of pro-apoptotic peptides (PAPs) (e.g., Bak and Bid) at the canonical hydrophobic binding groove (CBG) of Mcl1. Although all PAPs form amphipathic α-helices, their amino acid sequences vary to different degree. This sequence variation exhibits a central role in the binding partner selectivity towards different AAPs. Thus, constructing a novel peptide or small organic molecule with the ability to mimic the natural regulatory process of PAP is essential to inhibit various AAPs. Previously reported experimental binding free energies (BFEs) were utilized in the current investigation aimed to understand the mechanistic basis of different PAPs targeted to mMcl1. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations used to estimate BFEs between mMcl1-PAP complexes using Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Solvent Accessible (MMGBSA) approach with multiple parameters. Predicted BFE values showed an excellent agreement with the experiment (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.92). The van-der Waals (ΔG<sub>vdw</sub>) and electrostatic (ΔG<sub>ele</sub>) energy terms found to be the main energy components that drive heterodimerization of mMcl1-PAP complexes. Finally, the dynamic network analysis predicted the allosteric signal transmission pathway involves more favorable energy contributing residues. In total, the results obtained from the current investigation may provide valuable insights for the synthesis of a novel peptide or small organic inhibitor targeting Mcl1.",2020-07-28
32724456,JP1 suppresses proliferation and metastasis of melanoma through MEK1/2 mediated NEDD4L-SP1-Integrin αvβ3 signaling.,"<b>Background:</b> JWA gene is known to down-regulate SP1 and reduces the expression level of Integrin αvβ3. Here, we identified a functional polypeptide (JP1) based on the active fragment of the JWA protein to suppress melanoma growth and metastasis by inhibiting the Integrin αvβ3. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a series of melanoma growth and metastasis mouse models to evaluate anti-melanoma effect of JP1 peptide. <sup>18</sup>F-labeled JP1 (<sup>18</sup>F-NFP-JP1) was detected by Micro-PET assay to demonstrate drug biodistribution. Toxicity test in cynomolgus monkeys and pharmacokinetic studies in rats were done to assess the druggability. The expression of MEK1/2, NEDD4L, SP1 and Integrin αvβ3 were detected <i>in vitro</i> and <i>vivo</i> models. <b>Results:</b> The peptide JP1 with the best anticancer effect was obtained. Micro-PET assay showed that JP1 specifically targeting to melanoma cells <i>in vivo</i>. JP1 inhibited melanoma growth, metastasis, and prolonged the survival of mouse. JP1 reduced the dosage and toxicity in combination with DTIC in melanoma xenograft and allograft mouse models. Cynomolgus monkey toxicity test showed no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of JP1 was 150 mg/kg. Mechanistically, JP1 was shown to activate p-MEK1/2 and triggered SP1 ubiquitination in melanoma cells. NEDD4L, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was activated by p-MEK1/2 and to ubiquitinate SP1 at K685 site, resulting in subsequent degradation. <b>Conclusions:</b> JP1 was developed as a novel peptide that indicated therapeutic roles on proliferation and metastasis of melanoma through the NEDD4L-SP1-Integrin αvβ3 signaling.",2020-07-01
32713278,A Pilot Screen of a Novel Peptide Hormone Library Identified Candidate GPR83 Ligands.,"The identification of novel peptide hormones by functional screening is challenging because posttranslational processing is frequently required to generate biologically active hormones from inactive precursors. We developed an approach for functional screening of novel potential hormones by expressing them in endocrine host cells competent for posttranslational processing. Candidate preprohormones were selected by bioinformatics analysis, and stable endocrine host cell lines were engineered to express the preprohormones. The production of mature hormones was demonstrated by including the preprohormones insulin and glucagon, which require the regulated secretory pathway for production of the active forms. As proof of concept, we screened a set of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and identified protein FAM237A as a specific activator of GPR83, a GPCR implicated in central nervous system and regulatory T-cell function. We identified the active form of FAM237A as a C-terminally cleaved, amidated 9 kDa secreted protein. The related protein FAM237B, which is 64% homologous to FAM237A, demonstrated similar posttranslational modification and activation of GPR83, albeit with reduced potency. These results demonstrate that our approach is capable of identifying and characterizing novel hormones that require processing for activity.",2020-07-25
32709165,Pharmacological Effects of a Novel Bradykinin-Related Peptide (RR-18) from the Skin Secretion of the Hejiang Frog (<i>Ordorrana hejiangensis</i>) on Smooth Muscle.,"Bradykinin (BK) and bradykinin-related peptides (BRPs), which were identified from a diversity of amphibian skin secretions, exerted contractile and relaxing effects on non-vascular and vascular smooth muscle, respectively. Here, we report a novel bradykinin-related peptide with a molecular mass of 1890.2 Da, RVAGPDKPARISGLSPLR, which was isolated and identified from <i>Ordorrana hejiangensis</i> skin secretions, followed by a C-terminal extension sequence VAPQIV. The biosynthetic precursor-encoding cDNA was cloned by the ""shotgun"" cloning method, and the novel RR-18 was identified and structurally confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Subsequently, the myotropic activity of the synthetic replicate of RR-18 was investigated on the rat bladder, uterus, tail artery and ileum smooth muscle. The peptide was named RR-18 in accordance (R = N-terminal arginine, R = C-terminal arginine, 18 = number of residues). In this study, the synthetic replicates of RR-18 showed no agonist/antagonism of BK-induced rat bladder and uterus smooth muscle contraction. However, it displayed an antagonism of bradykinin-induced rat ileum contraction and arterial smooth muscle relaxation. The EC<sub>50</sub> values of BK for ileum and artery, were 214.7 nM and 18.3 nM, respectively. When the tissue was pretreated with the novel peptide, RR-18, at the maximally effective concentration of bradykinin (1 × 10<sup>-6</sup> M), bradykinin-induced contraction of the ileum and relaxation of the arterial smooth muscle was reduced by 50-60% and 30-40%, respectively. In conclusion, RR-18 represents novel bradykinin antagonising peptide from amphibian skin secretions. It may provide new insight into possible treatment options for chronic pain and chronic inflammation.",2020-07-17
32709050,Targeting Cannabinoid Receptors: Current Status and Prospects of Natural Products.,"Cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), as part of the endocannabinoid system, play a critical role in numerous human physiological and pathological conditions. Thus, considerable efforts have been made to develop ligands for CB1 and CB2, resulting in hundreds of phyto- and synthetic cannabinoids which have shown varying affinities relevant for the treatment of various diseases. However, only a few of these ligands are clinically used. Recently, more detailed structural information for cannabinoid receptors was revealed thanks to the powerfulness of cryo-electron microscopy, which now can accelerate structure-based drug discovery. At the same time, novel peptide-type cannabinoids from animal sources have arrived at the scene, with their potential <i>in vivo</i> therapeutic effects in relation to cannabinoid receptors. From a natural products perspective, it is expected that more novel cannabinoids will be discovered and forecasted as promising drug leads from diverse natural sources and species, such as animal venoms which constitute a true pharmacopeia of toxins modulating diverse targets, including voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors such as CB1 and CB2, with astonishing affinity and selectivity. Therefore, it is believed that discovering novel cannabinoids starting from studying the biodiversity of the species living on planet earth is an uncharted territory.",2020-07-17
32707527,Discovery of novel small molecule inhibitors of S100P with in vitro anti-metastatic effects on pancreatic cancer cells.,"S100P, a calcium-binding protein, is known to advance tumor progression and metastasis in pancreatic and several other cancers. Herein is described the in silico identification of a putative binding pocket of S100P to identify, synthesize and evaluate novel small molecules with the potential to selectively bind S100P and inhibit its activation of cell survival and metastatic pathways. The virtual screening of a drug-like database against the S100P model led to the identification of over 100 clusters of diverse scaffolds. A representative test set identified a number of structurally unrelated hits that inhibit S100P-RAGE interaction, measured by ELISA, and reduce in vitro cell invasion selectively in S100P-expressing pancreatic cancer cells at 10 μM. This study establishes a proof of concept in the potential for rational design of small molecule S100P inhibitors for drug candidate development.",2020-07-15
32703405,Novel N-cadherin antagonist causes glioblastoma cell death in a 3D bioprinted co-culture model.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a deadly type of brain cancer. There is a need to identify novel therapies for GBM as current treatments only marginally increase survival. Modelling the complexity of cancerous tissues using 3D bioprinted constructs serves as a novel approach for preclinical testing of anticancer drugs. A novel small molecule antagonist of the cell adhesion molecule, N-cadherin (NCAD), (S)-1-(3,4-Dichlorophenoxy)-3-(4-((S)-2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenoxy)propylamino)piperidin-1-yl)propan-2-ol has shown promise as an anticancer agent. This study investigated the influence of this antagonist on GBM cells bioprinted with astrocytes into 3D constructs. The NCAD antagonist prevented spheroid formation and induced cell death in the 3D model. This is the first demonstration that an NCAD antagonist can cause GBM cell death.",2020-06-22
32700077,Identification of Novel Small-Molecule Kinase Modulators for the Treatment of Neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma represents 8-10% of all childhood cancer cases and is responsible for 15% of all cancer-related deaths in infants. Even though patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease have a good prognosis, the 5-year survival rate of the vast majority of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma is 50%. Despite extensive research efforts to find a cure for neuroblastoma, current treatment options are still limited. The aim of our study was to identify novel therapeutic compounds using high-throughput drug screening of a small molecule kinase inhibitor library containing 960 compounds. This screening resulted in the identification of two compounds, ST013381 and ST022328, that showed pronounced cytotoxic effects in six human neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro while having reduced effects in the BJ-5ta control cell line. These effects were observed in both MYCN-amplified and -non-amplified cells, indicating that these compounds can affect a wide range of neuroblastomas. Our experiments also revealed that several signaling pathways underlie the selective elimination of neuroblastoma cells by the ST013381 and ST022328 compounds. In summary, we have identified two novel compounds with a strong cytotoxic effect in vitro as promising agents for the treatment of neuroblastoma.",2020-04-04
32694171,Redox priming promotes Aurora A activation during mitosis.,"Cell cycle-dependent redox changes can mediate transient covalent modifications of cysteine thiols to modulate the activities of regulatory kinases and phosphatases. Our previously reported finding that protein cysteine oxidation is increased during mitosis relative to other cell cycle phases suggests that redox modifications could play prominent roles in regulating mitotic processes. The Aurora family of kinases and their downstream targets are key components of the cellular machinery that ensures the proper execution of mitosis and the accurate segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells. In this study, x-ray crystal structures of the Aurora A kinase domain delineate redox-sensitive cysteine residues that, upon covalent modification, can allosterically regulate kinase activity and oligomerization state. We showed in both <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts and mammalian cells that a conserved cysteine residue within the Aurora A activation loop is crucial for Aurora A activation by autophosphorylation. We further showed that covalent disulfide adducts of this residue promote autophosphorylation of the Aurora A kinase domain. These findings reveal a potential mechanistic link between Aurora A activation and changes in the intracellular redox state during mitosis and provide insights into how novel small-molecule inhibitors may be developed to target specific subpopulations of Aurora A.",2020-07-21

During a biophysical screen, using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, of a novel small molecule library for the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 Src Homology 2 (STAT3-SH2) low molecular weight interactors we evaluated commercial inhibitors S3I-201 and 5,15-diphenylporphyrin (5, 15-DPP) as positive controls.",2020-07-20
32676053,A Gq Biased Small Molecule Active at the TSH Receptor.,"G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) can lead to G protein and non-G protein initiated signals. By virtue of its structural property, the TSH receptor (TSHR) has a unique ability to engage different G proteins making it highly amenable to selective signaling. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel small molecule agonist to the TSHR which induces primary engagement with G<sub>αq/11</sub>. To identify allosteric modulators inducing selective signaling of the TSHR we used a transcriptional-based luciferase assay system with CHO-TSHR cells stably expressing response elements (CRE, NFAT, SRF, or SRE) that were capable of measuring signals emanating from the coupling of G<sub>α<i>s</i></sub> , G<sub>α<i>q</i>/11</sub>, G<sub>βγ</sub>, and G<sub>α12/13</sub>, respectively. Using this system, TSH activated G<sub>α<i>s</i></sub> , G<sub>α<i>q</i>/11</sub>, and G<sub>α12/13</sub> but not G<sub>βγ</sub>. On screening a library of 50K molecules at 0.1,1.0 and 10 μM, we identified a novel G<sub>q/11</sub> agonist (named MSq1) which activated G<sub>q/11</sub> mediated NFAT-luciferase >4 fold above baseline and had an EC<sub>50</sub>= 8.3 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M with only minor induction of G<sub>αs</sub> and cAMP. Furthermore, MSq1 is chemically and structurally distinct from any of the previously reported TSHR agonist molecules. Docking studies using a TSHR transmembrane domain (TMD) model indicated that MSq1 had contact points on helices H1, H2, H3, and H7 in the hydrophobic pocket of the TMD and also with the extracellular loops. On co-treatment with TSH, MSq1 suppressed TSH-induced proliferation of thyrocytes in a dose-dependent manner but lacked the intrinsic ability to influence basal thyrocyte proliferation. This unexpected inhibitory property of MSq1 could be blocked in the presence of a PKC inhibitor resulting in derepressing TSH induced protein kinase A (PKA) signals and resulting in the induction of proliferation. Thus, the inhibitory effect of MSq1 on proliferation resided in its capacity to overtly activate protein kinase C (PKC) which in turn suppressed the proliferative signal induced by activation of the predomiant cAMP-PKA pathway of the TSHR. Treatment of rat thyroid cells (FRTL5) with MSq1 did not show any upregulation of gene expression of the key thyroid specific markers such as thyroglobulin(Tg), thyroid peroxidase (Tpo), sodium iodide symporter (Nis), and the TSH receptor (Tshr) further suggesting lack of involvement of MSq1 and G<sub>αq/11</sub> activation with cellular differentation. In summary, we identified and characterized a novel G<sub>αq/11</sub> agonist molecule acting at the TSHR and which showed a marked anti-proliferative ability. Hence, Gq biased activation of the TSHR is capable of ameliorating the proliferative signals from its orthosteric ligand and may offer a therapeutic option for thyroid growth modulation.",2020-06-26
32673674,Discovery of a novel small molecule PT109 with multi-targeted effects against Alzheimer's disease in vitro and in vivo.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by impairment of cognitive functions, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that mainly affects the elderly. Currently available anti-AD drugs can only offer limited symptom-relieving effects. ""One-compound-Multitargeted Strategy"" have been recognized as the promising way to win the war against AD. Herein we report a potential anti-AD agent PT109 with multi-functions. First, an 81-kinase screening was carried out and results showed that PT109 potently inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinases and Serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1, which are the important signaling molecules involved in neurogenesis, neuroprotection and neuroinflammation and mildly inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3β as well as protein kinase C gamma, both are involved in AD pathological processes. In addition, invitro studies of immunofluorescent staining and Western blot showed that PT109 might promote the neurogenesis of C17.2 cells and induce synaptogenesis in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We detected and confirmed the neuroprotective effect of PT109 in cultured HT22 cells by MTT assay, dehydrogenase assay, glutathione assay and reactive oxygen species assay. Furthermore, the results of Western blot, ELISA assay and immunofluorescent staining indicated that PT109 attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in BV2 cells and primary astrocytes. The results of Morris water maze and Step-through test indicated that PT109 improved the spatial learning ability in APP/PS1 mice. More importantly, the invivo pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that PT109 had better medicinal properties. Taken together, our findings suggest that PT109 may be a promising candidate for treating AD through multiple targets although further studies are ought to be conducted.",2020-07-13
32671189,"A Small Molecule Inhibitor, OGP46, Is Effective against Imatinib-Resistant BCR-ABL Mutations via the BCR-ABL/JAK-STAT Pathway.","Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by the Philadelphia (Ph<sup>+</sup>) chromosome carrying the BCR-ABL oncogene, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. The discovery of imatinib represents a major success story in the treatment against CML. However, mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain are a major cause of resistance to imatinib, demonstrating that BCR-ABL remains a critical drug target. Here, we investigate a novel small molecule inhibitor, OGP46, for its inhibitory activity against K562, a panel of murine BaF3 cell lines stably expressing either wild-type BCR-ABL or its mutant forms, including T315I. OGP46 exhibits potent activity against imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, including T315I. OGP46 induced cell differentiation accompanied by G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and suppressed the colony formation capacity of cells. Treatment with OGP46 significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression of BCR-ABL in K562 and BaF3-p210-T315I cells. Mechanistically, the anti-cancer activity of OGP46 induced by cell differentiation is likely through the BCR-ABL/JAK-STAT pathway in native BCR-ABL and mutant BCR-ABL, including T315I, of CML cells. Our findings highlight that OGP46 is active against not only native BCR-ABL but also 11 clinically relevant BCR-ABL mutations, including T315I mutation, which are resistant to imatinib. Thus, OGP46 may be a novel strategy for overcoming imatinib-resistance BCR-ABL mutations, including T315I.",2020-06-09

Furthermore, <b>NP19</b> displayed significant <i>in vivo</i> antitumor efficacy in two different mouse models of cancer (a melanoma B16-F10 tumor model and an H22 hepatoma tumor model). Moreover, H&E staining and flow cytometry data suggested that <b>NP19</b> activated the immune microenvironment in the tumor, which may contribute to its antitumor effects. This work shows <b>NP19</b> is a promising lead compound for further development as a new generation of small molecule inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.",2020-07-30
32664215,"A Novel Peptide, CK2.3, Improved Bone Formation in Ovariectomized Sprague Dawley Rats.","Osteoporosis is a bone disease that has no definite cure. Current treatments for osteoporosis are divided into two categories: anti-resorptive and anabolic. However, these treatments are not perfect and have considerable risks. In addition, bone quality often declines over time with these treatments. We designed a peptide, CK2.3, that has both anabolic and anti-resorptive effects on bone. We reported that CK2.3 induced osteoblastic mineralization, promoted bone formation, and suppressed osteoclastogenesis in vivo. The effect of CK2.3 to rescue an osteoporosis phenotype model has never been shown. In this study, we demonstrated the effect of CK2.3 in ovariectomized rats, a standard model of osteoporosis. We systemically injected CK2.3 at 2.3 µg/kg each day for five consecutive days. Micro-computed tomography indicated that CK2.3 increased bone mineral density, (bone volume/tissue volume) BV/TV and (trabecular number) TbN, and decreased (trabecular space) TbSp in the femoral head. Similarly, single photon absorptiometry showed that treatment with CK2.3 increased bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and the pelvis. Additionally, we observed increased femoral shaft stiffness with ovariectomized rats treated with CK2.3. We also detected no significant changes in the weight of organs such as the heart, lung, liver, kidney, and spleen. An advantage of CK2.3 over current treatments was that it not only promoted bone formation but also improved fracture resistance. In conclusion, we demonstrated CK2.3 as a new anabolic treatment for osteoporosis.",2020-07-10

32660129,"A Synthetic Peptide, CK2.3, Inhibits RANKL-Induced Osteoclastogenesis through BMPRIa and ERK Signaling Pathway.","The skeletal system plays an important role in the development and maturation process. Through the bone remodeling process, 10% of the skeletal system is renewed every year. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are two major bone cells that are involved in the development of the skeletal system, and their activity is kept in balance. An imbalance between their activities can lead to diseases such as osteoporosis that are characterized by significant bone loss due to the overactivity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Our laboratory has developed a novel peptide, CK2.3, which works as both an anabolic and anti-resorptive agent to induce bone formation and prevent bone loss. We previously reported that CK2.3 mediated mineralization and osteoblast development through the SMAD, ERK, and AKT signaling pathways. In this study, we demonstrated the mechanism by which CK2.3 inhibits osteoclast development. We showed that the inhibition of MEK by the U0126 inhibitor rescued the osteoclast development of RAW264.7 induced by RANKL in a co-culture system with CK2.3. We observed that CK2.3 induced ERK activation and BMPRIa expression on Day 1 after stimulation with CK2.3. While CK2.3 was previously reported to induce the SMAD signaling pathway in osteoblast development, we did not observe any changes in SMAD activation in osteoclast development with CK2.3 stimulation. Understanding the mechanism by which CK2.3 inhibits osteoclast development will allow CK2.3 to be developed as a new treatment for osteoporosis.",2020-07-09
32660060,A Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor of Endosomal TLRs Reduces Inflammation and Alleviates Autoimmune Disease Symptoms in Murine Models.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a fundamental role in the inflammatory response against invading pathogens. However, the dysregulation of TLR-signaling pathways is implicated in several autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. Here, we show that a novel small molecule TLR-inhibitor (TAC5) and its derivatives TAC5-a, TAC5-c, TAC5-d, and TAC5-e predominantly antagonized poly(I:C) (TLR3)-, imiquimod (TLR7)-, TL8-506 (TLR8)-, and CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (TLR9)-induced signaling pathways. TAC5 and TAC5-a significantly hindered the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), reduced the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and inhibited the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6. Besides, TAC5-a prevented the progression of psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in mice. Interestingly, TAC5 and TAC5-a did not affect Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub> (TLR1/2)-, FSL-1 (TLR2/6)-, or lipopolysaccharide (TLR4)-induced TNF-α secretion, indicating their specificity towards endosomal TLRs (TLR3/7/8/9). Collectively, our data suggest that the TAC5 series of compounds are potential candidates for treating autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis or SLE.",2020-07-09
32633957,Discovery of Novel Small-Molecule Calcium Sensitizers for Cardiac Troponin C: A Combined Virtual and Experimental Screening Approach.,"Heart failure is a leading cause of death throughout the world and is triggered by a disruption of the cardiac contractile machinery. This machinery is regulated in a calcium-dependent manner by the protein complex troponin. Calcium binds to the N-terminal domain of cardiac troponin C (cNTnC) setting into motion the cascade of events leading to muscle contraction. Because of the severity and prevalence of heart failure, there is a strong need to develop small-molecule therapeutics designed to increase the calcium sensitivity of cardiac troponin in order to treat this devastating condition. Molecules that are able to stabilize an open configuration of cNTnC and additionally facilitate the binding of the cardiac troponin I (cTnI) switch peptide have the potential to enable increased calcium sensitization and strengthened cardiac function. Here, we employed a high throughput virtual screening methodology built upon the ability of computational docking to reproduce known experimental results and to accurately recognize cNTnC conformations conducive to small molecule binding using a receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. This approach combined with concurrent stopped-flow kinetic experimental verification led to the identification of a number of sensitizers, which slowed the calcium off-rate. An initial hit, compound <b>4</b>, was identified with medium affinity (84 ± 30 μM). Through refinement, a calcium sensitizing agent, compound <b>5</b>, with an apparent affinity of 1.45 ± 0.09 μM was discovered. This molecule is one of the highest affinity calcium sensitizers known to date.",2020-07-07

32601412,Selection and identification of a novel bone-targeting peptide for biomedical imaging of bone.,"The global burden of bone-related diseases is increasing in the aging society; thus, improved bone targeted imaging for their early identification and treatment are needed. In this study, we screened novel peptide ligands for hydroxyapatite, a major inorganic component of teeth and bones, and identified a peptide enabling in vivo bone targeting and real-time fluorescence bone detection. To isolate peptides highly specific for hydroxyapatite, we used negative and positive selection from a randomized 8-mer peptide phage library and identified hydroxyapatite-specific peptides (HA-pep2, HA-pep3, and HA-pep7). Among these three peptides, HA-pep3 showed the highest binding capacity and superior dissociation constant towards hydroxyapatite surfaces over time (~ 88.3% retained on hydroxyapatite after two weeks). Furthermore, HA-pep3 was highly specific for hydroxyapatite compared to other calcium salt-based materials. Using this superior specificity, HA-pep3 showed higher accumulation in skull, spine, and joints in comparison with scrambled control peptide during real-time whole-body imaging. Ex vivo analysis of the major organs and bone from mice demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in bone was about 3.32 folds higher in the case of HA-pep3 than the one exhibited by the scrambled control peptide. Our study identified a novel approach for targeting ligands for bone specific imaging and can be useful for drug delivery applications.",2020-06-29

32591930,Design and in vitro analysis of SIRT2 inhibitor targeting Parkinson's disease.,"Inhibition of Sirtuin2 (SIRT2) protein rescues the α-synuclein toxicity in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thioacetyl group can structurally mimic the acetyl group and restrain the deacetylating p53 reaction by SIRT2. This work evaluated the biological activity of designed pentapeptides inhibitor containing N-thioacetyl-lysine against SIRT2. Pentapeptide by introducing thioacetyl-lysine as an inhibitor of SIRT2 was screened by molecular docking and synthesized by solid phase method. The inhibition of pure recombinant SIRT2 as well as SIRT2 in serum of PD patients by peptide was done by fluorescent activity assay. The inhibition of SIRT2 was assessed in PC12 cell line by measuring acetylated α-tubulin level. The peptide YKK(ε-thioAc)AM and HRK(ε-thioAc)AM were found to be SIRT2 inhibitors by molecular docking. However, YKK(ε-thioAc)AM was more specific towards SIRT2 than SIRT1 (Sirtuin1). It inhibited recombinant SIRT2 by IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.15 µM and KD values 9.92 × 10<sup>-8</sup>/M. It also inhibited serum SIRT2 of PD. It increased the acetylation of α-tubulin in PC12 neuroblastoma cells which is essential for maintaining the microtubular cell functions of brain.

The first-line therapy for lung cancer treatment is platinum-based chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin. However, the application of present chemotherapies is limited by severe side effects, which stimulates the discovery of new drugs with new anti-tumor mechanisms and fewer side effects. Beneficially, many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from frog skin have been reported to exhibit potent anti-cancer activities with low toxicity, high selectivity and a low propensity to induce resistance. In this study, we first reported an AMP named Dermaseptin-PP, from a rarely studied frog species, <i>Phyllomedusa palliata</i>. Dermaseptin-PP exhibited selective cytotoxicity on H157, MCF-7, PC-3, and U251 MG cancer cells instead of normal HMEC-1 cells with low hemolytic effect. Furthermore, on subcutaneous H157 tumor model of nude mice, Dermaseptin-PP was found to display potent <i>in vivo</i> anti-tumor activity in a dose-related manner without obvious hepatopulmonary side effects. It is widely accepted that AMPs usually work through a membrane disruptive mode, and the confocal laser microscope observation confirmed that Dermaseptin-PP could destroy H157 cell membranes. Further investigation of mechanisms by flow cytometry assay and immunohistochemical analysis unraveled that Dermaseptin-PP also exerted its anti-tumor activity by inducing H157 cell apoptosis via both endogenous mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and exogenous death receptor apoptosis pathway. Herein, we emphasize that the membrane disrupting and the apoptosis activation effects of Dermaseptin-PP both depend on its concentration. Overall, a novel frog skin-derived AMP, named Dermaseptin-PP, was identified for the first time. It possesses strong antimicrobial activity and effective anti-tumor activity by distinct mechanisms. This study revealed the possibility of Dermaseptin-PP for lung cancer treatment and provided a new perspective for designing novel AMP-based anti-tumor candidates with low risk of cytotoxicity.",2020-06-05
32582547,Association of DNA-Methylation Profiles With Immune Responses Elicited in Breast Cancer Patients Immunized With a Carbohydrate-Mimicking Peptide: A Pilot Study.,"Immune response to a given antigen, particularly in cancer patients, is complex and is controlled by various genetic and environmental factors. Identifying biomarkers that can predict robust response to immunization is an urgent need in clinical cancer vaccine development. Given the involvement of DNA methylation in the development of lymphocytes, tumorigenicity and tumor progression, we aimed to analyze pre-vaccination DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from breast cancer subjects vaccinated with a novel peptide-based vaccine referred to as P10s-PADRE. This pilot study was performed to evaluate whether signatures of differentially methylated (DM) loci can be developed as potential predictive biomarkers for prescreening subjects with cancer who will most likely generate an immune response to the vaccine. Genomic DNA was isolated from PBMCs of eight vaccinated subjects, and their DNA methylation profiles were determined using Infinium<sup>®</sup> MethylationEPIC BeadChip array from Illumina. A linear regression model was applied to identify loci that were differentially methylated with respect to anti-peptide antibody titers and with IFN-γ production. The data were summarized using unsupervised-learning methods: hierarchical clustering and principal-component analysis. Pathways and networks involved were predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. We observed that the profile of DM loci separated subjects in regards to the levels of immune responses. Canonical pathways and networks related to metabolic and immunological functions were found to be involved. The data suggest that it is feasible to correlate methylation signatures in pre-treatment PBMCs with immune responses post-treatment in cancer patients going through standard-of-care chemotherapy. Larger and prospective studies that focus on DM loci in PBMCs is warranted to develop pre-screening biomarkers before BC vaccination. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> www.ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT02229084.",2020-06-05
32568737,"Computational study on new natural compound inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1.","Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO), is a speed limiting enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition and metabolism of Tryptophan along Tryptophan-IDO-Kynurenine pathway [1]. Tryptophan is a necessary amino acid for activating cell growth and metabolism. Additionally, the insufficiency of Tryptophan can lead to immune system dysfunction. Raising the level of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase protein can promote stagnation and apoptosis of effector T cells [2].In contrast, the decline in the number of effect T cells naturally protects cancer cells from attack. Therefore, Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase is a potential target for tumour immunotherapy, such as melanoma, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, leukaemia, and so on, especially in solid tumours [3]. In the study, we have done sets of virtual screening aided by computer techniques in order to find potentially effective inhibitors of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase. Firstly, screening based on structure was carried out by Libdock. Then, ADME (adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and toxicity prediction were also analyzed. Molecular docking and 3D-QSAR pharmacophore generation were used to study the mechanism of these compounds and Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase's binding. A molecular dynamic analysis was carried out to assess if these potential compound's binding is stable enough. According to the results of the analysis above, two potential compounds (ZINC000012495022 and ZINC000003791817) from the ZINC database were discovered to interact with Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase with appropriate energy and proved to be none toxic.

The present study investigated changes in the molecular signatures of MIBC cells (TCCSUP and HT1376) after treatment with a novel small molecule, ASR488, to gain knowledge of the mechanisms that inhibited MIBC cell growth. ASR488 treatment initiated apoptotic signaling in MIBC cells. Pathway enrichment analysis was used to analyze the changes in function of differentially expressed genes. Gene Ontology analysis, as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, was also performed. These analyses along with reactome pathway enrichment analyses indicated that the genes upregulated in the ASR488-treated cells are involved in focal adhesion, neurotrophin signaling, p53 signaling, endoplasmic reticulum functioning in terms of protein processing, and pathways related to bladder cancer. The genes downregulated in ASR488-treated MIBC cells were mainly involved in DNA replication, mismatch repair, RNA degradation, nucleotide excision repair and TGFβ signaling (P<0.05). Furthermore, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis revealed an increase in transcripts of the most upregulated genes in ASR 488-treated MIBC cells: <i>CPEB1</i> (36-fold), <i>IL11</i> (30-fold), <i>SFN</i> (20.12-fold) and <i>CYP4F11</i> (15.8-fold). In conclusion, the analysis of biological functions of the most differentially expressed genes revealed possible mechanisms that may be associated with the aggressiveness of MIBC.",2020-05-07
32560222,Preclinical Evaluation of the Novel Small-Molecule MSI-N1014 for Treating Drug-Resistant Colon Cancer via the LGR5/β-catenin/miR-142-3p Network and Reducing Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Transformation.,"Colorectal cancer represents one of the most prevalent malignancies globally, with an estimated 140,000 new cases in the United States alone in 2019. Despite advancements in interventions, drug resistance occurs in virtually all patients diagnosed with late stages of colon cancer. Amplified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is one of the most prevalent oncogenic drivers in patients and induces increased Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) and β-catenin functions, all of which facilitate disease progression. Equally important, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) transformed by cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) further facilitate malignancy by secreting interleukin (IL)-6 and augmenting STAT3 signaling in colon cancer cells and promoting the generation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). Based on these premises, single-targeted therapeutics have proven ineffective for treating malignant colon cancer, and alternative multiple-targeting agents should be explored. Herein, we synthesized a tetracyclic heterocyclic azathioxanthone, MSI-N1014, and demonstrated its therapeutic potential both in vitro and in vivo. First, we used a co-culture system to demonstrate that colon cancer cells co-cultured with CAFs resulted in heightened 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance and tumor sphere-forming ability and increased side populations, accompanied by elevated expression of cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), β-catenin, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), and ATP-binding cassette super-family G member 2 (ABCG2). MSI-N1014 suppressed cell viability, colony formation, and migration in both DLD1 and HCT116 cells. MSI-N1014 treatment led to decreased expressions of oncogenic markers, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), EGFR, and IL-6 and stemness markers such as CD44, β-catenin, and LGR5. More importantly, MSI-N1014 treatment suppressed the transformation of CAFs, and was associated with decreased secretion of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by CAFs. Furthermore, MSI-N1014 treatment resulted in significantly reduced oncogenic properties, namely the migratory ability, tumor-sphere generation, and resistance against 5-FU. Notably, an increased level of the tumor suppressor, miR-142-3p, whose targets include LGR5, IL-6, and ABCG2, was detected in association with MSI-N1014 treatment. Finally, we demonstrated the therapeutic potential of MSI-N1014 in vivo<i>,</i> where combined treatment with MSI-N1014 and 5-FU led to the lowest tumor growth, followed by MSI-N1014 only, 5-FU, and the vehicle control. Tumor samples from the MSI-N1014 group showed markedly reduced expressions of LGR5, β-catenin, IL-6, and mTOR, but increased expression of the tumor suppressor, miR-142-3p, according to qRT-PCR analysis. Collectively, we present preclinical support for the application of MSI-N1014 in treating 5-FU-resistant colon cancer cells. Further investigation is warranted to translate these findings into clinical settings.",2020-06-16
32559345,Novel small-molecule LG1836 inhibits the in vivo growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Unfortunately, although ADT initially prolongs survival, most patients relapse and develop resistance. Clinical failure of these treatments in CRPC highlights the urgent need to develop novel strategies to more effectively block androgen receptor (AR) signaling and target other oncogenic factors responsible for ADT resistance.",2020-06-19
32556702,A Novel Compound YS-5-23 Exhibits Neuroprotective Effect by Reducing β-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1's Expression and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-Induced Cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y Cells.,"The abnormally accumulated amyloid-β (Aβ) and oxidative stress contribute to the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of Aβ. Furthermore, Aβ was reported to increase oxidative stress; then the overproduced oxidative stress continues to increase the expression and activity of BACE1. Consequently, inhibition of both BACE1 and oxidative stress is a better strategy for AD therapy compared with those one-target treatment methods. In the present study, our novel small molecule YS-5-23 was proved to possess both of the activities. Specifically, we found that YS-5-23 reduces BACE1's expression in both SH-SY5Y and Swedish mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpressed HEK293 cells, and it can also suppress BACE1's expression induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, YS-5-23 decreases H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity including alleviating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) because it attenuates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level elevated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Meanwhile, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the anti-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and BACE1 inhibition effect of YS-5-23. Our findings indicate that YS-5-23 may develop as a drug candidate in the prevention and treatment of AD.",2020-06-18
32546966,"A Triple Combination of Metformin, Acetylsalicylic Acid, and Oseltamivir Phosphate Impacts Tumour Spheroid Viability and Upends Chemoresistance in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.","Targeted multimodal approaches need to be strategically developed to control tumour growth and prevent metastatic burden successfully. Breast cancer presents a unique clinical problem because of the variety of cellular subtypes that arise. The tumour stage and cellular subtypes often dictate the appropriate clinical treatment regimen. Also, the development of chemoresistance is a common clinical challenge with breast cancer. Higher doses and additional drug agents can produce additional adverse effects leading to a more aggressive malignancy. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), metformin (Met), and oseltamivir phosphate (OP) were investigated for their efficacy to sensitize MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer and its ﻿tamoxifen (Tmx) resistant variant (MDA-MB-231-TmxR) together in combination with Tmx treatment.",2020-05-25
32543191,"RDP3, A Novel Antigout Peptide Derived from Water Extract of Rice.","Gout and hyperuricemia can seriously affect the quality of life; at present, however, existing medicines are unable to meet all clinical needs. In the current study, a novel peptide (i.e., rice-derived-peptide-3 (RDP3), AAAAMAGPK-NH<sub>2</sub>, 785.97 Da) in water extract obtained from shelled <i>Oryza sativa</i> fruits was identified. Testing revealed that RDP3 (minimum effective concentration 100 μg/kg) did not show both hemolytic and acute toxicity, and reduced uric acid levels in the serum of hyperuricemic mice by inhibiting xanthine oxidase activity and decreasing urate transporter 1 expression. RDP3 also alleviated renal injury in hyperuricemic mice by decreasing NLRP3 inflammasome expression. Furthermore, RDP3 alleviated formalin-induced paw pain and reduced monosodium urate crystal-induced paw swelling and inflammatory factors in mice. Thus, this newly identified peptide reduced uric acid levels and renal damage in hyperuricemic mice and showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, indicating the potential of RDP3 as an antigout medicine candidate.",2020-06-24
32528880,Positive Allosteric Modulation of CD11b as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy Against Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. A major hurdle for improved therapies is immune suppression mediated by the tumor and its microenvironment. The lung tumor microenvironment (TME) contains large numbers of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which suppress the adaptive immune response, increase neo-vascularization of the tumor, and provide pro-tumor factors to promote tumor growth. CD11b is highly expressed on myeloid cells, including TAMs, where it forms a heterodimeric integrin receptor with CD18 (known as CD11b/CD18, Mac-1, CR3, and αMβ2), and plays an important role in recruitment and biological functions of these cells, and is a validated therapeutic target. Here, we describe our pre-clinical studies targeting CD11b in the context of lung cancer, using pharmacologic and genetic approaches that work via positive allosteric modulation of CD11b function. GB1275 is a novel small molecule modulator of CD11b that is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical development. We assess GB1275 treatment effects on tumor growth and immune infiltrates in the murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) syngeneic tumor model. Additionally, as an orthogonal approach to determine mechanisms of action, we utilize our recently developed novel CD11b knock-in (KI) mouse that constitutively expresses CD11b containing an activating isoleucine to glycine substitution at residue 332 in the ligand binding CD11b A-domain (I332G) that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of CD11b activity. We report that pharmacologic modulation of CD11b with GB1275 significantly reduces LLC tumor growth. CD11b KI mice similarly show significant reduction in both the size and rate of LLC tumor growth, as compared to WT mice, mimicking our observed treatment effects with GB1275. Tumor profiling revealed a significant reduction in TAM infiltration in GB1275-treated and in CD11b KI mice, increase in the ratio of M1/M2-like TAMs, and concomitant increase in cytotoxic T cells. The profiling also showed a significant decrease in CCL2 levels and a concomitant reduction in Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in circulation in both groups. These findings suggest that positive allosteric modulation of CD11b reduces TAM density and reprograms them to enhance the adaptive immune response and is a novel therapeutic strategy against lung cancer.",2020-05-21
32523730,Remineralization of enamel caries by an amelogenin-derived peptide and fluoride <i>in vitro</i>.,"Dental caries is one of the most common oral diseases in the world. This study was tantamount to investigate the combinatory effects of an amelogenin-derived peptide (called QP5) and fluoride on the remineralization of artificial enamel caries. The peptide QP5 was synthesized and characterized, and the binding capability of the peptide on hydroxyapatite (HA) and demineralized tooth enamel surface was analysed. Then, the mineralization function of the peptide and fluoride was studied through the spontaneous mineralization testing and remineralization on enamel caries <i>in vitro</i>. First, the novel peptide QP5 could bind on the hydroxyapatite and demineralized tooth enamel surfaces. Second, QP5 can transitorily stabilize the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate and direct the transformation into hydroxyapatite crystals alone and in combination with fluoride. In addition, compared to blocks treated by peptide QP5 alone or fluoride, the sample blocks showed significantly higher surface microhardness, lower mineral loss and shallower lesion depth after treatment with a combination of QP5 and fluoride at high or low concentrations. The peptide QP5 could control the crystallization of hydroxyapatite, and combinatory application of peptide QP5 and fluoride had a potential synergistic effect on the remineralization of enamel caries.",2020-03-03

32506313,Molecular mechanisms and clinical studies of iguratimod for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.,"Iguratimod (IGU) is a novel small molecule anti-rheumatic drug with the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. IGU has various mechanisms of action, including inhibition of prostaglandin E2, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-17 (IL-17) production, inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-induced proinflammatory effects, inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, and promotion of osteoblastic differentiation. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the major subtype of spondyloarthritis that affects the axial skeleton, causing inflammatory back pain, which can lead to impairments in structure and function and a decrease in quality of life. Theories on pathogenesis of AS include misfolding of human leukocyte antigen-B27 during its assembly leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). Activation of UPR genes results in release of TNF-α and IL-17, which have been shown to be important in the development of AS. In addition, current evidence suggests the importance of cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 pathway and MIF in the pathogenesis of AS. Current drugs for the treatment of AS are limited and exploration of effective drugs is needed. IGU may be effective for the treatment of AS given that its mechanisms of action are closely related to the pathogenesis of AS. In fact, several small-scale clinical trials have shown the efficacy of IGU for the treatment of AS. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of IGU that are related to the pathogenesis of AS and clinical trials of IGU for the treatment of AS, providing a reference for future clinical application of IGU for AS.",2020-06-06

32479946,Novel eIF4E/eIF4G protein-protein interaction inhibitors DDH-1 exhibits anti-cancer activity in vivo and in vitro.,"(E)-2-(2-(2,3-dibromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzylidene)hydrazinyl)-4-(3,4-difluorophenyl) thiazole (DDH-1) is novel small molecule compound synthesized in our previous work. This study found that DDH-1 could inhibit the proliferation of various human lung cancer cells. Particularly, the IC<sub>50</sub> for A549 cells was 8.59 μM. Interestingly, we found that DDH-1 inhibits eIF4E/eIF4G interaction. The flow cytometry (FACS) results have indicated that DDH-1 may induce G0/G1 cycle arrest by inhibiting the expression of Cyclin D1 and CDK4. DDH-1 may also cause apoptosis through the caspase-dependent pathway. Study of these mechanisms has shown that DDH-1 may prompt reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and stimulate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in A549 cells. Study of the signal pathway has indicated that DDH-1 could activate JNK phosphorylation and inhibit ERK phosphorylation. Interestingly, NAC, which scavenges ROS, reversed the MMP decline, DNA damage, JNK phosphorylation activation, and ERK phosphorylation inhibition caused by DDH-1. Overall, these findings provide evidence that the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction inhibitors DDH-1 induces DNA damage and apoptosis in human lung cancer A549 cells.",2020-05-29
32479916,Novel peptide-conjugated nanomedicines for brain targeting: In vivo evidence.,"Central nervous system (CNS) compartments remain one of the most difficult districts for drug delivery. This is due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that hampers 90% of drug passage, dramatically requiring non-invasive treatment strategies. Here, for the first time, the use of opioid-derived deltorphin-derivative peptides to drive biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric (i.e. poly-lactide-co-glycolide, PLGA) nanomedicines delivery across the BBB was described. Opioid-derived peptides were covalently conjugated to furnish activated polymers which were further used for fluorescently tagged nanoformulations. Beyond reporting production, formulation methodology and full physico-chemical characterization, in vivo tests generated clear proof of BBB crossing and CNS targeting by engineered nanomedicines opening the research to further applications of drug delivery and targeting in CNS disease models.",2020-05-29
32450253,A novel small molecule STAT3 inhibitor SLSI-1216 suppresses proliferation and tumor growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells through apoptotic induction.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast cancer, characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Owing to the absence of molecular targets, there are limited treatment options, and TNBC patients exhibit high mortality rates. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is overexpressed and aberrantly activated in TNBC cells. Therefore, inhibition of STAT3-mediated signaling provides a potential strategy for the treatment of TNBC. In this study, A series of synthetic derivatives of SLSI-1 (a STAT3 inhibitor) were designed and evaluated for antitumor activity in TNBC cells. A novel derivative (SLSI-1216) exhibited the most potent anti-proliferative activity. SLSI-1216 effectively inhibited STAT3 activity and activation of STAT3, leading to the downregulation of AXL, a downstream target of STAT3 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression. The inhibition of EMT by SLSI-1216 was associated with modulation of E-cadherin and N-cadherin. Furthermore, SLSI-1216 induced apoptosis by targeting STAT3 and effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo. These findings suggest that SLSI-1216, as a potential inhibitor of STAT3, may be a promising therapeutic agent for TNBC.",2020-05-23
32440095,"Pexidartinib, a Novel Small Molecule CSF-1R Inhibitor in Use for Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor: A Systematic Review of Pre-Clinical and Clinical Development.","Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a rare benign tumor that involves the synovium, bursa, and tendon sheath, resulting in reduced mobility of the affected joint or limb. The current standard of care for TGCT is surgical resection. However, some patients have tumor recurrence, present with unresectable tumors, or have tumors that are in locations where resection could result in amputations or significant debility. Therefore, the development of systemic agents with activity against TGCT to expand treatment options is a highly unmet medical need. Pathologically, TGCT is characterized by the overexpression of colony﻿-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), which leads to the recruitment of colony﻿-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) expressing macrophages that make up the primary cell type within these giant cell tumors. The binding of CSF-1 and CSF-1R controls cell survival and proliferation of monocytes and the switch from a monocytic to macrophage phenotype contributing to the growth and inflammation within these tumors. Therefore, molecules that target CSF-1/CSF-1R have emerged as potential systemic agents for the treatment of TGCT. Given the role of macrophages in regulating tumorigenesis, CSF1/CSF1R-targeting agents have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets for solid tumors. Pexidartinib is an orally bioavailable and potent inhibitor of CSF-1R which is one of the most clinically used agents. In this review, we discuss the biology of TGCT and review the pre-clinical and clinical development of pexidartinib which ultimately led to the FDA approval of this agent for the treatment of TGCT as well as ongoing clinical studies utilizing pexidartinib in the setting of cancer.",2020-05-04
32423862,Identification and functional characterization of ribosomal protein S23 as a new member of antimicrobial protein.,"Previous studies show that some ribosomal proteins possess antimicrobial peptide (AMP) activity. However, information as such remains rather fragmentary and rather limited. We showed here for the first time that amphioxus RPS23, BjRPS23, was a previously uncharacterized AMP. It not only acted as a pattern recognition receptor, capable of identifying LPS, LTA and PGN, but also an effector, capable of killing the Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. We also showed that the residues positioned at 67-84 formed the core region for the antimicrobial activity of BjRPS23, and its orthologues Verrucomicrobia RPS12<sub>68-85</sub> and Thermotoga RPS12<sub>65-82</sub> similarly displayed some antibacterial activities. BjRPS23 functioned by a combined action of membranolytic mechanisms including interaction with bacterial membrane via LPS, LTA and PGN, and membrane depolarization. BjRPS23 also stimulated production of intracellular ROS in bacteria. Moreover, we demonstrated that RPS23 existed across widely separated taxa, and might play a universal role in protection against bacterial infection in different animals. In addition, we found that neither BjRPS23 nor its truncated form BjRPS23<sub>67-84</sub> were cytotoxic to mammalian cells, making them promising lead molecules for the design of novel peptide antibiotics against bacteria. Collectively, these indicate that RPS23 is a new member of AMP with ancient origin and high conservation.",2020-05-11
32422996,Highly Conserved Homotrimer Cavity Formed by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein: A Novel Binding Site.,"An important stage in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) life cycle is the binding of the spike (S) protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) host cell receptor. Therefore, to explore conserved features in spike protein dynamics and to identify potentially novel regions for drugging, we measured spike protein variability derived from 791 viral genomes and studied its properties by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The findings indicated that S2 subunit (heptad-repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), and connector domain (CD) domains) showed low variability, low fluctuations in MD, and displayed a trimer cavity. By contrast, the receptor binding domain (RBD) domain, which is typically targeted in drug discovery programs, exhibits more sequence variability and flexibility. Interpretations from MD simulations suggest that the monomer form of spike protein is in constant motion showing transitions between an ""up"" and ""down"" state. In addition, the trimer cavity may function as a ""bouncing spring"" that may facilitate the homotrimer spike protein interactions with the ACE2 receptor. The feasibility of the trimer cavity as a potential drug target was examined by structure based virtual screening. Several hits were identified that have already been validated or suggested to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus in published cell models. In particular, the data suggest an action mechanism for molecules including Chitosan and macrolides such as the mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) pathway inhibitor Rapamycin. These findings identify a novel small molecule binding-site formed by the spike protein oligomer, that might assist in future drug discovery programs aimed at targeting the coronavirus (CoV) family of viruses.",2020-05-14
32422317,Magnetically responsive peptide coacervates for dual hyperthermia and chemotherapy treatments of liver cancer.,"Liver cancer is an aggressive malignancy associated with high levels of mortality and morbidity. Doxorubicin (Dox) is often used to slow down liver cancer progression; however its efficacy is limited, and its severe side effects prevent its routine use at therapeutic concentrations. We present a biomimetic peptide that coacervates into micro-droplets, within which both Dox and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can be sequestered. These Dox-loaded Magnetic Coacervates (DMCs) can be used for thermo-chemotherapy, with the controlled release of Dox triggered by an external Alternating Magnetic Field (AMF). The DMCs are internalized by the cells via an energy-independent mechanism which is not based on endocytosis. Application of AMF generates a temperature of 45 °C within the DMCs, triggering their disassembly and the simultaneous release of Dox, thereby resulting in dual hyperthermia and chemotherapy for more efficient cancer therapy. In vitro studies conducted under AMF reveal that DMCs are cytocompatible and effective in inducing HepG2 liver cancer cell death. Thermo-chemotherapy treatment against HepG2 cells is also shown to be more effective compared to either hyperthermia or chemotherapy treatments alone. Thus, our novel peptide DMCs can open avenues in theranostic strategies against liver cancer through programmable, wireless, and remote control of Dox release. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Simultaneous administration of chemical and thermal therapy (thermo-chemotherapy) is more effective in inducing liver cancer cell death and improving survival rate. Thus, there is a keen interest in developing suitable carriers for thermo-chemotherapy. Coacervate micro-droplets display significant advantages, including high loading capacity, fast self-assembly in aqueous environments, and liquid-like behavior. However, they have not yet been explored as carriers for thermo-chemotherapy. Here, we demonstrate that peptide coacervate micro-droplets can co-encapsulate Dox and magnetic nanoparticles and cross the cell membrane. Applying an alternating magnetic field to cells containing drug-loaded coacervates triggers the release of Dox as well as the localized heating by magnetic hyperthermia, resulting in efficient liver cancer cell death by dual thermo-chemotherapy.",2020-05-15

Here, we used naïve mice to investigate the effects of acute systemic administration of IRL790 on protein levels and phosphorylation states of proteins relevant for synaptic plasticity and transmission. IRL790 increased pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels and phosphorylation at Ser1303 of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype 2B glutamate receptor (NR2B) in prefrontal cortex. IRL790 also increased the phosphorylation states at Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40, respectively, of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatum. IRL790 reduced protein levels of the NR2B receptor in striatum but not in prefrontal cortex. Taken together, we report that systemically administered IRL790 rapidly elicits changes in protein level and phosphorylation state of proteins associated with a beneficial effect on synaptic markers and neurotransmission.

32344824,Development and Characterization of a Novel Peptide-Loaded Antimicrobial Ocular Insert.,"Infectious ocular keratitis is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Bacterial resistance to classical pharmacological treatments raised the interest of researchers towards antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-based therapy. hLF 1-11, a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from the N-terminus of human lactoferrin, proved effective against different bacteria and yeast but, like all proteinaceous materials, it is unstable from chemical, physical, and biological points of view. In this study, new freeze-dried solid matrices containing mucoadhesive polymers were prepared and characterized in terms of rheology, hydration time, bioadhesion, drug content, and in vitro release. The formulation HPMC/T2/HA/hLF 1-11<sub>fd</sub> was selected for the delivery of hLF 1-11, since it showed good drug recovery and no chemical degradation up to at least 6 months (long-term stability). Furthermore, the HPMC/T2/HA/hLF 1-11<sub>fd</sub> matrix allowed for the release of the drug in a simulated physiological environment, linked to an optimal hydration time, and the peptide antimicrobial activity was preserved for up to 15 months of storage, a very promising result considering the chemical liability of proteinaceous material. For its properties, the freeze-dried matrix developed in this study could be a good platform for the delivery of antimicrobial peptides in the precorneal area to treat infectious phenomena of the ocular surface.",2020-04-25
32341035,"Identification of a Small-Molecule Inhibitor That Disrupts the SIX1/EYA2 Complex, EMT, and Metastasis.","Metastasis is the major cause of mortality for patients with cancer, and dysregulation of developmental signaling pathways can significantly contribute to the metastatic process. The Sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1)/eyes absent (EYA) transcriptional complex plays a critical role in the development of multiple organs and is typically downregulated after development is complete. In breast cancer, aberrant expression of SIX1 has been demonstrated to stimulate metastasis through activation of TGFβ signaling and subsequent induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, SIX1 can induce metastasis via non-cell autonomous means, including activation of GLI-signaling in neighboring tumor cells and activation of VEGFC-induced lymphangiogenesis. Thus, targeting SIX1 would be expected to inhibit metastasis while conferring limited side effects. However, transcription factors are notoriously difficult to target, and thus novel approaches to inhibit their action must be taken. Here we identified a novel small molecule compound, NCGC00378430 (abbreviated as 8430), that reduces the SIX1/EYA2 interaction. 8430 partially reversed transcriptional and metabolic profiles mediated by SIX1 overexpression and reversed SIX1-induced TGFβ signaling and EMT. 8430 was well tolerated when delivered to mice and significantly suppressed breast cancer-associated metastasis <i>in vivo</i> without significantly altering primary tumor growth. Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time that pharmacologic inhibition of the SIX1/EYA2 complex and associated phenotypes is sufficient to suppress breast cancer metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify and characterize a novel inhibitor of the SIX1/EYA2 complex that reverses EMT phenotypes suppressing breast cancer metastasis.",2020-04-27

On 6 January 2020, the FDA granted fast track designation to INF for first-line treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. Prediction of susceptible sites of metabolism and reactivity pathways (cyanide and GSH) for INF was performed by the Xenosite web predictor tool. Then, we report the characterization and identification of <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, and reactive intermediates of INF using liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS). Finally, an <i>in silico</i> toxicity assessment of INF metabolites was carried out using the StarDrop DEREK module showing structural alerts. Rat liver microsomes (RLMs) and isolated perfused rat liver hepatocytes were incubated with INF <i>in vitro</i> and the generated metabolites were collected by protein precipitation. <i>In vivo</i> metabolism was evaluated by time-course urine sampling from Sprague-Dawley rats administered a single INF oral dose. A similar volume of acetonitrile was added to each collected urine sample and both organic and aqueous layers were analyzed by LC-ITMS to detect <i>in vivo</i> INF metabolites. <i>N</i>-Ethyl piperazine rings and benzene at part A of the INF structure are metabolized to form iminium and 1,4-benzoquinone, respectively, which are very reactive toward nucleophilic macromolecules. Incubation of INF with RLMs in the presence of 1.0 mM KCN and 1.0 mM glutathione was used to evaluate reactive metabolites potentially responsible for toxicities associated with INF. There were seven <i>in vitro</i> phase I metabolites, three <i>in vitro</i> phase II metabolites, three cyano adducts, and three GSH conjugate metabolites of INF detected by LC-ITMS. <i>In vivo</i> INF metabolites identified included four <i>in vivo</i> phase I and three <i>in vivo</i> phase II metabolites. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> phase I metabolic pathways included <i>N</i>-dealkylation, <i>N</i>-demethylation, <i>O</i>-demethylation, hydroxylation, and dechlorination, while the <i>in vivo</i> phase II metabolic reaction was a direct conjugation of INF with glucuronic acid and sulphate.",2020-04-23
32316235,The Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Receptor GPR84 Mediates Myeloid Cell Infiltration Promoting Steatohepatitis and Fibrosis.,"Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) have been associated with anti-steatotic effects in hepatocytes. Expression of the MCFA receptor GPR84 (G protein-coupled receptor 84) is induced in immune cells under inflammatory conditions and can promote fibrogenesis. We aimed at deciphering the role of GPR84 in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), exploring its potential as a therapeutic target. GPR84 expression is upregulated in liver from patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), correlating with the histological degree of inflammation and fibrosis. In mouse and human, activated monocytes and neutrophils upregulate GPR84 expression. Chemotaxis of these myeloid cells by GPR84 stimulation is inhibited by two novel, small molecule GPR84 antagonists. Upon acute liver injury in mice, treatment with GPR84 antagonists significantly reduced the hepatic recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF). We, therefore, evaluated the therapeutic inhibition of GPR84 by these two novel antagonists in comparison to selonsertib, an apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor, in three NASH mouse models. Pharmacological inhibition of GPR84 significantly reduced macrophage accumulation and ameliorated inflammation and fibrosis, to an extent similar to selonsertib. In conclusion, our findings support that GPR84 mediates myeloid cell infiltration in liver injury and is a promising therapeutic target in steatohepatitis and fibrosis.",2020-04-16
32313651,Targeting Toll-like receptor-4 to tackle preterm birth and fetal inflammatory injury.,"Every year, 15 million pregnancies end prematurely, resulting in more than 1 million infant deaths and long-term health consequences for many children. The physiological processes of labour and birth involve essential roles for immune cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines in gestational tissues. There is compelling evidence that the mechanisms underlying spontaneous preterm birth are initiated when a premature and excessive inflammatory response is triggered by infection or other causes. Exposure to pro-inflammatory mediators is emerging as a major factor in the 'fetal inflammatory response syndrome' that often accompanies preterm birth, where unscheduled effects in fetal tissues interfere with normal development and predispose to neonatal morbidity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical upstream gatekeepers of inflammatory activation. TLR4 is prominently involved through its ability to sense and integrate signals from a range of microbial and endogenous triggers to provoke and perpetuate inflammation. Preclinical studies have identified TLR4 as an attractive pharmacological target to promote uterine quiescence and protect the fetus from inflammatory injury. Novel small-molecule inhibitors of TLR4 signalling, specifically the non-opioid receptor antagonists (+)-naloxone and (+)-naltrexone, are proving highly effective in animal models for preventing preterm birth induced by bacterial mimetic LPS, heat-killed <i>Escherichia coli</i>, or the TLR4-dependent pro-inflammatory lipid, platelet-activating factor (PAF). Here, we summarise the rationale for targeting TLR4 as a master regulator of inflammation in fetal and gestational tissues, and the potential utility of TLR4 antagonists as candidates for preventative and therapeutic application in preterm delivery and fetal inflammatory injury.",2020-04-14
32296013,A novel silicone derivative of natural osalmid (DCZ0858) induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly heterogeneous malignant tumor characterized by diffuse growth. DCZ0858 is a novel small molecule with excellent antitumor effects in DLBCL. This study explored in depth the inhibitory effect of DCZ0858 on DLBCL cell lines. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and plate colony formation assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation levels. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze apoptosis and the cell cycle, and western blotting was used to quantify the expression of cell cycle regulators. The results indicated that DCZ0858 inhibited cell growth in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner while inducing no significant toxicity in normal cells. Moreover, DCZ0858 initiated cell apoptosis via both internal and external apoptotic pathways. DCZ0858 also induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, thereby controlling cell proliferation. Further investigation of the molecular mechanism showed that the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was involved in the DCZ0858-mediated antitumor effects and that JAK2 was the key target for DCZ0858 treatment. Knockdown of JAK2 partly weakened the DCZ0858-mediated antitumor effect in DLBCL cells, while JAK2 overexpression strengthened the effect of DCZ0858 in DLBCL cells. Moreover, a similar antitumor effect was observed for DCZ0858 and the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, and combining the two could significantly enhance cancer-suppressive signaling. Tumor xenograft models showed that DCZ0858 inhibited tumor growth in vivo and had low toxicity in important organs, findings that were consistent with the in vitro data. In summary, DCZ0858 is a promising drug for the treatment of DLBCL.",2020-04-01
32269074,Targeting Opsin4/Melanopsin with a Novel Small Molecule Suppresses PKC/RAF/MEK/ERK Signaling and Inhibits Lung Adenocarcinoma Progression.,"The identification of oncogenic biomolecules as drug targets is an unmet need for the development of clinically effective novel anticancer therapies. In this study, we report for the first time that opsin 4/melanopsin (OPN4) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is a potential drug target. Our study has revealed that OPN4 is overexpressed in human lung cancer tissues and cells, and is inversely correlated with patient survival probability. Knocking down expression of OPN4 suppressed cells growth and induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. We have also found that OPN4, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacted with Gα11 and triggered the PKC/BRAF/MEK/ERKs signaling pathway in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Genetic ablation of <i>OPN4</i> attenuated the multiplicity and the volume of urethane-induced lung tumors in mice. Importantly, our study provides the first report of AE 51310 (1-[(2,5-dichloro-4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl]-3-methylpiperidine) as a small-molecule inhibitor of OPN4, suppressed the anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cells and the growth of patient-derived xenograft tumors in mice. IMPLICATIONS: Overall, this study unveils the role of OPN4 in NSCLC and suggests that targeting OPN4 with small molecules, such as AE 51310 would be interesting to develop novel anticancer therapies for lung adenocarcinoma.",2020-04-08
32253213,Novel Peptide from Commensal Staphylococcus simulans Blocks Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Quorum Sensing and Protects Host Skin from Damage.,"Recent studies highlight the abundance of commensal <u>co</u>agulase-<u>n</u>egative <u>s</u>taphylococci (CoNS) on healthy skin. Evidence suggests that CoNS actively shape the skin immunological and microbial milieu to resist colonization or infection by opportunistic pathogens, including methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), in a variety of mechanisms collectively termed colonization resistance. One potential colonization resistance mechanism is the application of quorum sensing, also called the <u>a</u>ccessory <u>g</u>ene <u>r</u>egulator (<i>agr</i>) system, which is ubiquitous among staphylococci. Common and rare CoNS make autoinducing peptides (AIPs) that function as MRSA <i>agr</i> inhibitors, protecting the host from invasive infection. In a screen of CoNS spent media, we found that <i>Staphylococcus simulans</i>, a rare human skin colonizer and frequent livestock colonizer, released potent inhibitors of all classes of MRSA <i>agr</i> signaling. We identified three <i>S. simulans agr</i> classes and have shown intraspecies cross talk between noncognate <i>S. simulans agr</i> types for the first time. The <i>S. simulans</i> AIP-I structure was confirmed, and the novel AIP-II and AIP-III structures were solved via mass spectrometry. Synthetic <i>S. simulans</i> AIPs inhibited MRSA <i>agr</i> signaling with nanomolar potency. <i>S. simulans</i> in competition with MRSA reduced dermonecrotic and epicutaneous skin injury in murine models. The addition of synthetic AIP-I also effectively reduced MRSA dermonecrosis and epicutaneous skin injury in murine models. These results demonstrate potent anti-MRSA quorum sensing inhibition by a rare human skin commensal and suggest that cross talk between CoNS and MRSA may be important in maintaining healthy skin homeostasis and preventing MRSA skin damage during colonization or acute infection.",2020-05-21

We have designed a novel non-peptide compound LLY17 targeting STAT3 using Advanced Multiple Ligand Simultaneous Docking (AMLSD) methods. However, the efficacy of LLY17 has not been evaluated extensively in human and murine triple-negative breast cancer cells. In this study, we tested LLY17 in multiple human and murine triple-negative breast cancer cell lines.",2020-04-02
32229350,"Quinazoline-4(3H)-one derivatives as novel and potent inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.","Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is considered as a promising target to reduce blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity, and decrease inflammation. In this study, a series of some novel quinazoline-4(3H)-one derivatives (3a-t) with varying steric and electronic properties was designed, synthesized and evaluated as sEH Inhibitors. Most of the synthesized compounds had similar inhibitory activity to the commercial reference inhibitor, 12-(3-adamantan-1-ylureido)dodecanoic acid, and amongst them, 4-chloro-N-(4-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)phenyl)benzamide (3g) was identified as the most active sEH inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.5 nM), about 2-fold more potent compared to the reference inhibitor. The results of molecular modeling followed by biological studies indicate that a quinazolinone ring serves as a suitable scaffold to develop novel small molecule candidates to inhibit sEH and the nature of substituent on the amide moiety has a moderate effect on the activity.",2020-03-20
32219501,A phase I study of multi-HLA-binding peptides derived from heat shock protein 70/glypican-3 and a novel combination adjuvant of hLAG-3Ig and Poly-ICLC for patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers: YNP01 trial.,"This phase I study aimed to evaluate the safety, peptide-specific immune responses, and anti-tumor effects of a novel vaccination therapy comprising multi-HLA-binding heat shock protein (HSP) 70/glypican-3 (GPC3) peptides and a novel adjuvant combination of hLAG-3Ig and Poly-ICLC against metastatic gastrointestinal cancers.",2020-03-26
32219060,Apatinib Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Induces Autophagy in Human Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway.,"<b>Background:</b> Patients with metastatic radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) have limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. There is an urgent need to develop new drugs targeting PTC for clinical application. Apatinib, a novel small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is highly selective for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) and exhibits antitumor effects in a variety of solid tumors. Although apatinib has been shown to be safe and efficacious in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, the mechanism underlying its antitumor effect is unclear. In this report, we explored the effects of apatinib on PTC <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Methods:</b> VEGFR2 expression levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), qPCR, and western blotting (WB). The effects of apatinib on cell viability, colony formation, and migration in the Transwell assay were assessed <i>in vitro</i>, and its effect on tumor growth rate was assessed <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, the levels of proteins in signaling pathways were determined by WB. Finally, the autophagy level was assessed by WB, immunofluorescence (IF), and transmission electron microscopy. <b>Results:</b> We found that high VEGFR2 expression is associated with tumor size, T stage, and lymph node metastasis in patients with PTC and that apatinib inhibits PTC cell growth, promotes apoptosis, and induces cell cycle arrest through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, apatinib induces autophagy, and pharmacological inhibition of autophagy or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated targeting of autophagy-associated gene 5 (ATG5) can further increase PTC cell apoptosis. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our data suggest that apatinib can induce apoptosis and autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway for the treatment of PTC and that autophagy is a potential novel target for future therapy in resistant PTC.",2020-03-11
32217770,"Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic-Efficacy Modeling of ONO-7579, a Novel Pan-Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase Inhibitor, in a Murine Xenograft Tumor Model.","The orally available and novel small molecule ONO-7579 (<i>N</i>-{2-[4-(2-amino-5-chloropyridin-3-yl)phenoxy]pyrimidin-5-yl}-<i>N</i>'-[2-(methanesulfonyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]urea) is a highly potent and selective pan-tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor. The objective of the present study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and antitumor efficacy relationships of ONO-7579 in mice xenografted with a human colorectal cancer cell line, KM12 (harboring the tropomyosin 3 <i>(TPM3)</i> <i>-</i>neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 1 fusion gene), via a PK/PD modeling approach. Plasma and tumor concentrations of ONO-7579, tumor levels of phosphorylated TPM3-TRKA (pTRKA), and tumor volumes in the murine model were measured with a single or multiple dose of ONO-7579 (0.06-0.60 mg/kg) administered once daily. The PK/PD/efficacy models were developed in a sequential manner. Changes in plasma concentrations of ONO-7579 were described with an oral one-compartment model. Tumor concentrations of ONO-7579 were higher than plasma concentrations, and changes in ONO-7579 tumor concentrations were described with an additional tumor compartment that had no influence on plasma concentrations. pTRKA in tumors was described with a direct E<sub>max</sub> model, and the tumor ONO-7579 concentration causing 50% of the maximum effect was estimated to be 17.6 ng/g. In addition, a pTRKA-driven tumor growth inhibition model indicated that ONO-7579 started to sharply increase the antitumor effect at pTRKA inhibition rates >60% and required >91.5% to reduce tumors. In conclusion, the developed PK/PD/efficacy models revealed a ""switch-like"" relationship between pTRKA inhibition rate and antitumor effect in a murine KM12 xenograft model, demonstrating that pTRKA in tumors could serve as an effective biomarker for scheduling the dose regimen in early-stage clinical studies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In recent years, clinical development of TRK inhibitors in patients with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase fusion-positive solid tumors has been accelerated. This research found that phosphorylated TRKA was a useful biomarker for explaining the antitumor efficacy of TRK inhibitors using a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling approach in xenograft mice. This finding suggests a rational dosing regimen in early-stage clinical studies for ONO-7579 (<i>N</i>-{2-[4-(2-amino-5-chloropyridin-3-yl)phenoxy]pyrimidin-5-yl}-<i>N</i>'-[2-(methanesulfonyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]urea), a novel pan-TRK inhibitor.",2020-03-26
32210956,Novel Peptide-Based PD1 Immunomodulators Demonstrate Efficacy in Infectious Disease Vaccines and Therapeutics.,"Many pathogens use the same immune evasion mechanisms as cancer cells. Patients with chronic infections have elevated levels of checkpoint receptors (e.g., programed cell death 1, PD1) on T cells. Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based inhibitors to checkpoint receptors have also been shown to enhance T-cell responses in models of chronic infection. Therefore, inhibitors have the potential to act as a vaccine ""adjuvant"" by facilitating the expansion of vaccine antigen-specific T-cell repertoires. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a peptide-based class of PD1 checkpoint inhibitors, which have a potent adaptive immunity adjuvant capability for vaccines against infectious diseases. Briefly, after identifying peptides that bind to the recombinant human PD1, we screened for <i>in vitro</i> efficacy in reporter assays and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) readouts. We first found the baseline <i>in vivo</i> performance of the peptides in a standard mouse oncology model that demonstrated equivalent efficacy compared to mAbs against the PD1 checkpoint. Subsequently, two strategies were used to demonstrate the utility of our peptides in infectious disease indications: (1) as a therapeutic in a bacteria-induced lethal sepsis model in which our peptides were found to increase survival with enhanced bacterial clearance and increased macrophage function; and (2) as an adjuvant in combination with a prophylactic malaria vaccine in which our peptides increased T-cell immunogenicity and the protective efficacy of the vaccine. Therefore, our peptides are promising as both a therapeutic agent and a vaccine adjuvant for infectious disease with a potentially safer and more cost-effective target product profile compared to mAbs. These findings are essential for deploying a new immunomodulatory regimen in infectious disease primary and clinical care settings.",2020-03-06
35496622,Discovery of lixisenatide analogues as long-acting hypoglycemic agents using novel peptide half-life extension technology based on mycophenolic acid.,"Noncovalent binding of peptides to human serum albumin protects against renal clearance and enzymatic degradation. Herein, we investigated the effect of mycophenolic acid (MPA) albumin binders for improving the stability of peptides. For proof-of-principle, the short acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist lixisenatide was selected and functionalized with different MPA albumin binders. <i>In vitro</i>, all lixisenatide analogues showed well preserved GLP-1 receptor activation potency. High performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) and ultrafiltration analyses indicated that DiMPA was able to confer high albumin affinity to lixisenatide and revealed that affinity is increased for DiMPA modified lixisenatide analogues containing OEG spacers. In <i>db/db</i> mice, the selected peptide 2c showed comparable efficacies to lixisenatide with respect to glucose-lowering and insulinotropic activities. Furthermore, the duration of action of glucose homeostasis of 2c was comparable to semaglutide in <i>db/db</i> mice. Importantly, DiMPA albumin binder did not bring significant toxicity of lixisenatide, as reflected by the comparable toxicity indexes in 2c and semaglutide groups after 2 weeks dosing in normal Kunming mice. Short-term study (21 days) conducted on <i>db/db</i> mice showed the better therapeutic efficacies of 2c than semaglutide on pancreas islets protection. Importantly, in chronic studies (84 days) on <i>db/db</i> mice, 2c exhibited a sustained improvement in glycaemic control, to a greater extent than that of semaglutide. Thus, we propose DiMPA modification as a novel and general method for development of long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes treatments, and 2c as a promising antidiabetic candidate.",2020-03-25

32172172,Immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether for purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptide from casein hydrolysate.,"Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.",2020-02-25
32165998,EB1-dependent long survival of glioblastoma-grafted mice with the oral tubulin-binder BAL101553 is associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors with limited treatment options. Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) contribute to GBM invasiveness, representing promising targets. BAL101553, a prodrug of BAL27862, is a novel small molecule tubulin-binding agent, promoting tumor cell death through spindle assembly checkpoint activation, which is currently in Phase 1/2a in advanced solid tumor patients including GBM. This study aimed to evaluate long-term daily oral BAL101553 treatment of mice orthotopically grafted with GBM CSLCs (GBM6) according to EB1 expression-level, and to decipher its mechanism of action on GBM stem cells. Oral treatment with BAL101553 for 100 days provoked a large EB1 expression level-dependent survival benefit, together with a decrease in tumor growth and brain invasion. Formation of vascular structures by the fluorescent GBM6-GFP-sh0 cells, mimicking endothelial vascular networks, was observed in the brains of control grafted mice. Following BAL101553 treatment, vessels were no longer detectable, suggesting inhibition of the endothelial trans-differentiation of GBM stem cells. <i>In vitro</i>, BAL27862 treatment resulted in a switch to the endothelial-like phenotype of GBM6 towards an astrocytic phenotype. Moreover, the drug inhibited secretion of VEGF, thus preventing normal endothelial cell migration activated by CSLCs. The decrease in VEGF secretion was confirmed in a human GBM explant following drug treatment. Altogether, our data first confirm the potential of EB1 expression as a response-predictive biomarker of BAL101553 in GBM we previously published and add new insights in BAL101553 long-term action by counteracting CSLCs mediated tumor angiogenesis. Our results strongly support BAL101553 clinical studies in GBM patients.",2020-02-25

32143270,APP Maturation and Intracellular Localization Are Controlled by a Specific Inhibitor of 37/67 kDa Laminin-1 Receptor in Neuronal Cells.,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed along both the nonamyloidogenic pathway preventing amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) production and the amyloidogenic pathway, generating Aβ, whose accumulation characterizes Alzheimer's disease. Items of evidence report that the intracellular trafficking plays a key role in the generation of Aβ and that the 37/67 kDa LR (laminin receptor), acting as a receptor for Aβ, may mediate Aβ-pathogenicity. Moreover, findings indicating interaction between the receptor and the key enzymes involved in the amyloidogenic pathway suggest a strong link between 37/67 kDa LR and APP processing. We show herein that the specific 37/67 kDa LR inhibitor, NSC48478, is able to reversibly affect the maturation of APP in a pH-dependent manner, resulting in the partial accumulation of the immature APP isoforms (unglycosylated/acetylated forms) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in transferrin-positive recycling endosomes, indicating alteration of the APP intracellular trafficking. These effects reveal NSC48478 inhibitor as a novel small molecule to be tested in disease conditions, mediated by the 37/67 kDa LR and accompanied by inactivation of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) signalling and activation of Akt (serine/threonine protein kinase) with consequent inhibition of GSK3β.",2020-03-04

Here we describe the rationale and design of OCEAN (NCT03151811), a randomized, head-to-head, superiority, open-label, global, Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of melflufen + dexamethasone versus pomalidomide + dexamethasone. Eligible patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma have received 2-4 previous treatments and are refractory to both lenalidomide and their last treatment. Patients are excluded if they have previously received pomalidomide. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, and key secondary endpoints include overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival.",2020-03-06
32138951,Development and therapeutic potential of vasopressin synthetic analog [V<sup>4</sup>Q<sup>5</sup>]dDAVP as a novel anticancer agent.,"Since its discovery, arginine vasopressin (AVP) was subjected to several modifications with the aim of obtaining novel derivatives with increased potency and selectivity for biomedical use. Desmopressin (dDAVP) is a first generation synthetic analog of AVP with hemostatic and antimetastatic activity. dDAVP acts as a selective agonist of the arginine vasopressin type 2 receptor (AVPR2) present in microvascular endothelium and cancer cells. Considering its selective effects on AVPR2-expressing malignant and vascular tissue, and interesting antitumor profile, dDAVP was used as a lead compound for the development of novel peptide analogs with enhanced anticancer efficacy. After conducting different structure-activity relationship studies to determine key aminoacidic positions for its antitumor activity against AVPR2-expressing malignant cells, dDAVP was rationally modified and a wide panel of synthetic analogs with different sequence and structural modifications was assessed. As a result of this structure-based drug derivatization novel AVP analog [V<sup>4</sup>Q<sup>5</sup>]dDAVP (1-deamino-4-valine-5-glutamine-8-d-arginine vasopressin) was selected as the most active candidate and further developed. [V<sup>4</sup>Q<sup>5</sup>]dDAVP was evaluated in highly aggressive and metastatic cancer preclinical models deploying enhanced cytostatic, antimetastatic and angiostatic effects in comparison to parental peptide dDAVP. In addition, novel compound demonstrated good tolerability as evaluated in several toxicological studies, and cooperative therapeutic effects after combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. In summary, due to its ability to inhibit growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis, as well as impairing progression of metastatic disease, AVP analogs such as novel [V<sup>4</sup>Q<sup>5</sup>]dDAVP are promising compounds for further development as coadjuvant agents for the management of advance or recurrent cancers.",2020-01-13
32127468,Identification of ALDH1A3 as a Viable Therapeutic Target in Breast Cancer Metastasis-Initiating Cells.,"The development of efficacious therapies targeting metastatic spread of breast cancer to the brain represents an unmet clinical need. Accordingly, an improved understanding of the molecular underpinnings of central nervous system spread and progression of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) is required. In this study, the clinical burden of disease in BCBM was investigated, as well as the role of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3 (ALDH1A3) in the metastatic cascade leading to BCBM development. Initial analysis of clinical survival trends for breast cancer and BCBM determined improvement of breast cancer survival rates; however, this has failed to positively affect the prognostic milestones of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) brain metastases (BM). ALDH1A3 and a representative epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene signature (mesenchymal markers, CD44 or Vimentin) were compared in tumors derived from BM, lung metastases (LM), or bone metastases (BoM) of patients as well as mice after injection of TNBC cells. Selective elevation of the EMT signature and ALDH1A3 were observed in BM, unlike LM and BoM, especially in the tumor edge. Furthermore, ALDH1A3 was determined to play a role in BCBM establishment via regulation of circulating tumor cell adhesion and migration phases in the BCBM cascade. Validation through genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of ALDH1A3 via lentiviral shRNA knockdown and a novel small-molecule inhibitor demonstrated selective inhibition of BCBM formation with prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. Given the survival benefits via targeting ALDH1A3, it may prove an effective therapeutic strategy for BCBM prevention and/or treatment.",2020-03-03
32108998,PDRPS7 protects cardiac cells from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury through inactivation of JNKs.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major complication of reperfusion therapy in myocardial infarction. Ischemic myocardium produces a variety of peptides. We recently identified PDRPS7 as a novel peptide in cardiomyocytes that can be induced by hypoxia. However, the role of PDRPS7 is unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of PDRPS7 on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced injury in rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells and NRCMs. We found that PDRPS7 improved cell survival and attenuated lactate dehydrogenase leakage following H/R in H9c2 cells and NRCMs. PDRPS7 also alleviated H/R-induced pulsation reduction in NRCMs. Moreover, H/R-induced cell apoptosis was decreased in the presence of PDRPS7. H/R-induced reactive oxygen species generation was reduced by PDRPS7; in addition, PDRPS7 did not impact H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -induced cell injury. Signaling analysis demonstrated that H/R increased the phosphorylation levels of JNKs, ERKs, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. However, PDRPS7 only attenuated H/R-induced JNK phosphorylation, but not phosphorylation of ERKs and p38. PDRPS7 protected cardiomyocytes from apoptosis by inhibiting JNK phosphorylation and c-Jun phosphorylation pathways, markedly upregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting that of pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved caspase-3. Importantly, pharmacological activation of JNKs diminished the protective effect of PDRPS7 in terms of cell survival against H/R stimulation. In summary, our study identified PDRPS7 as a novel cardioprotective peptide against H/R challenge and this action was mediated, at least in part, through inactivation of JNKs.",2020-03-16
32101780,Novel small molecule therapeutic agents for Alzheimer disease: Focusing on BACE1 and multi-target directed ligands.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that effects 50 million people worldwide. In this review, AD pathology and the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting AD were fully discussed. In particular, common approaches to prevent Aβ production and/or accumulation in the brain including α-secretase activators, specific γ-secretase modulators and small molecules BACE1 inhibitors were reviewed. Additionally, natural-origin bioactive compounds that provide AD therapeutic advances have been introduced. Considering AD is a multifactorial disease, the therapeutic potential of diverse multi target-directed ligands (MTDLs) that combine the efficacy of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors, MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitors, BACE1 inhibitors, phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) inhibitors, for the treatment of AD are also reviewed.

32086622,Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Tissue Distribution Characteristics of SHetA2 in Tumor-Bearing Mice.,"The orally available novel small molecule SHetA2 is the lead sulfur-containing heteroarotinoid that selectively inhibits cancer cells over normal cells, and is currently under clinical development for anticancer treatment and cancer prevention. The objective of this study was to assess and characterize the tissue distribution of SHetA2 in tumor-bearing mice by developing a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. An orthotopic SKOV3 ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model was used to most accurately mimic the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment in the peritoneal cavity. SHetA2 concentrations in plasma and 14 different tissues were measured at various time points after a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg and oral dose of 60 mg/kg, and these data were used to develop a whole-body PBPK model. SHetA2 exhibited a multi-exponential plasma concentration decline with an elimination half-life of 4.5 h. Rapid and extensive tissue distribution, which was best described by a perfusion rate-limited model, was observed with the tissue-to-plasma partition coefficients (k<sub>p</sub> = 1.4-21.2). The PBPK modeling estimated the systemic clearance (76.4 mL/h) from circulation as a main elimination pathway of SHetA2. It also indicated that the amount absorbed into intestine was the major determining factor for the oral bioavailability (22.3%), while the first-pass loss from liver and intestine contributed minimally (< 1%). Our results provide an insight into SHetA2 tissue distribution characteristics. The developed PBPK model can be used to predict the drug exposure at tumors or local sites of action for different dosing regimens and scaled up to humans to correlate with efficacy.",2020-02-21
32085666,"The Novel Small-molecule Annexin-A1 Mimetic, Compound 17b, Elicits Vasoprotective Actions in Streptozotocin-induced Diabetic Mice.","The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family are a group of G-protein coupled receptors that play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory processes. It is well-established that activation of FPRs can have cardioprotective properties. Recently, more stable small-molecule FPR1/2 agonists have been described, including both Compound 17b (Cmpd17b) and Compound 43 (Cmpd43). Both agonists activate a range of signals downstream of FPR1/2 activation in human-engineered FPR-expressing cells, including ERK1/2 and Akt. Importantly, Cmpd17b (but not Cmpd43) favours bias away from intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilisation in this context, which has been associated with greater cardioprotection in response to Cmpd17b over Cmpd43. However, it is unknown whether these FPR agonists impact vascular physiology and/or elicit vasoprotective effects in the context of diabetes. First, we localized FPR1 and FPR2 receptors predominantly in vascular smooth muscle cells in the aortae of male C57BL/6 mice. We then analysed the vascular effects of Cmpd17b and Cmpd43 on the aorta using wire-myography. Cmpd17b but not Cmpd43 evoked a concentration-dependent relaxation of the mouse aorta. Removal of the endothelium or blockade of endothelium-derived relaxing factors using pharmacological inhibitors had no effect on Cmpd17b-evoked relaxation, demonstrating that its direct vasodilator actions were endothelium-independent. In aortae primed with elevated K<sup>+</sup> concentration, increasing concentrations of CaCl<sub>2</sub> evoked concentration-dependent contraction that is abolished by Cmpd17b, suggesting the involvement of the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilisation via voltage-gated calcium channels. Treatment with Cmpd17b for eight weeks reversed endothelial dysfunction in STZ-induced diabetic aorta through the upregulation of vasodilator prostanoids. Our data indicate that Cmpd17b is a direct endothelium-independent vasodilator, and a vasoprotective molecule in the context of diabetes.",2020-02-18
32082974,"PCC0208017, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of MARK3/MARK4, suppresses glioma progression <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.","Gliomas are the most common primary intracranial neoplasms among all brain malignancies, and the microtubule affinity regulating kinases (MARKs) have become potential drug targets for glioma. Here, we report a novel dual small-molecule inhibitor of MARK3 and MARK4, designated as PCC0208017. <i>In vitro,</i> PCC0208017 strongly inhibited kinase activity against MARK3 and MARK4, and strongly reduced proliferation in three glioma cell lines.

32069907,"Flavonoid Profile of the <i>Genista tridentata</i> L., a Species Used Traditionally to Treat Inflammatory Processes.","Ethnopharmacological surveys on Portuguese flora reveal that <i>Genista</i> <i>tridentata</i> L. is a shrub used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various inflammation-related health problems, although scientific support of its benefits is still necessary. In order to establish the anti-inflammatory potential of <i>G. tridentata</i> and support its traditional use, ethanolic extracts of three sections of the plant (root, stem, and leaves) were subjected to in vitro evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulates macrophages as an inflammation model. Simultaneously, we also aimed to establish the extracts' flavonoids profile. The ethanolic extracts, obtained by Soxhlet extraction, profile of the three sections confirmed their richness in flavonoids, being three prenylated flavonoids isolated and characterized in the root, including a new natural compound, the 3-methoxymundulin. The extracts from the three plant sections showed strong antioxidant activity at the cellular level and significantly inhibit the LPS-triggered NO production by downregulating <i>Nos2</i> gene transcription and consequently iNOS expression. Additionally, root and stem extracts also decreased the LPS-induced transcription of the pro-inflammatory genes <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Il6</i>, and <i>Ptgs2</i>. Thus, the results support the anti-inflammatory properties attributed to <i>G. tridentate</i> preparations. Relevantly, the roots of the shrub, plant part not used, is an unexplored source of compounds with pharmacological and nutraceutical value.",2020-02-13

32064871,Two Distinct Mechanisms of Inhibition of LpxA Acyltransferase Essential for Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis.,"The lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway is considered an attractive drug target against the rising threat of multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report two novel small-molecule inhibitors (compounds <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>) of the acyltransferase LpxA, the first enzyme in the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway. We show genetically that the antibacterial activities of the compounds against efflux-deficient <i>Escherichia coli</i> are mediated by LpxA inhibition. Consistently, the compounds inhibited the LpxA enzymatic reaction in vitro. Intriguingly, using biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization, we reveal two distinct mechanisms of LpxA inhibition; compound <b>1</b> is a substrate-competitive inhibitor targeting apo LpxA, and compound <b>2</b> is an uncompetitive inhibitor targeting the LpxA/product complex. Compound <b>2</b> exhibited more favorable biological and physicochemical properties than compound <b>1</b> and was optimized using structural information to achieve improved antibacterial activity against wild-type <i>E. coli</i>. These results show that LpxA is a promising antibacterial target and imply the advantages of targeting enzyme/product complexes in drug discovery.",2020-02-17
32037968,Extensive immunoinformatics study for the prediction of novel peptide-based epitope vaccine with docking confirmation against envelope protein of Chikungunya virus: a computational biology approach.,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) instigating Chikungunya fever is a global infective menace resulting in high fever, weakened joint-muscle pain, and brain inflammation. Inaccessibility and unavailability of effective drugs have led us to an uncertain arena when it comes to providing proper medical treatment to the affected people. In this study, authentic encroachment has been made concerning the peptide-based epitope vaccine designing against CHIKV. A Proteome-wide search was performed to locate a conserved portion among the accessible viral outer membrane proteins which showcase a remarkable immune response using specific immunoinformatics and docking simulation tools. Primarily, the most probable immunogenic envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 were identified from the UniProt database depending on their antigenicity scores. Subsequently, we selected two distinctive sequences ""SEDVYANTQLVLQRP"" and ""IMLLYPDHPTLLSYR"" in both E1 and E2 glycoproteins respectively. These two sequences identified as the most potent T and B cell epitope-based peptides as they interacted with 6 and 7 HLA-I and 5 HLA-II molecules with an extremely low IC50 score that was verified by molecular docking. Moreover, the sequences possess no allergenicity and are certainly located outside the transmembrane region. In addition, the sequences exhibited 88.46% and 100.00% Conservancy, covering high population coverage of 89.49% to 94.74% and 60.51% to 88.87% respectively in endemic countries. The identified peptide SEDVYANTQLVLQRP and IMLLYPDHPTLLSYR can be utilized next for the development of peptide-based epitope vaccine contrary to CHIKV, so further documentations and experimentations like Antigen testing, Antigen production, Clinical trials are needed to prove the validity of it.

32035657,Inhibitors Targeting RIPK1/RIPK3: Old and New Drugs.,"The scaffolding function of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) regulates prosurvival signaling and inflammatory gene expression, while its kinase activity mediates both apoptosis and necroptosis; the latter involving RIPK3 kinase activity. The mutual transition between the scaffold and kinase functions of RIPK1 is regulated by (de)ubiquitylation and (de)phosphorylation. RIPK1-mediated cell death leads to disruption of epithelial barriers and/or release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and chemokines, propagating inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Many drug development programs have pursued targeting RIPK1, and to a lesser extent RIPK3 kinase activity. In this review, we classify existing and novel small-molecule drugs based on their pharmacodynamic (PD) type I, II, and III binding mode. Finally, we discuss their applicability and therapeutic potential in inflammatory and degenerative experimental disease models.",2020-02-05
32027983,"Expression, purification, and characterization of human mannose-6-phosphate receptor - Extra cellular domain from a stable cell line utilizing a small molecule biomimetic of the mannose-6-phosphate moiety.","The cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR, aka insulin-like growth factor II receptor or IGFIIR) is a membrane protein that plays a central role in the trafficking of lysosomal acid hydrolases into lysosomes via mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) binding domains. In order to maintain cellular metabolic/catabolic homeostasis, newly synthesized lysosomal acid hydrolases are required to bind to M6PR for transit. Acid hydrolases secreted by cells can also be internalized via M6PR residing on the cell membrane and are transported to the lysosomes, a feature that enables enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of several lysosomal storage disorders. Therefore, a thorough characterization of this receptor is critical to the development of lysosomal enzyme-based therapeutics that utilize M6PR for drug delivery to the lysosome. However, the extracellular domain (ECD) of M6PR is highly complex, containing 15-mannose receptor homology (MRH) domains. In addition, homodimerization of the receptor can occur at the membrane, making its characterization challenging. In this study, a novel human M6PR (hM6PR)-overexpressing cell line originally established for hM6PR cellular uptake assay was utilized for production of hM6PR-ECD, and a novel small molecule biomimetic (aminophenyl-M6P) affinity resin was developed for the purification of M6PR-ECD. The affinity-purified hM6PR-ECD was monomeric, contained 14 intact MRH domains (1-14) and a partial MRH domain 15, and was successfully employed in ELISA-based and surface plasmon resonance-based binding assays to demonstrate its ligand-binding functionality, making it suitable for the evaluation of biotherapeutics that utilize M6PR for cellular internalization.",2020-02-03
32007668,Discovery of novel akt1 inhibitor induces autophagy associated death in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,"In this study, a series of thieno [2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as novel AKT1 inhibitors. In vitro antitumor assay results showed that compounds 9d-g and 9i potently suppressed the enzymatic activities of AKT1 and potently inhibited the proliferation of HepG2, Hep3B, Huh-7 and SMMC-7721 cancer cell lines. Among these derivatives, the compound 9f demonstrated the best inhibitory activities on AKT1 (IC50 = 0.034 μM) and Huh-7 cell (IC50 = 0.076 μM). A panel of biological assays showed that compound 9f suppressed the cellular proliferation of Huh-7 through Akt/mTOR signaling pathway mediated autophagy mechanism.

32002708,Regression of castration-resistant prostate cancer by a novel compound QW07 targeting androgen receptor N-terminal domain.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) via surgical or chemical castration frequently fails to halt lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is induced by multiple mechanisms involving constitutive androgen receptor (AR) splice variants, AR mutation, and/or de novo androgen synthesis. The AR N-terminal domain (NTD) possesses most transcriptional activity and is proposed as a potential target for CRPC drug development. We constructed a screening system targeting AR-NTD transcription activity to screening a compound library and identified a novel small molecule compound named QW07. The function evaluation and mechanism investigation of QW07 were carried out in vitro and in vivo. QW07 bound to AR-NTD directly, blocked the transactivation of AR-NTD, blocked interactions between co-regulatory proteins and androgen response elements (AREs), inhibited the expression of genes downstream of AR, and inhibited prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. QW07 was demonstrated as an AR-NTD-specific antagonist with the potential to inhibit both canonical and variant-mediated AR signaling to regress the CRPC xenografts and is proposed as a lead compound for a specific antagonist targeting AR-NTD.",2020-01-30
